  <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/victim-services/seeking-victim-information/seeking-victim-information-in-2x2-investigation"
  target="_blank">announced this week</a> that it is looking for help from the public
  in identifying people with &#x201C;knowledge of abuse and/or criminal behavior&#x201D;
  in an insular, nameless religious sect, often referred to by outsiders as the &#x201C;Two
  by Twos.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>As VICE News detailed in <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7zpvm/an-nameless-insular-religious-sect-is-being-rocked-by-a-massive-sexual-abuse-scandal"
  target="_blank">an investigation in October,</a> the group is in the midst of a
  dramatic reckoning with a decades-long pattern of sexual abuse, often committed
  against children by people in the community with a high degree of spiritual authority.
  Both current members of the sect and people who have left it have accused the group
  of failing to alert secular authorities when individuals are said to have molested
  children.</p> <div class="article__embed article__embed--vice" data-related-article="true"

  <p>For several weeks, former members of the community who have become anti-abuse
  activists have told VICE News that it appears the FBI is investigating the group.
  The FBI generally does not confirm or deny active investigations; reached for comment
  last week, an FBI spokesperson in their Seattle office gave the usual response,
  telling VICE News, &#x201C;The FBI&#x2019;s media policy prohibits confirming or
  denying an investigation unless in rare circumstances.&#x201D; The same spokesperson
  did not immediately respond to a follow-up request for comment. But the request
  for help from the Omaha office is exceedingly clear that the group is being investigated;
  the agency even created <a href="https://forms.fbi.gov/2x2" target="_blank">an online
  questionnaire </a>for people with knowledge or direct experience of the abuse.&#xA0;</p>
  <p>The group &#x2013; usually referred to by insiders as &#x201C;The Truth&#x201D;
  or &#x201C;The Way&#x201D; &#x2013; has a lineage that stretches back over 100 years.
  The name &#x201C;Two by Twos&#x201D; is drawn from the fact that its preachers,
  known as &#x201C;workers,&#x201D; are homeless and itinerant, traveling in pairs
  around territories composed of several states to lead prayer meetings held in people&#x2019;s
  homes. Workers are often expected to sleep in the houses of congregants, which several
  people told VICE News has led to sexual abuse committed against children. Above
  workers are &#x201C;overseers,&#x201D; who in the United States have control over
  territories that include several states. Both workers and overseers have been accused
  of sexual abuse, committed both in the homes of congregants and during large conventions
  held yearly.&#xA0;</p> <p>The current tumult began in March 2023, when a letter
  began circulating disclosing that an Oregon overseer named Dean Bruer had been a
  &#x201C;sexual predator&#x201D; whose patterns of alleged abuse first came to light
  after he abruptly died in a hotel room in the remote community of Government Camp.
  The letter, said to have been written by Bruer&#x2019;s successor Doyle Smith, added:
  &#x201C;His actions include rape and abuse of underage victims. He <i>totally</i>
  abused his authority as an overseer in order to control, manipulate and threaten
  his victims. We are strongly recommending our staff look at the Ministry Safe Program
  and possibly other venues that help understand, recognize, and prevent such problems.&#x201D;
  (Italics his.)&#xA0;</p> <p>Notably, this letter does not suggest that Bruer&#x2019;s
  alleged behavior was referred to legal authorities. (Smith did not respond to a
  previous request for comment from VICE News.) Sources within the community told
  VICE News that instead of alerting law enforcement, sexual abuse allegations were
  often handled by temporarily removing the accused person from prayer meetings, or,
  in the case of workers, seemingly moving them to a different territory.&#xA0;</p>
  <p>Former members of the group told VICE News that one specific overseer, Darryl
  Doland, an overseer for Washington state, received a visit from FBI agents. There
  is no evidence that Doland is himself accused of abuse or any other crime; he has,
  however, been unusually transparent in his communications with members about what
  he said was his own inadequate response when receiving reports of sexual abuse.&#xA0;</p>
  <p>&#x201C;I want to personally apologize for the times I have &#x2018;tuned out&#x2019;
  the muted cry of a wounded, frightened person and left their plea for help unheeded,&#x201D;
  Doland wrote in an April 2023 letter said to have been sent to community members
  in Washington, North Idaho, and Alaska; the letter was reprinted on WINGS For Truth,
  which information about the sect&#x2019;s issues with child sexual assault and reshares
  letters from workers and overseers.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p> <p>&#x201C; I am saddened and
  deeply sorry to know that my responses (or lack thereof) have hindered justice and/or
  healing in some way,&#x201D; Doland&#x2019;s letter continued. &#x201C;I hope you
  will forgive me for this.&#x201D; It followed with concrete steps Doland says leaders
  in the group will now take: &#x201C;Going forward, we will have a zero-tolerance
  policy regarding CSA. If we are made aware of CSA violations involving a victim
  who is presently a minor, we will report it to authorities immediately, in compliance
  with the law.&#x201D;</p> <p>Reached for comment on February 10, Doland would not
  confirm or deny whether he had received a visit from the FBI, but told VICE News
  he&#x2019;s &#x201C;actively addressing&#x201D; abuse allegations in his region
  and committed to helping victims receive help.</p> <p>&#x201C;Thanks for reaching
  out,&#x201D; Doland&#x2019;s email read. &#x201C;I am actively addressing all abuse
  allegations involving participants in this region of our fellowship. My paramount
  concern is that victims receive the professional help that they need.&#xA0; I take
  all allegations of abuse seriously, strongly recommend mandated reporter training
  to all, and encourage everyone to report issues to the proper legal authorities
  as soon as possible. This is my only statement at this time.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>Bruce
  Murdoch, a spokesperson for WINGS For Truth, told VICE News that WINGS is encouraging
  &#x201C;full cooperation&#x201D; from people in leadership positions in the group
  with the FBI investigation.</p> <p>&quot;WINGS would like encourage full cooperation
  for the FBI&apos;s investigation into victims of child sexual abuse stemming from
  the &#x2018;2x2&#x2019; church,&#x201D; Murdoch told VICE News in an email. &#x201C;In
  particular, we encourage those in leadership positions of elders, workers and overseers
  to come forward where you have knowledge of past offenses that were never resolved
  through the proper legal and social channels.&#x201D;</p> <p>Several groups of current
  and former members of the sect have formed to advocate for sexual abuse survivors
  and chart a path forward. Mike and Abbi Prussack and Kyle and Kari Hanks are two
  married couples who all grew up within the sect. They founded and help <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ex2x2/"
  target="_blank">run a large support group on</a> Facebook for ex members, and told
  VICE News in a statement that they&#x2019;d first spoken to the FBI last year.&#xA0;</p>
  <p>&#x201C;After decades of being silenced, survivors are finally having their voices
  heard and amplified,&#x201D; their group statement read. &#x201C;We first spoke
  with the FBI last year when they reached out to us and have continued to help them
  in their investigation while prioritizing survivors who have entrusted us with their
  stories. The FBI is motivated to expose abusers and those complicit within the church,
  especially those in positions of leadership. The investigators are compassionate
  and concerned for survivors. Their goal is to protect future generations of 2x2s.
  We encourage and stand behind survivors who want to reach out to the FBI with their
  stories.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>Another major group is Voices for the Truth, who told
  VICE News that news of the FBI investigation is &#x201C;a significant step forward
  in providing validation and support to countless victim-survivors.&#x201D; The group
  also said that they&#x2019;ve recently partnered with <a href="https://www.rainn.org/"
  target="_blank">RAINN, </a>the national anti-sexual violence organization, to create
  a hotline with specific resources for people who are current and former members
  of the sect. Their full statement reads as follows:&#xA0;</p> <p class="article__blockquote">We
  are grateful that a legal and professional entity is acknowledging both the historical
  and ongoing abuse crisis within the Truth community. This recognition is a significant
  step forward in providing validation and support to countless victim-survivors.
  It is our sincere hope that the FBI&apos;s investigation will be a valuable resource
  and a powerful tool for victim-survivors as they navigate their personal healing
  journeys.&#xA0;</p> <p>We encourage victim-survivors to explore all avenues of support
  available to them and to choose what feels safe and empowering. It is vital that
  victim-survivors and their loved ones have access to psychologically safe and compassionate
  support from professionals who fully understand the unique circumstances of the
  Truth community. That&apos;s why we have partnered with RAINN &#x2014; the nation&apos;s
  largest anti-sexual violence organization and operators of the National Sexual Assault
  Hotline &#x2014; for our Victim-Survivor Support Hotline, which will be launching
  in early March.</p> <p>See more here: <a href="https://voicesforthetruth.org/hotline/"

  2:40 P.M. EST:</b> </p> <p>A spokesperson for the FBI Omaha field office confirmed
  to the investigation to VICE News, but said they were unable to answer further questions
  about its scope or whether other FBI field offices are involved. The statement reads,
  in full: &#x201C;Because the FBI Omaha field office is seeking the public&#x2019;s
  help in identifying potential victims, I can confirm an investigation. &#xA0;In
  order to preserve the integrity and capabilities of the investigation, I cannot
  share any details of the ongoing process.&#x201D; </p> '
