  alt=\"the-shard-london-uk\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Many major global cities saw a significant
  decrease in competitiveness during the COVID-19 pandemic, as governments tightened
  border restrictions and imposed tough social distancing restrictions, according
  to the 2021 Global Power City Index (GPCI).</p><p>It remains to be seen whether,
  in the <a href=\"https://time.com/6051955/work-after-covid-19/\" >post-pandemic
  world of work</a>, <a href=\"https://time.com/collection/worlds-greatest-places-2021/\"
  >these global hubs</a> will retain their ability to attract the highest-caliber
  workers. But, the <a href=\"https://mori-m-foundation.or.jp/english/ius2/gpci2/index.shtml\"
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2021 Global Power City Index</a>&mdash;produced
  by the Mori Memorial Foundation&rsquo;s Institute for Urban Strategies in Tokyo&mdash;found
  most major cities have adapted to work-from-home and hybrid work trends.</p><p>Peter
  Dustan, a researcher at the Institute for Urban Strategies, says that while <a href=\"https://time.com/6108331/business-travel-decline-covid-19/\"
  >international travel is still difficult</a> due to COVID restrictions, many cities
  have begun relaxing social distancing measures, as COVID-19 vaccinations rise. Some
  cities have also begun <a href=\"https://time.com/6084098/employer-vaccine-mandates/\"
  >requiring proof of vaccination</a> to attend large events, eat at restaurants or
  use public transit.</p><p>Dustan thinks this year&#8217;s Power City Index, released
  Wednesday, is useful for comparing how cities have been affected by COVID-19. &ldquo;The
  shape or character of urban attractiveness may shift, but its importance in attracting
  new business and talent will remain,&rdquo; he says.</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><a

  the World&#8217;s Greatest Places of 2021</em></a></p><p>For instance, Hong Kong,
  which has ranked in the top 10 each year for the past seven years, slid to 13th
  place from ninth in 2020. Hong Kong&#8217;s government has among the <a href=\"https://time.com/5872102/hong-kong-coronavirus-social-distancing/\"
  >toughest COVID-19 border restrictions</a> in the world, with up to three weeks
  of mandatory hotel quarantine for travelers. The Asian financial hub also had the
  biggest decline in the number of air passengers, at 88%.</p><p>London continues
  to be the most attractive city, according to the Global Power City Index, but its
  overall score dipped, with the report&#8217;s authors attributing the decline to
  both the pandemic and Brexit, which hampered its economy and global accessibility.
  &ldquo;The fact that all other European cities increased their economy scores suggests
  that the U.K.&rsquo;s exit from the EU is beginning to have an impact, allowing
  other European cities to start catching up to London,&rdquo; the institute said.</p><p>Tokyo
  improved its overall scores, in large part due to <a href=\"https://time.com/6089274/tokyo-olympics-economic-benefits/\"
  >the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics</a> and improvements in work flexibility as Japan

  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">adapts to work from home</a>.</p><p>The
  Global Power City Index evaluates and ranks global cities by their &ldquo;magnetism&rdquo;
  using 70 indicators across six categories: economy, research and development, cultural
  interaction, livability, environment and accessibility.</p><p>In the 48 cities assessed
  this year, the study saw accessibility taking a huge hit; compared to the year before
  the global pandemic began, the frequency of international flights between these
  cities decreased nearly 50%.</p><p>But the Institute for Urban Strategies reported
  some positive changes in the 48 cities despite fewer people moving between them&mdash;more
  than half of them saw an increase in co-working spaces and a decline in working
  hours.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Here are the Global Power City Index&#8217;s
