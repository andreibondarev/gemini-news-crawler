  have entered the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/systems/the-fifth-epoch-of-distributed-computing\">fifth
  epoch of distributed computing</a>, and it promises to revolutionize information
  technology and how we use it. More than a decade of work at Google has been put
  into building AI into our products and solutions, and the shift to generative AI
  represents an industry-wide acknowledgement of its potential.</p><p data-block-key=\"904s9\">Gen
  AI has the potential to tip the balance of security in favor of defenders, and we
  plan on revealing the next steps in the evolution of cybersecurity at Google Cloud
  Next, from April 9-11. <a href=\"https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next?utm_source=cgc-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=FY24-Q2-global-ENDM33-physicalevent-er-next-2024-mc&amp;utm_content=cgc-blog-session-launch-feb&amp;utm_term=-&amp;_ga=2.194274221.-1882690427.1708029791&amp;_gl=1%2anf16ec%2a_ga%2aMTg4MjY5MDQyNy4xNzA4MDI5Nzkx%2a_ga_WH2QY8WWF5%2aMTcwODk2NzA4My4xOC4xLjE3MDg5NjgyODAuMC4wLjA.\"
  target=\"_blank\">Tickets are still available to Next ‘24</a>, where we’ll present
  our vision for the future of cloud — and the vital role that security plays within.</p></div>\n<div

  of chief information security officer has never been an easy one. CISOs are the
  public face of an organization’s security team, and they sit at the nexus of the
  security experts, engineers, and developers who report to them, the organization’s
  security policies, and the executives and board of directors who they report to.
  They often are blamed for security breaches that occur on their watch, and yet CISOs
  are not fleeing their jobs — recent data suggests that, despite the stress of the
  role, they <a href=\"https://ventureinsecurity.net/p/the-great-ciso-resignation-isnt-what\">stay
  at their employer</a> for more than four and a half years at a time.</p><p data-block-key=\"7c5hc\">While
  a CISO who has stayed with one company for five years has clearly demonstrated their
  dedication to defending their organization’s data and supporting its security teams,
  it doesn’t mean that they’re happy. <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-227\">High-profile
  data breaches</a> are on the rise, and government agencies are imposing stricter
  <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-139\">regulatory requirements</a>
  including <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-how-new-sec-rules-can-help-business-leaders\">increasing
  levels of legal accountability</a> (and even personal liability) for their organization’s
  cybersecurity posture.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\"><p
  data-block-key=\"1hrf3\">While I’m not going to spoil the announcements we have
  planned, I do want to give a bit of context for where we were in 2023, and where
  we’re headed.</p><p data-block-key=\"a6dc4\">As Mandiant CEO Kevin Mandia <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-late-april-2023\">said
  last year</a>, “[W]hile we continue to face significant challenges, our industry
  is getting better at cybersecurity and organizations globally have made progress
  in strengthening their defenses. But we cannot let our guard down. We have seen
  that attackers do not rest — and that they are increasingly sophisticated and well-funded.”</p><p
  data-block-key=\"36k5l\">Earlier this month, we <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-security-command-center-enterprise\">introduced
  Security Command Center Enterprise</a>, adding long-awaited multicloud support and
  becoming the first cloud risk management solution that fuses AI-powered SecOps with
  cloud security. It’s designed to help break down the silos of tools, teams, and
  data to ensure faster outcomes and higher efficacy for cloud security and enterprise
  security operations. You don’t need a PhD in cryptography to know that we’re going
  to be talking about this new version of our flagship risk management tool at Next
  ‘24, but there’s a lot more we have to say.</p></div>\n<div class=\"block-pull_quote\"><div

  \       \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\"><p
  data-block-key=\"zp1ti\">Organizations need security partners like Google, who have
  <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/transform/prepare-rsa-cybersecurity-snapshot-numbers\">proven
  expertise, solutions, and extended support</a>. Last year, we set out to create
  a <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/why-we-focus-on-ai-and-to-what-end/\"
  target=\"_blank\">bold and responsible model</a> for how gen AI could benefit cybersecurity
  with a positive impact on the security ecosystem. Our vision for AI in security
  <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/transform/why-ai-can-new-tech-help-security-solve-toil-threat-overload-and-talent-gap\">described
  the possibilities</a>: How we could automate tasks to reduce toil, up-level talent,
  and mitigate threats.</p><p data-block-key=\"57ojd\">Our investments in key technologies,
  including threat intelligence, security operations, and risk management, drove our
  progress towards making strong security simple and accessible. We announced at the
  RSA Conference ‘23 in April our plan to <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/rsa-google-cloud-security-ai-workbench-generative-ai\">supercharge
  security with gen AI</a>, based on foundational AI research by <a href=\"https://ai.google/research/\"
  target=\"_blank\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/research\" target=\"_blank\">DeepMind</a>,
  and the deep expertise of our security teams. We built on that promise, and some
  of our most important announcements revealed our ongoing work towards that goal.</p><p
  data-block-key=\"7jro6\">At Next ‘23 in August, we shared additional <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/security-ai-next23\">AI
  innovations in our security products</a> and also expanded on our holistic approach
  to securing AI. This included the application of the principles of our <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/introducing-googles-secure-ai-framework/\"
  target=\"_blank\">Secure AI Framework</a> (SAIF): We explained why we believe that
  AI needs to be <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/transform/prompt-findings-our-ai-red-teams-first-report-qa\">tested
  by red teams</a>, detailed practical considerations for <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/transform/prompt-what-think-about-when-youre-thinking-about-securing-ai\">securing
  AI</a>, and went deep into the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/transform/from-turnkey-to-custom-tailor-your-ai-risk-governance-to-help-build-confidence\">risk
  governance principles</a> that can help steer AI towards a more beneficial future.</p><p
  data-block-key=\"bqgs6\">We knew that by focusing on building the right foundations,
  we would be able to provide products that prioritize security by design and are
  made to help raise the bar on security. Early user feedback showed that gen AI in
  Security Operations <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/duet-ai-for-developers-and-in-security-operations-now-ga\">helped
  reduce the time</a> that security analysts spent writing, running, and refining
  searches and triaging complex cases by a factor of seven.</p><p data-block-key=\"6k1qp\">Of
  course, there’s a lot more work that our security teams did in the past year that
  I haven’t been able to discuss in depth here that nevertheless plays an important
  role. These topics include the news that we <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/google-cloud-mitigated-largest-ddos-attack-peaking-above-398-million-rps\">stopped
  the largest DDoS attack ever recorded</a> to date, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-google-cloud-blocked-largest-layer-7-ddos-attack-at-46-million-rps\">again</a>;
  that we continue to invest in <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-european-organizations-are-innovating-with-google-sovereign-cloud-solutions\">sovereign
  data and risk management solutions</a>; and that we talked about why we <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-why-ISACs-are-valuable-security-partners\">partner
  with ISACs</a> to improve communication across the community.</p><p data-block-key=\"6luu7\">Google
  Cloud’s technology and expertise ties together a trusted cloud foundation, a modern
  SecOps platform, and frontline intelligence and expertise, all infused with the
  power of gen AI to help drive the security outcomes you’re looking to achieve. I
  hope you’ll join us at Next ‘24 so you can get a front-row seat to see what we’ve
  been planning.</p><p data-block-key=\"4ppbu\">We’re looking forward to seeing you
