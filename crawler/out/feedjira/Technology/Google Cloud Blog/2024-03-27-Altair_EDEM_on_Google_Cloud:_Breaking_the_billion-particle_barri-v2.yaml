summary: "<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align:
  baseline;\">Simulating how bulk and granular materials interact with equipment,
  containers, and one another is a critical capability for industrial, manufacturing,
  and life science organizations. The larger these simulations, the more accurate
  they become, decreasing the time and expense companies must spend iterating designs
  and prototypes. Altair and Google Cloud recently collaborated to see how large a
  simulation they could produce using</span><a href=\"https://altair.com/edem\" rel=\"noopener\"
  target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> </span><span style=\"text-decoration:
  underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Altair® EDEM™</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align:
  baseline;\"> on a single Google Cloud virtual machine. The results were groundbreaking.</span></p>\n<h3><strong
  style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">GPUs power EDEM simulations</strong></h3>\n<p><span
  style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Altair EDEM is a high-performance software application
  for bulk and granular material simulation. Powered by discrete element method (DEM)
  calculations, EDEM quickly and accurately simulates and analyzes the behavior of
  mined ores, soils, fibers, grains, tablets, powders, and more.</span></p>\n<p><span
  style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Over the years, industries have been demanding
  even greater scale from EDEM, resulting in a number of breakthroughs around model
  size. Two decades ago, the upper limit was 200,000 particles — a simulation that
  took upwards of 10 days to create. That quickly rose to one million particles, then
  10 million, then 20 million. The holy grail today is to achieve a simulation containing
  1 billion particles in a few days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align:
  baseline;\">As you might expect, these simulations require a massive degree of computational
  power, so the usage of graphics processing units (GPUs) has greatly improved the
  speed and efficiency of simulations. GPUs are specifically designed to handle parallel
  processing tasks, making them highly efficient for handling the large amounts of
  data and complex calculations involved in EDEM simulations.</span></p>\n<h3><strong
  style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The experiment: Altair EDEM on Google Cloud</strong></h3>\n<p><span
  style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Designed as a desktop application, EDEM has
  always been limited to shared-memory architectures, which exist on a single host.
  This only allows processors to access it directly, as opposed to distributed memory,
  which can scale across multiple hosts. Without extensive rebuilding, EDEM cannot
  take advantage of distributed memory’s scalability and flexibility. However, multi-GPU
  systems offer an opportunity to increase computational power without needing to
  migrate toward distributed memory programming models.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align:
  baseline;\">There were two goals for the collaboration between Altair and Google
  Cloud: simulate the largest system possible, containing one billion particles, and
  gather data to build estimates for mapping a given hardware type to a possible simulation
  scale. In May 2023, Google Cloud announced </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-a3-supercomputers-with-nvidia-h100-gpus\"><span
  style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">the availability
  of its A3 virtual machines (VMs) with NVIDIA H100 GPUs</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align:
  baseline;\">. The A3 VMs combine NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs with modern CPU, as
  well as offering improved host memory and major network upgrades, which made this
  scale of simulation possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Altair
  and Google Cloud ran two simulation scenarios on a single A3 VM with eight NVIDIA
  H100 GPUs, each with 80 GB of GPU memory and a total of 3.6 TB/s bisectional bandwidth.
  The system also included a 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor and 2
  TB of host memory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The
  test scenario chosen was the filling test. This is a practical simulation used to
  check the impact of particle behavior in a realistic industrial setting — in this
  case, particles dropped from a moving plate into a container. Two types of particles
  were used in this simulation: </span><a href=\"https://community.altair.com/community/en?id=community_blog&amp;sys_id=6f14642e1b52dd90507ca6442a4bcbec\"

  style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">As demonstrated above, the combined filing test
  simulation using single- and multi-sphere EDEM simulations achieves a total 1 billion
  particle count, with good scaling across the eight available NVIDIA H100 GPUs.</span></p>\n<p><span
