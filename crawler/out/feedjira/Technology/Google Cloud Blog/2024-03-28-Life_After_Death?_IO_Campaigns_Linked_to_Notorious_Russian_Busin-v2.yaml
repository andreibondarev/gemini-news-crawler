title: Life After Death? IO Campaigns Linked to Notorious Russian Businessman Prigozhin
  Persist After His Political Downfall and Death
url: https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/io-campaigns-russian-prigozhin-persist/
summary: "<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p>Written by: Alden Wahlstrom,
  David Mainor, Daniel Kapellmann Zafra</p>\n<hr/>\n<p> </p></div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p>In
  June 2023, Russian businessman Yevgeniy Prigozhin and his private military company
  (PMC) “Wagner” carried out an armed mutiny within Russia. The events triggered the
  meteoric political downfall of Prigozhin, raising questions about the future of
  his various enterprises that were only underscored when he died two months later
  under <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/4374263-putin-confidant-patrushev-plan-kill-prigozhin/\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>suspicious circumstances</u></a>. Up to that
  point, Prigozhin and his enterprises worked to advance the Kremlin’s interests as
  the manifestation of the thinnest veil of plausible deniability for state-guided
  actions on multiple continents. Such enterprises included the Wagner PMC; overt
  influence infrastructure, like his media company Patriot Group that housed his media
  companies, including the “RIA FAN” Federal News Agency; covert influence infrastructures;
  and an array of <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1581\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>businesses aimed</u></a> at generating personal
  wealth and the resourcing necessary to fund his various ventures.</p>\n<p>Mandiant
  has for years tracked and reported on covert information operations (IO) threat
  activity linked to Prigozhin. His involvement in IO was first widely established
  in the West as part of the <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0126\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>public exposure</u></a> of Russian-backed
  interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election—this included activity conducted
  by Russia’s Internet Research Agency (IRA), which the U.S. Government <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0126\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>publicly named</u></a> Prigozhin as its financier.
  Subsequently, Prigozhin was publicly connected to a web of IO activity targeting
  the U.S., EU, Ukraine, Russian domestic audiences, countries across Africa, and
  further afield. Such activity has worked not only to advance Russian interests on
  matters of strategic importance, but also has attempted to exploit existing divisions
  in societies targeting various subgroups across their population. </p>\n<p>Throughout
  2023, Mandiant has observed shifts in the activity from multiple IO campaigns linked
  to Prigozhin, including continued indicators that components of these campaigns
  have remained viable since his death. This blog post examines a sample of Prigozhin-linked
  IO campaigns to better understand their outcomes thus far and provide an overview
  of what can be expected from these activity sets in the future. This is relevant
  not only because some of the infrastructure of these campaigns remains viable despite
  Prigozhin’s undoing, but also because we advance into a year in which Ukraine continues
  to dominate Russia’s strategic priorities and there are multiple global elections
  that Russia may seek to influence.</p>\n<p>Mandiant and Google's Threat Analysis
  Group (TAG) work together in support of our respective missions at Google. TAG <a
  href=\"https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/ukraine-remains-russias-biggest-cyber-focus-in-2023/\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has likewise been tracking </a>coordinated influence
  operations <a href=\"https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/prigozhin-interests-and-russian-information-operations/\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">linked to Prigozhin</a> and the Internet Research
  Agency (IRA) for years; and in 2023, Google took over 400 enforcement actions to
  disrupt IO campaigns linked to the IRA, details of which are reported in the quarterly <a
  href=\"https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tag-bulletin-q3-2023/\" rel=\"noopener\"
  target=\"_blank\">TAG Bulletin</a>. TAG has not observed significant activity from
  the IRA or other Prigozhin-linked entities specifically on Google platforms since
  Prigozhin's death, which is in line with Mandiant’s findings that have tracked different
  aspects of this broader set of threat activity.</p></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

  \     </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><h2>Prigozhin-linked
  IO Infrastructure Persists Post-Death</h2>\n<p>Mandiant closely tracks multiple
  IO campaigns that have variously been linked to Prigozhin, and we have observed
  shifts in these activity sets over the course of 2023, some of which likely were
  precipitated by Prigozhin’s political downfall and death. We have observed uneven
  degrees of change between campaigns, which may suggest variances in their original
  proximity to Prigozhin’s core operations or other campaign differences, such as
  management models or targeting focus, that have somehow influenced their respective
  degrees of continued viability thus far. However, we lack the visibility to assess
  the reason for this.</p>\n<p>At least some components of these campaigns’ assets
  and infrastructure have remained viable since Prigozhin’s death, and we assess with
  moderate confidence that they will remain operational for the medium-term. These
  components will likely be leveraged by either their original, or appropriating operators,
  to influence public opinion on issues including those related to the Russian invasion
  of Ukraine, U.S. elections and politics, and developments in Africa’s Sahel region. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>We
  conducted an analytical review of three significant Prigozhin-linked IO campaigns
  that we track: the \"Newsroom for American and European Based Citizens\" (NAEBC)
  Campaign, Cyber Front Z, and a campaign linked to the Togo-based <em>Groupe Panafricain
  pour le Commerce et l'Investissement</em> (GPCI). \n<ul>\n<li>The campaigns’ targeting
  aligns with core geographical regions known to be targeted by Prigozhin-linked IO:
  the U.S., Europe, Ukraine, Russia, and countries in Africa. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Following
  the June 2023 mutiny, the swift closure of Prigozhin’s overt influence arms such
  as his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/05/putin-takes-on-yevgeny-prigozhin-business-empire\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Patriot Group</u></a> demonstrated the Russian
  Government’s intent to publicly dismantle at least components of Prigozhin’s operations.
  Reports <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/prigozhin-controlled-russian-media-group-shuts-amid-mutiny-fallout-2023-07-02/\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>also indicated</u></a> that Prigozhin’s “troll
  factory” was likewise closed as a result. \n<ul>\n<li>Given the well-established
  nature of the campaigns detailed in this report, we find it unlikely that they could
  have been overlooked or that formal or informal Russian Government enforcement measures
  would have been incapable of stopping them—specifically as regards to Russia-based
  operations. </li>\n<li>We have traditionally prioritized externally focused Prigozhin-linked
  IO in our tracking and thus lack the visibility to formally assess potential differences
  in outcomes for domestic Russia focused operations. However, it is plausible that
  efforts to dismantle Prigozhin’s influence capabilities may have centered on domestically
  focused operations. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Narratives recently promoted by each
  of these campaigns largely correspond with the campaigns’ established focuses; this
  also includes topical overlaps between campaigns’ promoted narratives on general
  pro-Russia topics and/or narratives that mutually promote Russian interests and
  those of Prigozhin’s foreign business ventures.\n<ul>\n<li>Prigozhin’s businesses
  often served as a mechanism for promoting Russian interests abroad. Also, Prigozhin’s
  business holdings often appeared to concurrently operate in a target region. For
  example, Prigozhin-linked IO activity targeted African nations while his Wagner
  PMC also operated in the region (Figure 2).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul></div>\n<div

  and/or the auxiliary infrastructure leveraged to support them have endured. Additionally,

  managed campaign.</li>\n<li>Cyber Front Z is an overt nominally third-party Russian
  organization established to obfuscate and administer IO activity.</li>\n<li>GPCI
  is an independent, domestically-focused foreign organization with some reported
  financial links to Prigozhin. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Covertly Managed Campaign: NAEBC </h3>\n<p>Since
  October 2020, Mandiant has tracked and reported on the NAEBC IO campaign, which
  has persistently attempted to influence right-leaning U.S. audiences on issues related
  to U.S. politics and elections, as well as significant geopolitical events. The
  campaign is named for the now-inaccessible inauthentic news site \"Newsroom for
  American and European Based Citizens'' (NAEBC), which according to an October 2020 <a
  href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-russia-disinformation/exclusive-russian-operation-masqueraded-as-right-wing-news-site-to-target-u-s-voters-sources-idUSKBN26M5OP/\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Reuters article</u></a> was attributed by
  a U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation investigation as being run by individuals
  linked to the IRA. NAEBC has evolved and shifted its tactics over time. Its operators
  have continued to use established campaign infrastructure after repeated public
  exposure, including the repurposing of social media assets once used to backstop
  and promote the inauthentic NAEBC news site to form the core of an effort to promote
  content furthering the campaign’s objectives through coordinated and inauthentic
  means. </p>\n<p>If leveraged to target upcoming U.S. elections, the NAEBC campaign
  may only be one component of pro-Russia activity collectively targeting the population.
  Historically, IO campaigns linked to Prigozhin and/or the IRA have targeted all
  sides of the political spectrum to advance broader foreign influence objectives
  to sow division. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some previously attributed campaign assets on alternative
  platforms continue to promote content targeting right-leaning U.S. audiences on
  a range of issues.</li>\n<li>The campaign has a history of fluctuating its activity
  levels between key events such as U.S. elections. Its current levels appear to be
  reduced from those during the 2022 U.S. <a href=\"https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/information-operations-2022-midterm-elections\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>midterm elections</u></a>, when the campaign
  had a focused operation, but are similar to what was observed preceding Prigozhin’s
  downfall. </li>\n<li>NAEBC personas recently promoted pro-Russia narratives appear
  consistent with past activity, including narratives targeting U.S. domestic politics
  and elections, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and geopolitical developments, such
  as the Israel-Hamas conflict (Figure 4). </li>\n<li>It is possible that the controversy
  surrounding Prigozhin has affected the campaign; however, given limitations in our
  current visibility and the identified consistencies in recent campaign activity,
  we are currently unable to assess to which degree this may be so.</li>\n<li>NAEBC's
  ongoing activity may be an indicator that the campaign operators intend to leverage
  campaign assets in the upcoming U.S. election season—the campaign has<a href=\"https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/information-operations-2022-midterm-elections\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u> previously mobilized</u></a> around such
  events—even if only as an attempt to bolster the perception that pro-Russia IO is
  persistently influencing the U.S. electorate.\n<ul>\n<li>In the 2022 midterm elections,
  the campaign launched their main operation closer to election day, thus it may be
  too early to assess this scenario. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Historical activity
  linked to Prigozhin and/or the IRA show that their tactics often appear foremost
  intended to exacerbate existing divisions in society, often targeting both sides
  of the political spectrum. Accordingly, we highlight as context an example of related
  IO activity that occurred contemporaneous to NAEBC’s emergence in 2020, which illustrates
  how this dynamic can manifest. \n<ul>\n<li>In August 2020, Mandiant identified and
  reported to customers a website named “Peace Data,” which promoted content that
  appeared curated to influence left-leaning audiences, including some content related
  to U.S. domestic political issues and the then-upcoming 2020 presidential election
  (Figure 5). </li>\n<li>Subsequently, Meta <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/august-2020-cib-report/\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>reported</u></a> publicly in September 2020
  that it had removed a network of coordinated and inauthentic accounts promoting
  Peace Data—it attributed this activity as being run by individuals with links to
  the IRA. Shortly after public exposure, the Peace Data website posted a message
  indicating that it was ceasing operations. </li>\n<li>The Peace Data comparison
  with NAEBC likewise provides an example of how even nominally similar IO campaigns
  can leverage different tactics to target subsets of the same populations. For example,
  Peace Data reportedly engaged in the paid solicitation of unwitting real individuals
  to write articles for dissemination.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

  class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><h3>“Third-Party” Front Organization: Cyber Front
  Z</h3>\n<p>Cyber Front Z first emerged as a Russian-language pro-Russia Telegram
  channel (Russian: Кибер Фронт Z) in the days following Russia’s launch of its full
  scale invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022. We first<a href=\"https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/information-operations-surrounding-ukraine\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u> publicly reported</u></a> on our tracking
  of Cyber Front Z in May 2022, noting its overt efforts to coordinate the promotion
  of invasion-related pro-Russia content and that Russian investigative reporting
  suggested it was linked to individuals from the IRA who were running a troll factory—Meta
  seemingly confirmed this in <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Quarterly-Adversarial-Threat-Report-Q2-2022.pdf\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>public reporting</u></a> from August 2022. </p>\n<p>In
  an August 2023 update to customers following Prigozhin’s death, we identified expansions
  in Cyber Front Z’s activity and several indicators that more clearly established
  Cyber Front Z’s IRA links and suggested the group had plans to expand operations
  leading up to Prigozhin’s mutiny. This activity has been significantly curtailed
  since then, though the Telegram channel has remained somewhat active and limited
  indicators suggest it may still be planning for expanded future activity. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>In
  Spring 2023, Prigozhin announced a new head of Cyber Front Z, a woman named Asiya
  Aminovna Sadrieva who we judge to be a former IRA employee. Prigozhin then directed
  Sadrieva to register Cyber Front Z as a public organization—business records show
  this was done in early June—suggesting plans for Cyber Front Z’s continued activity
  and growth leading up to the mutiny.\n<ul>\n<li>Throughout this time Cyber Front
  Z was posting job solicitations including for \"activists…who are ready to defend
  their Motherland in the information field with the help of comments (VKontakte,
  Telegram)” (translated from Russian) (Figure 6). </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Cyber
  Front Z organized grassroots activity and in-person events, often focused on invasion
  related topics, that appeared to cease post-mutiny. However, in early December 2023,
  the group’s VKontakte (VK) page, where they traditionally promoted events, began
  posting about past events and implying considerations for future organizing (Figure
  7).\n<ul>\n<li>The halting of in-person events indicates that Cyber Front Z was
  at minimum indirectly hampered in some of its activity by Prigozhin’s political
  fallout; its nascent reactivation on this front suggests such effects may not be
  final.</li>\n<li>The grassroots activity organized under the Cyber Front Z brand
  demonstrates how the campaign, which has centered on promoting invasion-related
  messaging, dually maintained an element focused on domestic Russian populations. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Cyber
  Front Z’s Telegram channel has remained operational throughout the process of Prigozhin’s
  undoing and since his death, though it appears less active and is now primarily
  focused on publishing and cross-promoting content related to developments in Ukraine
  and other domestic Russian and global developments.\n<ul>\n<li>Cyber Front Z’s Telegram
  channel continued to promote content supportive of Prigozhin and Wagner throughout
  the insurrection and since.</li>\n<li>A New Year’s Eve post published to both the
  Cyber Front Z Telegram channel and VK page reflected on the group’s 2023 activity,
  including noting that it had organized “raids” on social media pages—likely describing
  what is known as “brigading”— spotlighting its efforts coordinating online activity
  as one of the group’s key accomplishments.</li>\n<li>We currently lack the visibility
  to determine if and/or when the coordinated and inauthentic activity previously
  attributed to the group by Meta ceased. However, this Telegram channel has at least
  previously served as a component of that activity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul></div>\n<div

  Paid Partnership: GPCI</h3>\n<p>In August 2023, before Prigozhin’s death, we identified,
  and subsequently reported to customers, recently registered infrastructure and newly
  created social media accounts that we attributed with high confidence to <em>Groupe
  Panafricain pour le Commerce et l'Investissement</em> (GPCI), a Togo-based political
  marketing consultancy <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/05/metas-adversarial-threat-report-first-quarter-2023/\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>recently outed</u></a> by Meta for its involvement
  in continued information operations targeting domestic audiences primarily in the
  Sahel region of Africa. According to <a href=\"https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/car-takedown-may-2021\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>multiple</u></a> <a href=\"https://alleyesonwagner.org/2023/02/05/burkina-faso-under-influence/\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>sources</u></a>, GPCI and its founder Harouna
  Douamba allegedly maintain ties to the now-deceased Yevgeniy Prigozhin.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The
  identified websites, which we assessed to be inauthentic, present as media entities
  targeting different countries in Africa’s Sahel region. Additionally, we identified
  a number of Facebook pages and accounts leveraged to seed and disseminate content—some
  pages correspond directly to media outlets attributed to GPCI. \n<ul>\n<li>Facebook
  pages published content and then regularly shared that content across different
  Facebook groups. </li>\n<li>Additionally, the suspected inauthentic Facebook accounts,
  which most commonly presented as regionally based individuals, inorganically boosted
  engagement with the GPCI-associated Facebook pages (Figure 8). </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Messaging
  promoted by this network has included narratives related to political dynamics and
  events within the Sahel region, such as criticizing France’s regional presence.</li>\n<li>According
  to <a href=\"https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/23-00039724#:~:text=May%202023%2C%20Meta-,acknowledged,-renewed%20attempts%20by\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>public reporting</u></a> by Meta, GPCI is
  linked to Aimons Notre Afrique (ANA), a non-governmental organization (NGO) based
  in the Central African Republic (CAR) that has previously been exposed for supporting
  information operations. Notably, separate <a href=\"https://alleyesonwagner.org/2023/02/05/burkina-faso-under-influence/\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>public reporting</u></a> has indicated that
  GPCI/ANA, as well as its founder Harouna Douamba, maintain various ties to Prigozhin.
  These links include alleged financial connections to a company called Lobaye Invest,
  which the <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1133\" rel=\"noopener\"
  target=\"_blank\"><u>U.S. Department of Treasury</u></a> previously sanctioned as
  controlled by Prigozhin and used to consolidate PMC Wagner’s operations in the Central
  African Republic; and claims that Douamba managed Russian propaganda out of the
  “Office of Information and Communication in the Central African Republic,” <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/le-monde-africa/article/2023/08/06/the-faces-of-russia-s-influence-across-the-african-continent_6082513_124.html\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a center of influence established by Wagner
  within the Central African presidency</u></a>.</li>\n<li>GPCI exhibited an upward
  trend in its activity throughout the period of Prigozhin’s downfall and subsequent
  death, during a time when some other Prigozhin-linked IO activity sets appeared
  to be at least hampered by the political fallout surrounding him. One possible explanation
  for this is that GPCI represents a third model for how Prigozhin managed his IO
  activity. \n<ul>\n<li>In addition to being located outside Russia, and thus potentially
  beyond the reach and care of the Russian Government, GPCI is an organization local
  to the target region under local management. It is possible that GPCI has conducted
  influence activity in the pay of Prigozhin-linked entities and also is engaged in
  separate activity reflecting local initiatives that in instances also has alignments
  with Russian interests.</li>\n<li>We lack the visibility that would confirm this
  possible dynamic. However, if true, such a paid-local partnership model could explain
  the resurgence of GPCI activity during this tumultuous period. Likewise, its purported
  history of partnering with Prigozhin would suggest that it could be leveraged by
  surviving Prigozhin legacy organizations or other Russian actors in future.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul></div>\n<div

  class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><h2>Promoted Messaging</h2>\n<p>The NAEBC, Cyber
  Front Z, and GPCI campaigns’ recently promoted narratives largely appear to be consistent
  with past activity. Each campaign has a distinct regional focus that directly corresponds
  with the majority of its promoted content. However, the campaigns have also promoted
  messaging targeting other countries or issues, including issues relevant to Russian
  strategic interests and/or Prigozhin’s diverse business investments. What follows
  are some examples of narratives promoted by these campaigns organized by some of
  the regions they have variously targeted. </p>\n<h3>The U.S. and Europe</h3>\n<p>NAEBC’s
  central narrative focus remains related to U.S. politics and elections. This includes
  narratives promoting issues that appear aligned with the Republican Party, specifically
  supporting former U.S. President Donald Trump and criticizing the current administration
  and the Democratic Party (Figure 9).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promoted content has supported
  Trump’s candidacy in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, and it has questioned
  the 2020 U.S. presidential election results.</li>\n<li>Other narratives promoted
  controversial narratives, such as alleging that the congressional committee established
  to investigate the events of Jan. 6 was engaged in a cover-up, or promoting narratives
  related to allegations against President Biden's son Hunter.</li>\n<li>Narratives
  that appeared to criticize the Administration include those that framed Biden as
  unfit for leadership and those that implied he and other officials are corrupt and
  ignore the problems facing the American people.</li>\n<li>In some instances, NAEBC
  promoted content more broadly criticizing major institutions, such as NATO or the
  UN, suggesting they should be dismantled. Such narratives appear to generally support
  an idea that a Western-led global order should be broken up in favor of a multipolar
  world where Russia has a larger share of influence.</li>\n</ul></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

  content published to the Cyber Front Z Telegram channel regularly criticizes “the
  West” and individual Western countries.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Often this is in the context
  of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, though Western countries also are targeted on
  unrelated issues. This includes content that is critical of U.S. and European leaders. </li>\n<li>Additional
  narratives critique what are labeled as “Western values,” including the repeated
  promotion of anti-LGBTQ+ content. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Ukraine and Russia</h3>\n<p>Cyber
  Front Z’s core focus remains the promotion of pro-Russia content related to the
  Russian invasion of Ukraine, though it does comment on other topics (Figure 10).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promoted
  narratives support the Russian war effort, including explicit support for Wagner;
  they also include anti-Ukraine messaging, criticizing Ukraine’s war effort and leadership,
  as well as disinformation narratives and pro-Russia talking points like falsely
  calling Ukrainians “nazis” and the war a process of “denazification.” </li>\n<li>Additional

  praised and supported Captain Ibrahim Traoré (the military leader and transitional
  president of Burkina Faso) and the role of Burkina Faso's Defense and Security Forces
  (FDS) and the Patriotic Movement for Safeguard and Restoration (MPSR).</li>\n<li>Some
  narratives praised strengthened Russo-Burkinabe relations, such as touting Traoré's

  supporting Wagner’s role in several African countries, including content presenting
  Wagner as important to regional security and defending Russia's interests abroad.</p>\n<h2>Outlook
  and Implications</h2>\n<p>Throughout his long tenure as a funder of IO activity,
  Yevgeniy Prigozhin and his affiliated entities not only established a range of campaigns
  targeting different geographies but also leveraged multiple models for managing
  and executing IO as is exemplified by the case studies detailed in this blog post.
  We currently lack the visibility necessary to assess the total implications of what
  the differences between Prigozhin-linked IO campaigns may mean for their long-term
  survivability. Key indicators that we are looking for moving forward include those
  that might shed light on their future management: indicators suggesting a central
  connection between any surviving campaigns, or those suggesting that the various
  Prigozhin-linked activity sets are linked to different actors and thus they have
  been fragmented under new operators. While the outcome of this process remains unknown,
  analysis of these three campaigns highlights the potential that this and potentially
  other IO infrastructure established by Prigozhin-linked initiatives will remain
  available for pro-Russia threat activity at least in the medium term.</p></div>"
