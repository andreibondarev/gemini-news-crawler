title: Take control of GKE scaling with new quota monitoring
url: https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gke-gets-new-quota-monitoring-feature/
summary: "<div class=\"block-paragraph\"><p data-block-key=\"be2h4\">Managing the
  growth of your Kubernetes clusters within Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) just got
  easier. We've recently introduced the ability to directly monitor and set alerts
  for crucial scalability limits, providing you with deeper insight and control over
  your Kubernetes environment.</p><p data-block-key=\"2d322\">Effective scalability
  management is essential for avoiding outages and optimizing resource usage in Kubernetes.
  These new monitoring features bring you:</p><ul><li data-block-key=\"16b1c\"><b>Peace
  of mind</b>: Potential capacity issues can be proactively addressed before they
  cause problems, ensuring uninterrupted operations.</li><li data-block-key=\"asb61\"><b>Clearer
  understanding</b>: Gain a deeper insight into your clustersâ€™ architectural constraints,
  allowing for informed decision-making.</li><li data-block-key=\"9t69g\"><b>Optimization
  opportunities</b>: Analyze usage trends and identify ways to fine-tune your cluster
  configurations for optimal resource utilization.</li></ul><p data-block-key=\"5r9lq\">Here
  are the specific limits you can now keep track of:</p><ul><li data-block-key=\"4bk99\"><b>Etcd
  database size (GiB)</b>: Understand how much space your Kubernetes cluster state
  is consuming.</li><li data-block-key=\"3j7ek\"><b>Nodes per cluster</b>: Get proactive
  alerts on your cluster's overall node capacity.</li><li data-block-key=\"9jr79\"><b>Nodes
  per node pool (all zones)</b>: Manage node distribution and limits across specific
  node pools.</li><li data-block-key=\"ba8jk\"><b>Pods per cluster (GKE Standard /
  GKE Autopilot)</b>: Ensure you have the pod capacity to support your applications.</li><li
  data-block-key=\"976cu\"><b>Containers per cluster (GKE Standard / GKE Autopilot)</b>:
  Prevent issues by understanding the maximum number of containers your cluster can
  support.</li></ul></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n

  data-block-key=\"be2h4\"><b>Get started</b></h3><p data-block-key=\"5jgrd\">You'll
  find these new quota monitoring and alerting features directly within the Google
  Cloud console. To get there, you can use the <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas?service=container.googleapis.com\">link</a>
  to a pre-filtered list of GKE quotas or navigate to the Quotas page under the IAM
  &amp; Admin section in the console and then filter by the Kubernetes Engine API
  service. To search for a specific quota, use the Filter table. You can filter by
  the exact quota name, location, cluster name, or node pool (where applicable). You
  can also create alerts for a specific quota by following the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/monitor#quota_alerts\">guide</a>.
  Alerts can be configured to notify you when a quota is approaching or has exceeded
  its limit.</p><p data-block-key=\"8p41a\">By using the Cloud Monitoring API and
  console you can monitor GKE quota usage in greater depth. The API allows you to
  programmatically access quota metrics and create custom dashboards and alerts. The
  console provides a graphical interface for monitoring quota usage and creating alerts.
  Custom dashboards can be created to visualize quota usage over time. Alerts can
  be configured to notify you when quota usage reaches a certain threshold. This can
  help you proactively manage your quotas and avoid unexpected outages. See the <a
  href=\"https://cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/monitor#cloud-monitoring\">guide</a>
  for more details.</p><p data-block-key=\"86heg\">Need more information? Explore
