  vertical-align: baseline;\"> Stanford University Assistant Professor Paul Nuyujukian
  and his team at the Brain Inferencing Laboratory explore motor systems neuroscience
  and neuroengineering applications as part of an effort to create brain-machine interfaces
  for medical conditions such as stroke and epilepsy. This blog explores how the team
  is using Google Cloud data storage, computing and analytics capabilities to streamline
  the collection, processing, and sharing of that scientific data, for the betterment
  of science and to adhere to funding agency regulations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align:
  baseline;\">Scientific discovery, now more than ever, depends on large quantities
  of high-quality data and sophisticated analyses performed on those data. In turn,
  the ability to reliably capture and store data from experiments and process them
  in a scalable and secure fashion is becoming increasingly important for researchers.
  Furthermore, collaboration and peer-review are critical components of the processes
  aimed at making discoveries accessible and useful across a broad range of audiences. </span></p>\n<p><span

  The raw experimental data collected in these experiments is extremely valuable and

  style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Google Cloud provides a secure, scalable, and
  highly interoperable framework for the various analyses that need to be run on the
  data collected from scientific experiments (spanning basic science and clinical
  studies). </span><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/\" rel=\"noopener\"

  Pipelines</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> specify the transformations
  and analyses that need to be applied to the various datasets. GitLab Runner instances
  running on GKE (or other on-premises cluster/high-performance computing environments)
  are used to execute these pipelines in a scalable and cost-effective manner. Autopilot
  environments in particular provide substantial advantages to researchers since they
  are fully managed and require only minimal customization or ongoing “manual” maintenance.
  Furthermore, they instantly scale with the demand for analyses that need to be run,
  even with </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/spot-vms\"><span
  style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">spot VM pricing</span></a><span
  style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, allowing for cost-effective computation. Then,
  they scale down to near-zero when idle, and scale up as demand increases again –
  all without intervention by the researcher.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align:
  baseline;\">GitLab pipelines have a clear and well-organized structure defined in
  YAML files. Data transformations are often multi-stage and GitLab’s framework explicitly
  supports such an approach. Defaults can be set for an entire pipeline, such as the
  various data transformation stages, and can be overwritten for particular stages
  where necessary. Since the exact steps of a data transformation pipeline can be
  context- or case-dependent, conditional logic is supported along with dynamic definition
  of pipelines, e.g., definitions depending on the outcome of previous analysis steps.
  Critically, different stages of a GitLab pipeline can be executed by different runners,
  facilitating the execution of pipelines across heterogeneous environments, for example
  transferring data from experimental acquisition systems and processing them in cloud
  or on-premises computing spaces [Fig. 3].</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

  style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Cloud computing resources can provide exceptional
  scalability, while pipelines allow for parallel execution of stages to take advantage
  of this scalability, allowing researchers to execute transformations at scale and
  substantially speed up data processing and analysis. Parametrization of pipelines
  allows researchers to automate the validation of processing protocols across many
  acquired datasets or analytical variations, yielding robust, reproducible, and sustainable
  data analysis workflows.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Collaboration
  and data sharing is another critical, and now mandatory, aspect of scientific discovery.
  Multiple generations of researchers, from the same lab or different labs, may interact
  with particular datasets and analysis workflows over a long period of time. Standardized
  pipelines like the ones described above can play a central role in providing transparency
  on how data is collected and how it is processed, since they are essentially self-documenting.
  That, in turn, allows for scalable and repeatable discovery. Data provenance, for
  example, is explicitly supported by this framework. Through the extensive use of
  containers, workflows are also well encapsulated and no longer depend on specifically
  tuned local computing environments. This consequently leads to increased rigor,
  reproducibility and transparency, enabling a large audience to interact productively
  with datasets and data transformation workflows.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align:
  baseline;\">In conclusion, by using the computing, data storage, and transformation
  technologies available from Google Cloud along with workflow capabilities of CI/CD
  engines like GitLab, researchers can build highly capable and cost-effective scientific
  data-analysis environments that aid efforts to increase rigor, reproducibility,
  and transparency, while also achieving compliance with relevant government regulations.</span></p>\n<p><span
