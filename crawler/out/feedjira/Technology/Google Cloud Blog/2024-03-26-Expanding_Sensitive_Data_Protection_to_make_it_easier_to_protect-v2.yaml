title: Expanding Sensitive Data Protection to make it easier to protect data in Cloud
  SQL

summary: "<div class=\"block-paragraph\"><p data-block-key=\"adc74\">Organizations
  rely on data-driven insights to power their business, but unlocking the full potential
  of data comes with the responsibility to handle it securely. This can be a significant
  challenge when data growth can easily outpace the ability to manually inspect it,
  and data sprawl can lead to sensitive data appearing in unexpected places.</p><p
  data-block-key=\"6rkhs\">Google Cloud’s <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/security/products/sensitive-data-protection?hl=en\">Sensitive
  Data Protection</a> can help you balance innovation with security, privacy, and
  compliance. The accompanying <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/data-profiles\">Discovery
  Service</a> can empower many Google Cloud customers to identify where sensitive
  data resides, and manage risk to that data.</p><p data-block-key=\"eo0gq\">We are
  excited to announce that the Discovery Service now supports <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/sql?hl=en\">Cloud
  SQL</a> in addition to BigQuery and BigLake. Cloud SQL is Google Cloud’s enterprise-ready,
  fully-managed database service for running MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server workloads.</p><p
  data-block-key=\"6198b\">Databases are at the heart of business applications and
  they store user data, financial data, and other business critical data. Databases
  are also an important part of innovations. For example, Cloud SQL has become a crucial
  part of gen AI applications with its support for <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/announcing-vector-support-in-postgresql-services-to-power-ai-enabled-applications\">vector
  search</a> and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/build-rag-applications-with-langchain-and-google-cloud\">LangChain
  integration</a> to enable <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/rag-with-databases-on-google-cloud\">Retrieval
  Augmented Generation</a> (RAG) use cases. This makes it even more critical to ensure
  you have visibility into the sensitive data in your databases.</p><p data-block-key=\"a73kg\">Continuous
  visibility of where your sensitive data is stored and processed can help inform
  your organization’s data security, privacy, and governance operations. When you
  enable discovery, Sensitive Data Protection scans and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/data-profiles#scan-frequency\">automatically
  profiles</a> your existing and new resources. Discovery can also automatically rescan
  data based on key events like a schema change or on a regular schedule.</p></div>\n<div

  data-block-key=\"adc74\"><b>Monitoring your data footprint</b></h3><p data-block-key=\"c7d0v\">You
  can run discovery at the organization, folder, or project level to generate data
  profiles of your Cloud SQL and BigQuery tables. This enables you to get a bird’s-eye
  view of your data assets and quickly identify any unexpected findings such as highly
  sensitive data in a new geographic location or with the wrong exposure controls.
  From here you can drill down to specific projects, databases, tables, and columns
  or customize views and filters to fit your needs.</p></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

  a service, Sensitive Data Protection acts as a source of truth about your data assets
  and can automatically report metrics for audit reports and generate alert events.
  It is deeply integrated into <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/security/products/security-command-center\">Security
  Command Center Enterprise</a>, our multicloud security and risk management solution.
  Security Command Center’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL8nB5GHbd0\"

  misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in your databases, and simulate real-world
  attack scenarios.</p><p data-block-key=\"2hft3\">With rich insights for each CloudSQL
  table and column, you can effectively manage risk and safeguard the data that drives
  your business, analytics, and AI workloads.</p><p data-block-key=\"b083e\">To get
