  <div class="block-paragraph_advanced"><p><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Combined data from Google’s </span><a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">Threat Analysis Group (TAG)</span></a><span style="vertical-align: baseline;"> and Mandiant shows 97 zero-day vulnerabilities were exploited in 2023; a big increase over the 62 zero-day vulnerabilities identified in 2022, but still less than 2021's peak of 106 zero-days.</span></p>
  <p><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">This finding comes from the </span><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/documents/Year_in_Review_of_ZeroDays.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">first-ever joint zero-day report by TAG and Mandiant</span></a><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">. The report highlights 2023 zero-day trends, with focus on two main categories of vulnerabilities. The first is end user platforms and products such as mobile devices, operating systems, browsers, and other applications. The second is enterprise-focused technologies such as security software and appliances.</span></p>
  <p><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Key zero-day findings from the report include:</span></p>
  <ul>
  <li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: disc; vertical-align: baseline;">
  <p role="presentation"><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Vendors' security investments are working, making certain attacks harder.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: disc; vertical-align: baseline;">
  <p role="presentation"><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Attacks increasingly target third-party components, affecting multiple products.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: disc; vertical-align: baseline;">
  <p role="presentation"><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Enterprise targeting is rising, with more focus on security software and appliances.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: disc; vertical-align: baseline;">
  <p role="presentation"><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Commercial surveillance vendors lead browser and mobile device exploits.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: disc; vertical-align: baseline;">
  <p role="presentation"><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">People’s Republic of China (PRC) remains the top state-backed exploiter of zero-days.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: disc; vertical-align: baseline;">
  <p role="presentation"><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Financially-motivated attacks proportionally decreased.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Threat actors are increasingly leveraging zero-days, often for the purposes of evasion and persistence, and we don’t expect this activity to decrease anytime soon. Progress is being made on all fronts, but zero-day vulnerabilities remain a major threat. </span></p>
  <h2><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">A Look Back — 2023 Zero-Day Activity at a Glance</span></h2>
  <h3><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Barracuda ESG: CVE-2023-2868</span></h3>
  <p><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Barracuda disclosed in May 2023 that a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-2868) in their Email Security Gateway (ESG) had been actively exploited since as early as October 2022. Mandiant investigated and determined that UNC4841, a suspected Chinese cyber espionage actor, was conducting attacks across multiple regions and sectors as part of an espionage campaign in support of the PRC.</span></p>
  <p><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Mandiant released a blog post with </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/barracuda-esg-exploited-globally"><span style="text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">findings from the initial investigation</span></a><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">, a follow-up post with </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc4841-post-barracuda-zero-day-remediation"><span style="text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">more details as the investigation continued</span></a><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">, and a </span><a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/barracuda-esg-rpt-en.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">hardening guide</span></a><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">. Barracuda also released a </span><a href="https://www.barracuda.com/company/legal/esg-vulnerability" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">detailed advisory with recommendations</span></a><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">.</span></p>
  <h3><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">VMware ESXi: CVE-2023-20867</span></h3>
  <p><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Mandiant discovered that UNC3886, a Chinese cyber espionage group, had been exploiting a VMware zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-20867) in a continued effort to evade security solutions and remain undiscovered. The investigation shined a big light on UNC3886's deep understanding and technical knowledge of ESXi, vCenter and VMware’s virtualization platform.</span></p>
  <p><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Mandiant released a blog post detailing </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/vmware-esxi-zero-day-bypass"><span style="text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">UNC3886 activity involving exploitation of this zero-day vulnerability</span></a><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">, and also </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/vmware-detection-containment-hardening"><span style="text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">detection, containment and hardening opportunities</span></a><span style="vertical-align: baseline;"> to better defend against the threat. VMware also released an </span><a href="https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2023-0013.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">advisory with recommendations</span></a><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">.</span></p>
  <h3><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">MOVEit Transfer: CVE-2023-34362</span></h3>
  <p><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Mandiant observed a critical zero-day vulnerability in Progress Software's MOVEit Transfer file transfer software (CVE-2023-34362) being actively exploited for data theft since as early as May 27, 2023. Mandiant initially attributed the activity to UNC4857, which was later merged into FIN11 based on targeting, infrastructure, certificate and data leak site overlaps.</span></p>
  <p><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Mandiant released a blog post with </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/zero-day-moveit-data-theft"><span style="text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">details on the activity</span></a><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">, as well as a </span><a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/moveit-containment-hardening-guide-rpt-en.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">containment and hardening guide</span></a><span style="vertical-align: baseline;"> to help protect against the threat. Progress released an </span><a href="https://community.progress.com/s/article/MOVEit-Transfer-Critical-Vulnerability-31May2023" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">advisory with details and recommendations</span></a><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">.</span></p>
  <h2><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Takeaways</span></h2>
  <p><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Zero-day exploitation has the potential to be high impact and widespread, as evidenced by the three examples shared in this post.</span></p>
  <p><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Vendors must continue investing in security to reduce risk for their users and customers, and organizations across all industry verticals must remain vigilant. Zero-day attacks that get through defenses can result in significant financial losses, reputational damage, data theft, and more. </span></p>
  <p><span style="vertical-align: baseline;">While zero-day threats are difficult to defend against, a defense in depth approach to security can help reduce potential impact. Organizations should focus on sound security principles such as vulnerability management, network segmentation, least privilege, and attack surface reduction. Additionally, defenders should conduct proactive threat hunting, and follow guidance and recommendations provided by security organizations.</span></p>
