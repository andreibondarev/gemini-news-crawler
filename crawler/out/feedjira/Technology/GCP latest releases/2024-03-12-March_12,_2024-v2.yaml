  class=\"release-note-product-title\">Vertex AI Search and Conversation</strong>\n<h3>Announcement</h3>\n<p><strong>Vertex
  AI Search: Vertex AI Search for healthcare (GA)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Vertex AI Search
  for healthcare is Generally available (GA).  Healthcare search lets you query healthcare
  records stored in FHIR data stores.  For more information, see <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/introduction#es-and-personalize\">Vertex
  AI Search</a>. With healthcare search, you can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-data-store-hc\">Create
  a healthcare search data store and import FHIR R4 data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-app-hc\">Create
  a healthcare search app</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/search-hc-data\">Search
  healthcare data using keywords and natural language queries</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/search-hc-data#nl-search-genAI\">Search
  healthcare data using natural language queries with generative AI answers</a> (Private
  preview)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p><strong>Vertex AI Search: Specify a parser
  for unstructured content (Public preview)</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can control how
  documents are parsed when they are uploaded to Vertex AI Search. Parser specification
  is available in Public preview.</p>\n\n<p>Vertex AI Search provides a digital parser
  (GA), an OCR parser for PDFs (Public preview), and a layout parser (Public Preview). During
  data store creation for generic search apps with unstructured data, you can set
  a default parser for the data store and an override parser for specific file types.</p>\n\n<p>For
  more information, see <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/parse-chunk-documents#parsing\">Parse
  documents</a>. </p>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p><strong>Vertex AI Search: Turn on document
  chunking (Public preview)</strong></p>\n\n<p>To use Vertex AI Search for retrieval-augmented
  generation (RAG) for LLMs, you can turn on document chunking when creating a data
  store. Document chunking is available in Public preview.</p>\n\n<p>When document
  chunking is turned on, your documents are split into chunks when you ingest documents
  into your data store, and your search app can return chunks of data in search results
  instead of full documents. Using chunked data for RAG increases relevance for LLM
  answers and reduces computational load for LLMs. Document chunking is in Public
  preview. For more information, see <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/parse-chunk-documents#parse-chunk-rag\">Chunk
  documents for RAG</a>. </p>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p><strong>Vertex AI Search: Connect
  ServiceNow as a data source (Private preview)</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can connect
  ServiceNow as a third-party data source for Vertex AI Search. For more information,
  see <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/connect-third-party-data-source\">Connect
  a third-party data source</a>.</p>\n\n    "
