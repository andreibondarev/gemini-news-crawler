content: "<strong class=\"release-note-product-title\">Chronicle</strong>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Fixed
  an issue that prevents you from using the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/reference/param-measure-types#list\">list</a>,
  <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/reference/param-measure-types#percentile\">percentile</a>,
  and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/reference/param-measure-types#percentile_distinct\">percentile_distinct</a>
  functions when you create a custom measure in your dashboard.</p>\n<strong class=\"release-note-product-title\">Chronicle
  SOAR</strong>\n<h3>Announcement</h3>\n<p>Remote Agents Release 1.4.9 is currently
  in Preview.</p>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<p>The Docker image to pull for this release
  is 1.4.9.2</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Upgrade agents from 1.3.8 on RHEL not working
  as expected (ID #00243884)</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Publisher memory usage issue
  (ID #00273756)</p>\n<strong class=\"release-note-product-title\">Compute Engine</strong>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p><strong>Preview</strong>:
  With managed workload identities for Compute Engine, you can implement mutually
  authenticated and encrypted communications between any two Compute Engine VMs. Workload
  applications running on the configured VMs can use the X.509 credentials for per-VM
  mTLS. These mTLS certificates are automatically rotated and managed for you by Certificate
  Authority Service.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/authenticate-workloads-over-mtls\">Authenticate
  workloads to other workloads over mTLS</a>.</p>\n<strong class=\"release-note-product-title\">Contact
  Center AI Platform</strong>\n<h3>Announcement</h3>\n<p><strong>Version 3.11 is released</strong></p>\n\n<p>All
  release notes published on this date are part of version 3.11.</p>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p><strong>Cold
  chat transfer</strong></p>\n\n<p>Agents can do a &quot;cold transfer&quot; for a
  chat. With a cold chat transfer, the agent assigns a chat session to a new agent
  or a queue, and then immediately leaves the chat without waiting for the new agent
  to join. This helps agents efficiently transfer chats without being bound to them.
  For more information, see <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/contact-center/ccai-platform/docs/Transfer_for_Chat\">Transfer
  a Chat</a>.</p>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p><strong>Support for partial response in Dialogflow</strong></p>\n\n<p>CCAI
  Platform supports the partial response option in Dialogflow. This is particularly
  useful when the virtual agent needs to call a webhook that will likely take a while
  to run. With partial response enabled, Dialogflow can immediately send an initial
  fulfillment message to the end-user, such as, &quot;One moment while I look that
  up.&quot; This way, while the webhook runs and the final fulfillment message is
  generated, the end-user expects a short wait instead of assuming that there is a
  problem. For information about configuring this capability in Dialogflow,  see <a
  href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/fulfillment#partial-response\">Partial
  response for streaming API</a>.</p>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p>Added new response fields
  for indicating agent availability to the <code>manager/api/v1/agents/current_status</code>
  and <code>apps/api/v1/wait_times</code> APIs. These indicate the number of assigned
  agents, logged-in agents, available agents, and breakthrough agents.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Fixed
  an issue that prevented copying an IVR menu structure.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Fixed
  an issue where the automatic redirect to a PSTN number used a direct PSTN dial instead
  of the configured BYOC SIP dial settings.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Fixed an issue
  where the account ID in search results did not refresh after removing search input.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Fixed
  an issue preventing the editing of user permissions for Microsoft Teams users.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Updated
  virtual task assistants to support an unlimited number of data parameters.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Fixed
  an issue where the Contact Name displayed &#39;Chat User&#39; instead of the end-user&#39;s
  name.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Fixed an issue where the <strong>Agent</strong> and
  <strong>Supervisor</strong> filters on the <strong>Agents</strong> page displayed
  as <strong>All undefined</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Fixed an issue where
  the file name was not visible when the user held the pointer over the compose-email
  pane.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Fixed the error message that displays when an administrator
  disables an email queue with an invalid IMAP connection.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Fixed
