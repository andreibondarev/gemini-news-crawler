content: "<strong class=\"release-note-product-title\">Access Approval</strong>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p>Access
  Approval supports Google Distributed Cloud Edge in the GA stage.</p>\n<strong class=\"release-note-product-title\">AlloyDB
  for PostgreSQL</strong>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/omni/backup-overview\">Back
  up and restore AlloyDB Omni</a> documentation is updated to include pgBackRest,
  an open-source solution included with the AlloyDB Omni Docker container.</p>\n<strong
  class=\"release-note-product-title\">Anthos Service Mesh</strong>\n<h3>Announcement</h3>\n<p>The
  rollout of managed Anthos Service Mesh version 1.17 to the stable channel <strong>has
  completed</strong>.</p>\n<strong class=\"release-note-product-title\">Anti Money
  Laundering AI</strong>\n<h3>Announcement</h3>\n<p>Improved the party de-registration
  process. You can now remove parties without prediction intent (that is, those parties
  not included in a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/financial-services/anti-money-laundering/docs/create-and-manage-prediction-results\">create
  prediction results request</a>) within a 45-day window following registration.</p>\n<strong
  class=\"release-note-product-title\">Artifact Registry</strong>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p>Artifact
  Registry remote repositories support basic authentication to user-defined and preset
  upstream sources for Docker, Maven, npm, and Python formats.</p>\n\n<p>To create
  a remote repository using a preset or user-defined upstream source, see <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/repositories/remote-repo\">Create
  remote repositories</a>. For more information on remote repository authentication,
  see <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/repositories/configure-remote-authentication\">Configure
  authentication to remote repositories</a>.</p>\n<h3>Issue</h3>\n<p>Images copied
  to Artifact Registry from Container Registry with the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/transition/auto-migrate-gcr-ar\">automatic
  migration\ntool</a> are failing to propagate their upload time to Artifact Registry,
  and instead have their upload time value set to zero, resulting in an upload time
  of early 1970. If you have cleanup policies that delete images based on upload time,
  this might mean all your copied images are deleted. We are actively working on a
  fix for this issue. </p>\n<strong class=\"release-note-product-title\">Carbon Footprint</strong>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<p>Emissions
  reported for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) declined starting in February 2024.
  This change is a result of an update to Google&#39;s internal cost allocation, which
  determines how shared infrastructure costs are attributed to individual services.
  According to our methodology (<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/carbon-footprint/docs/methodology#details-electricity\">Technical
  details - Electricity use</a>), these internal costs are used to apportion electricity
  consumption and carbon emissions to services, so changes in cost apportionment result
  in corresponding changes to carbon apportionment and reporting for that service.</p>\n<strong
  class=\"release-note-product-title\">Chronicle</strong>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p>Chronicle
  has expanded <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/detection/cloud-threats-category\">Cloud

  Actions Service</a>, and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/custom-modules-etd-overview\">Custom
  modules for Event Threat Detection</a> are identified. These detections are available
  through the following rule sets: CDIR SCC Cloud IDS, CDIR SCC Cloud Armor, CDIR
  SCC Impact, CDIR SCC Enhanced Persistence, CDIR SCC Enhanced Defense Evasion, and
  CDIR SCC Custom Module.</p>\n<strong class=\"release-note-product-title\">Chronicle
