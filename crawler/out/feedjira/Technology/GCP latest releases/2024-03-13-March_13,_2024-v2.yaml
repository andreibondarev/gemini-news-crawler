  Looker (original) deployment start: <strong>Monday, March 18, 2024</strong></p>\n\n<p>Expected
  Looker (original) final deployment and download available: <strong>Thursday, March
  28, 2024</strong></p>\n\n<p>Expected Looker (Google Cloud core) deployment start:
  <strong>Monday, March 18, 2024</strong></p>\n\n<p>Expected Looker (Google Cloud
  core) final deployment: <strong>Monday, April 1, 2024</strong></p>\n<h3>Breaking</h3>\n<p>Query
  IDs can no longer be used to <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/reference/looker-api/latest/methods/Query/query\">fetch
  queries</a> or <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/reference/looker-api/latest/methods/RenderTask/create_query_render_task\">create
  render tasks</a> through the API. The <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/reference/looker-api/latest/methods/Query/all_running_queries\">Get
  All Running Queries</a> API endpoint is now restricted to admins only. Query slugs
  that are generated by Looker will be 32 characters instead of 7.</p>\n<h3>Breaking</h3>\n<p>Chrome
  is starting to <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/privacy-sandbox-tracking-protection/\">deprecate
  third-party cookies</a> as of January 2024. Because of Looker&#39;s dependency on
  third-party cookies to establish <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/signed-embedding\">embed</a>
  user sessions, this may impact your embed use case. For more information, see the
  <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/best-practices/chrome-third-party-cookie-deprecation\">Chrome
  is deprecating third-party cookies</a> notice.</p>\n<h3>Breaking</h3>\n<p>Previously,
  custom visualizations would not call the <code>updateAsync</code> function after
  the vis config is updated via the custom visualization API. Now, the function will
  be called. If a custom visualization is set up to update the vis config every time
  <code>updateAsync</code> is called, it could cause excessive refreshes.</p>\n\n<p>If
  your custom visualization is fails to load after this update, double check your
  custom visualization code for unnecessary vis config updates. If you have a Looker
  (original) instance, you can also enable the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/admin-panel-general-labs#custom_vis_reliable_render\">Custom
  Vis Reliable Render</a> Labs feature which causes Looker to suppress excess refresh
  behavior in custom visualizations.</p>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p>The Performant Field
  Picker feature is now generally available.</p>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p>When an instance
  has no projects, Looker will more prominently prompt users to create a model.</p>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p>In
  the Create a model wizard, your selections are now saved even if you close steps
  without having completed the model creation process.</p>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p>Adding
  a query slug to source queries in the merge query API response <code>GET merge_queries/&lt;merge_query_id&gt;</code>
  returns the query slug in addition to the ID.</p>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p>The <code>save_content</code>
  permission now has two child permissions, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/admin-panel-users-roles#save_dashboards\">save_dashboards</a>
  and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/admin-panel-users-roles#save_looks\">save_looks</a>.
  These permissions let Looker admins exert finer control over the kinds of content
  that users can save.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Only users who have access to dashboard
  extensions will be shown the Add Extension tile.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Subtotals
  have been fixed for queries with <code>order_by_field</code> references in query
  streaming pathways. This feature now performs as expected.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>An
  issue where embed secrets might have been visible to non-admin users has been fixed.
  This feature now performs as expected.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Looker now ignores
  all blank filter strings, including <code>IS NOT</code>.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>An
  issue has been fixed that caused small decimals to be displayed in scientific notation
  even when formatting was disabled. This feature now performs as expected.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>An
  issue has been fixed where the PDT Context Override toggle was improperly reflecting
  the ON state when it had been cleared prior. This feature now performs as expected.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Performant
  field picker sorting behavior has been fixed. This feature now performs as expected.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Downloading
  results from SQL Runner now only downloads the file and does not open the file in
  a new browser tab.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Filter expressions including user attributes
  and OR logical conditions were being incorrectly populated when generating SQL.
  This feature now performs as expected.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>A change in the Snowflake
  dialect was ported to Kotlin to maintain parity. Snowflake column names with mixed
  cases are now properly quoted.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Filter suggestion requests
  have been reduced while the user is typing. Because normal typing will invoke fewer
  requests, the load on the server will be reduced.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>An issue
  that caused single value change indicators to not render in Safari when dashboards
  scrolled has been fixed. This feature now performs as expected.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>The
  LookML Validator no longer hangs on a connection that references a deleted or malformed
  user attribute. The Validator also surfaces a detailed error when the user tests
  the connection.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>An issue has been fixed where extension
  documents would appear when hiding Looker document links was disabled. This feature
  now performs as expected.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Content Validator has added support
  for field replacement within custom measure filters (across Looks, dashboard elements,
  and merge queries).</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Queries with <code>order_by_field</code>
  references and subtotals should render correctly in downloads / <code>run_query</code>
  APIs.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Looker should now correctly handle cases where the
  sorts query had an empty string or was entirely empty.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Previously,
  the All Results option was unavailable for schedules on Looks. This feature now
  performs as expected.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>On the new Admin - Users page, Looker
  Support users were shown as having never logged in even for currently logged-in
  users. This issue has been fixed and this feature now performs as expected.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>LookML-defined
  fields that are used in field filters will not be rejected from a set when the field
  requiring them is rejected from that set. This feature now performs as expected.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Previously,
  the Errors and  Broken Content dashboard appeared twice in the admin panel. This
  feature now performs as expected.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>A data validation message
  is now returned for waterfall charts when there are multiple measures and a hidden
  dimension.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Looker now shows a clearer warning message when
  a user attempts to download a query with <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/reference/param-field-allow-fill#definition\">dimension
  fill</a> and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/downloading#all_results\">All
  Results</a> enabled.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Looker no longer imposes the Explore
  row limit of 5,000 on queries that are run using the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/reference/looker-api/latest/methods/Query/run_inline_query\">run
  inline query</a>  API endpoint.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Previously, the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/reference/looker-api/latest/methods/LookmlModel/lookml_model_explore\">lookml_model_explore</a>
  API endpoint would return a 500 error in certain cases. This feature now performs
  as expected.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Errors about UI downloads are now more descriptive,
  similar to descriptive API error messages.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Internal encryption
  has been migrated from  AES-128 to AES-GCM-256 encryption.</p>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p>The
  Disallow Numeric Query IDs <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/legacy-feature-schedule\">legacy
  feature</a> has been added to let users opt in to or out of query API changes.</p>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p>The
  <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/admin-panel-general-labs#advanced_features_for_new_schedules_page\">Advanced
  Features for New Schedules Page</a> Labs feature is now available. This lets you
  sort and filter the list of scheduled plans on the Admin - Schedules page.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Previously,
  when a dashboard was scheduled using <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/best-practices/rendered-format-options-downloading-delivering-dashboards#pngs\">PNG
  format</a> and one of the tiles contained an empty <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/editing-user-defined-dashboards#adding_a_tile_note\">note</a>,
  the schedule would fail. This feature now works as expected.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>The
  Export function has been re-enabled, which lets Looker admins export data from a
  Looker (original) instance for import into a Looker (Google Cloud core) instance.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Incorrect
  quoting in Snowflake views has been fixed.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>IAM checks for
  ephemeral users were disabled as a result of rendering issues for users who were
  logged in with SAML in Looker (Google Cloud core).</p>\n<strong class=\"release-note-product-title\">Resource
  Manager</strong>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p>You can add tags at the time of creating
  folders and projects. These tags can be added as key-value pairs. For more information,
  see <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders#add_tags_during_folder_creation\">Add
  tags during folder creation</a> and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#add_tags_during_project_creation\">Add
  tags during project creation</a>. This feature is currently in preview. </p>\n<strong
  class=\"release-note-product-title\">Storage Transfer Service</strong>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p>Support
  for transfers from cloud and on-premises Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) sources
  is now generally available (<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages\">GA</a>).
  </p>\n\n<p>HDFS support allows for use cases such as migrating from on-premises
  storage to Cloud Storage, archiving data to free up on-premises storage space, replicating
  data to Google Cloud for business continuity, or transferring data to Google Cloud
  for analysis and processing.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/create-transfers/agent-based/hdfs\">Transfer
  from HDFS to Cloud Storage</a> for details.</p>\n\n    "
