content: "<strong class=\"release-note-product-title\">Chronicle SOAR</strong>\n<h3>Announcement</h3>\n<p>Release
  6.2.49 is now in General Availability. </p>\n<strong class=\"release-note-product-title\">Dataflow</strong>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<p>Streaming
  jobs created after March 7, 2024 automatically encrypt all user data with <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/customer-managed-encryption-keys\">customer-managed
  encryption keys (CMEK)</a>. To enable this encryption for jobs created before March
  7, 2024, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/stopping-a-pipeline\">drain
  or cancel the job</a>, and then restart it.</p>\n<strong class=\"release-note-product-title\">Dataproc
  Metastore</strong>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p>Dataproc Metastore now supports <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-metastore/docs/backup-metadata\">scheduled
  backups</a>. Backups can be scheduled to run at user-specified cron job intervals,
  including running daily, weekly, or monthly. </p>\n<strong class=\"release-note-product-title\">Google
  Kubernetes Engine</strong>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>For GKE versions later than 1.29.1-gke.1760000,
  the NEG, Ingress, L4 internal load balancer with <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/service-load-balancer#subsetting\">subsetting</a>,
  and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/external-svc-lb-rbs#backend_service-based\">L4
  RBS controllers</a> will skip processing the nodes missing the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/gke-zonal-topology#zonal-placement-methods\"><code>topology.kubernetes.io/zone</code></a>
  label until the zone information is ready. The load balancer controllers will no
  longer block sync operations when a node is introduced without the label.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>Managed
  ASM installation and node scaling fails on GKE Autopilot clusters on versions between
  1.28.6-gke.1095000 and 1.28.7-gke.1025000 and on versions between 1.29.1-gke.1016000
  and 1.29.1-gke.1781000. To mitigate this issue, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-upgrades-autopilot#manual-upgrade\">upgrade
  the cluster</a> to version 1.28.7-gke.1026000 or later, or 1.29.2-gke.1060000 or
  later.</p>\n\n<p>With 2024-R07, clusters created in the Rapid channel are defaulting
  to an affected version. To avoid creating a cluster on an affected version, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-an-autopilot-cluster#set-version\">manually
  specify</a> version 1.28.7-gke.1026000 or later, or 1.29.2-gke.1060000 or later
  when creating clusters in the Rapid channel.</p>\n<strong class=\"release-note-product-title\">Recommender</strong>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p><a
  href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/home/recommendations\">Recommendation Hub</a>
  is a centralized page on Google Cloud that helps you view all of your recommendations
  in one place. We recently made improvements to the page, including enabling organization
  and folder-view of recommendations, custom sorting and filtering of recommendations,
  and more. For more information, see <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/recommender/docs/quickstart-recommendation-hub\">documentation</a></p>\n<strong
  class=\"release-note-product-title\">Vertex AI</strong>\n<h3>Feature</h3>\n<p><strong>Vertex
  AI Feature Store</strong></p>\n\n<p>The following features of Vertex AI Feature
  Store are now available in <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages\">Preview</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Integration
  of Vertex AI Feature Store with Dataplex:</strong>  Online store instances, feature
  views, and feature groups are now automatically registered as data assets in Data
  Catalog, a Dataplex feature that catalogs metadata from these resources. You can
  use the metadata search capability of Dataplex to search for and view the metadata
  of these resources. For more information, see <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/search-feature-metadata\">Search
  for resource metadata in Data Catalog</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>**Service account configuration
  for feature views: **You can configure a feature view to use a dedicated service
  account. By default, every feature view uses the service account configured for
  your project. For more information, see <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/create-featureview#serviceaccount\">Configure
  the service account for a feature view</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Multiple entity
  IDs for a feature view:</strong> While creating or updating a feature view, you
  can specify multiple entity ID columns. For more information, see <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/create-featureview#create_featureview_bq_embedding\">Create
  a feature view</a>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n    "
