  alt=\"Pet of the Year\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<p>&#8220;In the end, I&#8217;ve got antibodies
  and a dog named Fauci.&#8221;</p><p>That&#8217;s how Los Angeles-based lawyer Kari
  Milone says she&#8217;s choosing to look back on the eight months that she spent
  trying to adopt a rescue dog in 2020&mdash;a time period during which she not only
  lost her second dog in less than a year, but also survived COVID-19.</p><p>Named
  after <a href=\"https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2020/5888309/anthony-fauci/\"
  >Dr. Anthony Fauci</a> because &#8220;he has a white coat and was abandoned during
  COVID,&#8221; Fauci the dog is one of approximately <a href=\"https://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics\"
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3.2 million</a>
  shelter animals that the <a href=\"https://secure.aspca.org/donate/ps-gn-20201111-p2?ms=MP_PMK_Googlebrand-T4&amp;initialms=MP_PMK_Googlebrand-T4&amp;pcode=WPSE9XXGOGN2PK00014&amp;lpcode=WPSE9XXGOGN1PK00014&amp;test&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;ds_rl=1066461&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA7939BRBMEiwA-hX5J-QZYeg9xm7krJ1i1scg9LxIfhzFBB7tlFqeHhajjiSfYRdItIWy7RoCSx4QAvD_BwE\"
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">American Society
  for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)</a> estimates is adopted each year.
  This year, demand for animal adoption is skyrocketing: as stay-at-home orders were
  issued across the U.S. in March in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the ASPCA
  shared that according to industry data from <a href=\"https://www.petpoint.com/Portals/Petpoint/pdfs/reportdata/COVID19/COVIDReport-Week2.pdf\"
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PetPoint</a>,
  animal welfare organizations across the country saw a spike in adoptions during
  the second half of March, with an estimated national adoption rate of 58% at the
  beginning of the month, jumping to 85% by the end of the month.</p>\n[time-brightcove
  not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"
  src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Fauci.jpeg?quality=85&#038;w=560\"
  alt=\"Fauci\"/>\n\t\t\t<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen an incredibly compassionate response
  from people willing to open their homes to foster and adopt vulnerable shelter animals
  during this period of uncertainty and applaud them for stepping up so heroically
  for animals in need,&rdquo; says ASPCA President and CEO Matt Bershadker. &#8220;This
  unprecedented compassionate response from communities across the country to support
  their local shelters reflects widespread appreciation of the invaluable role pets
  play in our lives.&rdquo;</p><p>Despite fears that stay-at-home orders would result
  in shelters being inundated with animals due to an increase in abandoned pets, officials
  from rescue organizations like <a href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cacc.html\"
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chicago Animal Care and Control
  (C</a><a href=\"https://spcala.com\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ACC)</a>
  and the <a href=\"https://spcala.com\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Society
  for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Los Angeles (spcaLA)</a> say the opposite
  has been true.</p><p>&#8220;When stay-at-home orders were set into motion, we were
  anxious about the possibility of seeing an increase in intake requests and a decrease
  in transfers and adoptions,&#8221; says CACC Public Information Officer Jennifer
  Schlueter. &#8220;We were so pleased to experience the exact opposite of what we
  first feared&#8230;The demand for foster and adoptive animals coupled with a decrease
  in intake led us to be down to around 30 animals for a while in the late spring
  and early summer.&#8221;</p><p>In Los Angeles, spcaLA President Madeline Bernstein
  says the shelter is adopting pets out as fast as they come in. &#8220;This is true
  across the country,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The animal shelters have been emptied
  of adoptable animals through either adoptions or fosters, because of what a good
  time it is, when families are home together during lockdown, to work with a new
  pet. And it&#8217;s also a hedge against loneliness.&#8221;</p><p>It&#8217;s a trend
  that doesn&#8217;t surprise longtime pet owners like Caitlin McCarthy, who understands
  firsthand <a href=\"https://time.com/5817622/foster-pets-coronavirus/\" >how comforting
  animals can be,</a> especially in times of stress or isolation. After her dog, a
  Westie named Oscar, passed away in September, McCarthy, a teacher for Worcester
  Public Schools in Massachusetts, says she wasn&#8217;t able to last long without
  a fur baby.</p><p>&#8220;This pandemic has been a very isolating situation,&#8221;
  she says. &#8220;I was grateful to have the time with Oscar because his health had
  started to fail when the schools shut down, so I was able to be with him. But after
  he passed away, I really noticed not having him in the house because he was a member
  of the family. I&#8217;m working from home. I&rsquo;m not going out. I really missed
  having a dog.&#8221;</p><p>So when she saw that <a href=\"https://www.nnewestierescue.org\"
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Northern New England Westie
  Rescue Inc.</a> had shared some photos on Facebook of a few dogs who were up for
  adoption, she jumped at the opportunity. &#8220;I immediately sent them a message,&#8221;
  she says. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t even something I thought about. I just did it.
  Because I knew. I saw the little faces and I knew one of them had to be mine.&#8221;</p><p>About
  a week later, McCarthy was meeting a volunteer driver in the parking lot of an Olive
  Garden to pick up Finbarr, a 10-year-old Westie who had been rescued from a Kansas
  &#8220;puppy mill.&#8221; As soon as she held him, she says she knew they had a
  connection.</p><p>&#8220;I had gravitated toward the photo of him that [the rescue]
  had posted on Facebook. There was just something very soulful about his eyes. So
  I told them I&#8217;d be happy with any dog, but if I could meet him, I think he&#8217;s
  the dog for me,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I went to pick him up and they opened up
  the back of the car and there he was. I was so excited and he was shy, as you can
  imagine. But as soon as I picked him up, he licked me right on the cheek. It&rsquo;s
  like he knew, like he was saying, &#8216;You&#8217;re gonna be my girl, aren&rsquo;t
  you?&#8217; And the answer was yes.&#8221;</p>\n\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"
  src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Finbarr.jpg?quality=85&#038;w=560\"
  alt=\"Finbarr before and after\"/>\n\t\t\t<p>Since arriving at his new home on Oct.
  26, Finbarr (a name that McCarthy says she chose because her late mother loved it)
  has blossomed before McCarthy&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;He was used as a puppy mill breeder
  for 10 years. His whole life was in a cage. He didn&#8217;t know what a toy was.
  He had never had a name. He had never been outside to play. So I&#8217;m teaching
  him all those things,&#8221; she says. &#8220;And it&#8217;s very healing for me
  too. He&#8217;s like furry evidence of hope during a very troubling time. When you
  see a dog that&#8217;s survived the most horrific circumstances and he keeps getting
  better and better every day, how can you not feel hopeful about life in the future?&#8221;</p><p>The
  emotional support that pets can offer their owners is more crucial than ever in
  this moment, says Rachael Silverman, a psychologist specializing in couple and family
  psychology who often prescribes emotional support animals for patients. &#8220;With
  so much uncertainty and instability, animals provide people, especially children,
  with unconditional love, support, and comfort as well as serve as a distraction,&#8221;
  she says. &#8220;I had one 8-year-old patient who told me how she shared her adopted
  cat with her grandmother so her grandmother would have a piece of her with her and
  wouldn&rsquo;t feel lonely because she couldn&rsquo;t visit her.&#8221;</p><p>Staying
  at home amid the pandemic has also spurred many first-time pet owners to take the
  rescue plunge, and in doing so, discover how much emotional heavy lifting animals
  can be capable of doing. Since adopting their dog Nana, a 6-year-old boxer mix,
  from <a href=\"http://www.badassbrooklynanimalrescue.com\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"
  target=\"_blank\">Badass Brooklyn Animal Rescue</a> in April, Crystal Kayiza and
  Peter Quandt have come to learn that she has an uncanny knack for lifting spirits.</p><p>&#8220;She&#8217;s
  such a joy to have and is really attuned to how people are feeling. I think everyone
  says this about their dog, but she&#8217;s definitely acutely aware of when someone&#8217;s
  having a bad day,&#8221; Kayiza says. &#8220;She&#8217;s really low energy and just
  wants to cuddle up with people and hang out. I think what&#8217;s been needed a
  lot during this time is being able to take a break from staring at screens and just
  sit on the floor with my dog for a bit.&#8221;</p>\n\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\"
  class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-3.24.43-PM.png?w=560\"
  alt=\"Crystal Kayiza's dog Nana\"/>\n\t\t\t<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not just dogs
  providing these much-needed moments of levity. When Elise Healy and her partner
  realized that they wouldn&#8217;t be able to take a trip to France that they had
  planned for March to celebrate finishing grad school, they decided to adopt a new
  cat instead. They ended up rescuing Poe, a black domestic short hair from <a href=\"https://www.seattleareafelinerescue.org\"
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Seattle Area Feline Rescue</a>,
  who, along with their other cat Keaton, has helped them cope with spending the year
  at home.</p><p>&#8220;[Poe&#8217;s] crazy. He likes to be chased around the house
  and to play and will randomly jump into our laps and hang out with us. He falls
  off of his cat tower, often. I don&#8217;t think I can adequately explain how wild
  and hilarious he is,&#8221; Healy says. &#8220;It breaks up the day to be sitting
  at your desk working and bored and then, you know, suddenly have a box moving around
  the house because he&rsquo;s gotten into it and can&#8217;t get out.&#8221;</p>\n\t\t\t<img
  decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-23-at-9.29.43-AM.png?w=560\"
  alt=\"Poe\"/>\n\t\t\t<p>2021 looks to be a big year for shelter pets, too: In January,
  a shelter dog will take up residence in the White House for the first time ever
  when <a href=\"https://time.com/5907674/joe-biden-wins-2020-election/\" >President-elect
  Joe Biden</a> moves in with his dog Major, a German shepherd who the Bidens adopted
  in 2018 from the <a href=\"https://delawarehumane.org\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"
  target=\"_blank\">Delaware Humane Association (DHA)</a>. It will be a landmark day
  for supporters of <a href=\"https://time.com/5490401/california-rescue-animals-law/\"
  >&#8220;adopt, don&#8217;t shop,&#8221;</a> a growing movement that encourages people
  to adopt pets from shelters and rescue groups instead of purchasing them from commercial
  breeders.</p><p>&#8220;Our staff and our volunteers are super excited about Major
  going to the White House mainly because it highlights the important work we do of
  finding great homes for dogs and cats. It&#8217;s like, if one of our DHA adoptees
  is good enough for the White House, it&#8217;s good enough for your home, right?&#8221;
  says DHA Executive Director Patrick Carroll. &#8220;And it&#8217;s not just DHA.
  It&#8217;s highlighting adoption for all the shelters in Delaware and throughout
  the country. I think having a shelter dog go to the White House is really going
  to help with that awareness.&#8221;</p><p>That Major and the Bidens&#8217; other
  dog, Champ, are headed to the White House will also mark the return of the time-honored
  tradition of presidential pets. &#8220;Americans are majority pet owners,&#8221;
  says Andrew Hager, Historian-in-Residence of the <a href=\"http://www.presidentialpetmuseum.com\"
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Presidential Pet Museum</a>.
  &#8220;We kind of expect that from our presidents and we&#8217;ve gotten that for
  the most part because the presidents come from the American people and that&#8217;s
  part of our culture.&#8221;</p><p>The Bidens are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/28/us/Biden-cat-dogs-German-shepherd.html\"
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly</a> planning on
  bringing a cat along, too. Perhaps they, like so many other Americans, have been
  bitten by the pet adoption bug. Milone, for one, says that even though it&#8217;s
  only been a few weeks since Fauci came home, his presence has already made one thing
  clear to her: despite the challenges she faced the first time around, she wants
  to rescue another dog&mdash;and soon. &#8220;The only thing that I&#8217;ve become
  absolutely certain about is that I will get another rescue,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I
  need a month to get good with [Fauci], so that he and I know each other really well.
  Then I&#8217;ll get a second one.&#8221;</p>"
