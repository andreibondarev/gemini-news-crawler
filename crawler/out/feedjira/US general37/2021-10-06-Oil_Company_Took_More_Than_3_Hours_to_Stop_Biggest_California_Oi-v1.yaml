  Corp. took more than three hours to halt California&rsquo;s worst oil spill in almost
  three decades, according to a government report.</p><p>Following a low-pressure
  alarm around 2:30 a.m. on Oct. 2 from its San Pedro Bay Pipeline, Amplify&rsquo;s
  Beta Offshore unit didn&rsquo;t shut the pipeline down until 6:01 a.m., the U.S.
  Department of Transportation&rsquo;s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
  <a href=\"https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/2021-10/Beta%20Offshore%20CAO.10.04.2021.pdf\"
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in a
  corrective action order Tuesday.</p><p>The company didn&rsquo;t return messages
  seeking comment.</p><p>While all the details aren&rsquo;t known, &ldquo;the facts
  that are stated are very concerning to us,&rdquo; said Bill Caram, executive director
  of Pipeline Safety Trust, a group that engages with pipeline operators. Operational
  reasons can cause a pipeline to lose pressure suddenly, but &ldquo;we would have
  expected a pipeline to shut a line much faster than three hours&rdquo; and also
  report it more quickly, he said.</p><p>The Golden State&rsquo;s largest oil leak
  since a 1994 earthquake split open a pipeline spilled as much as 3,000 barrels along
  the California coast, according to Amplify&rsquo;s estimates. The oil has drifted
  southward, forced the closure of popular surfing beaches and sullied wetlands.</p><p>Divers
  have found a 13-inch split in the pipeline that was &ldquo;the likely source of
  the release of the oil,&rdquo; said U.S. Coast Guard spokesperson Rebecca Ore at
  a briefing on Tuesday. About 4,000 feet of the pipeline was &ldquo;laterally displaced
  by 105 feet.&rdquo;</p><p>Amplify CEO Martyn Willsher said at the briefing that
  footage showed the pipeline was &ldquo;pulled like a bowstring.&rdquo; That type
  of dislocation is &ldquo;not common,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>He said his company
  didn&rsquo;t confirm the leak until about 8 a.m. that morning, when an oil sheen
  on nearby waters was identified.</p><p>&ldquo;Regardless of the cause, we&rsquo;re
  going to do everything we can to make things right,&rdquo; Willsher said.</p><p>After
  shutting the pipeline, Beta didn&rsquo;t report the incident to the National Response
  Center for another three hours, according to the report. Initial estimates indicated
  that the pipeline released about 700 barrels, much less than the company&rsquo;s
  number.</p><p>Beta Offshore was ordered to review and assess the effectiveness of
  its emergency response plan, including &ldquo;the on-scene response and support,
  coordination, notification, and communication with emergency responders and public
  officials,&rdquo; according to the document. PHMSA didn&rsquo;t specify if the time
  taken to shut the line and notify the National Response Center was too slow or adequate.</p><p>An
  email and call to PHMSA regarding the appropriateness of the three hour wait wasn&rsquo;t
  immediately returned.</p><p>The root cause of the accident remains unconfirmed but
  &ldquo;preliminary reports indicate that the failure may have been caused by an
  anchor that hooked the pipeline, causing a partial tear,&rdquo; according to the
  order. There&rsquo;s no confirmation on a ship causing the leak.</p><p><em>&#8211;With
