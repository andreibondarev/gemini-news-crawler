  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> owner Dan Gilbert recently
  expressed belief Donovan Mitchell will sign a contract extension with the team. </p><p>"We’ve
  been talking to him, sure, for the last couple of years about extending this contract,"
  Gilbert said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. "We think he will
  extend. I think if you listen to him talk, he loves the city.</p><p>However, Mitchell,
  who signed a five-year contract with the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/utah-jazz"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Utah Jazz</a> in 2020, took a more measured approach
  when he responded to Gilbert's comments. </p><p>"I got a lot of things to focus
  on outside of that right now to be honest," Mitchell told reporters Saturday. "I
  gotta focus on myself, getting back [from his knee injury] for this group, focusing
  on us getting over this stretch, continuing to be ready when it comes time."</p><p><a

  target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>VIEW MOMENT ON X</strong></a></p><p>Mitchell's
  response probably stems from the NBA guard's desire to keep his options open. The
  27-year-old is having another standout season, averaging 27.1 points and a career-best
  6.1 assists per game.</p><p>Cleveland acquired him in a blockbuster trade shortly
  before the 2022-23 season. The team viewed him as perhaps the final piece to contend
  for an NBA championship with young stars Darius Garland, Evan Mobley and Jarrett
  Allen.</p><p>Injuries have limited Mitchell to 49 games this season. Friday's game
  against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/philadelphia-76ers"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philadelphia 76ers</a> marked Mitchell's first since
  March 16. He finished with 12 points in 32 minutes.</p><p><i>The Associated Press
