  representing "samples of the most beautiful extraterrestrial substance yet discovered."
  The meteorite is "celebrated for its striking resemblance to Edvard Munch''s ‘The
  Scream,’" said a joint release from the jetport and MMGM. </p><p>"We are thrilled
  to have ‘Fly Me to the Moon’ at the Jetport," said Paul Bradbury, director of the
  airport. "We love celebrating unique aspects of Maine, and the MMGM is certainly
  among them." </p><p>Darryl Pitt, a music executive from New York City who sourced
  all the meteorites, said he "loved" the Portland International Jetport, and thought
  it was an excellent location to "provide a peek at MMGM''s treasures." </p><p><a
