content: "\n<p>I spent most of today in an onsite offsite meeting, and it was great
  seeing some colleagues I don&#8217;t get to hang out with all the time. In between
  sessions, I got some good reading in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[blog] <strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure-modernization/google-named-a-leader-in-the-forrester-wave-ai-infrastructure-solutions-q1-2024/\">Google
  named a Leader in The Forrester Wave: AI Infrastructure Solutions, Q1 2024</a></strong>.
  I also read the underlying report this morning, and there&#8217;s an impressive
  set of vendors in this space right now. While we&#8217;re tops, it&#8217;s a reminder
  that you should be &#8220;buying&#8221; expertise and agility, not hardware right
  now. The landscape and use cases are still emerging!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[article] <strong><a

  (in)efficient are engineering organizations?</a></strong> Here&#8217;s a quick look

  You Have to Make a Strategic Decision Without Much Data</a></strong>. Sometimes
  (often?) you don&#8217;t have the data available that could help you make a confident
  decision. This article talks about three ways to set a course forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[blog]

  announces the beta release of ambient mode</a></strong>. Service meshes are starting
  to get a little simpler, and a proxy-less architecture will be popular in the years
  ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[article] <strong><a href=\"https://www.ciodive.com/news/generative-ai-tech-debt-complexity-gartner/710486/\">Early
  generative AI adopters at higher risk of tech debt</a></strong>. It&#8217;s guaranteed
  that something you&#8217;re doing with generative AI today will be obsolete in a
  year. That&#8217;s the nature of fast-evolving technology. But that work isn&#8217;t
  in vain, as this article points out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[blog] <strong><a href=\"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/8-years-later-a-world-go-champions-reflections-on-alphago/\">8
  years later: A world Go champion’s reflections on AlphaGo</a></strong>. I remember
  this was a big deal when it happened. Here, we revisit the &#8220;win&#8221; by

  analytics with Spark procedures in BigQuery, now generally available</a></strong>.
  BigQuery is such a fascinating, unified platform for analytics. So many things in
  a single place, accessible through SQL queries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[blog] <strong><a
  href=\"https://spin.atomicobject.com/concurrency-go/\">Leverage Go’s Concurrency:
  Transforming API Data Fetching with Goroutines and Channels</a></strong>. This is
  a complex language feature, but powerful. And I&#8217;d probably learn it by asking
  generative AI to produce some code on my behalf.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[article] <strong><a
