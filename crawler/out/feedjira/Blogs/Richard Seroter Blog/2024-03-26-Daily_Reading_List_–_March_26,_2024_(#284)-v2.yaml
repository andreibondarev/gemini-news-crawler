content: "\n<p>Today&#8217;s reading list seemed to be skewed towards &#8220;struggles.&#8221;
  Struggles with career progression, scaling AI programs, software supply chain risks,
  upgrading core infrastructure, or even doing test-driven development right. The
  struggle is real, but all you can do is find your next right step, and get access
  to those who can help you make it through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[article] <strong><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2024/03/4-experiments-to-encourage-employees-career-progress\">4
  Experiments to Encourage Employees’ Career Progress</a></strong>. Getting promoted
  isn&#8217;t the way we should measure career progression. There are lots of ways
  to advance professionally, and this article explores a few ways to think about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[article]

  the Seams in Mainframes for Incremental Modernisation</a></strong>. This is the
  type of architecture work I can geek out over. It&#8217;s real forensics into a
  legacy system and finding seams that help you start incremental modernization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[blog]
  <strong><a href=\"https://testing.googleblog.com/2024/03/whats-in-name.html\">What’s
  in a Name?</a></strong> Here&#8217;s a good little post with very useful advice
  on naming things in your codebase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[blog] <strong><a href=\"https://medium.com/google-cloud/llm-finops-cost-optimization-options-to-run-high-performance-ai-ml-workloads-on-gke-in-google-96f79d79c51b\">LLM&amp;FinOps:
  Cost Optimization Options to Run High Performance AI/ML Workloads on GKE in Google
  Cloud</a></strong>. It wasn&#8217;t cheap for cloud providers to buy all this AI-ready
  hardware, and it&#8217;s not necessarily cheap for you to use it. But you can manage
  costs if you come into it prepared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[article] <strong><a href=\"https://www.ciodive.com/news/accenture-ai-investments-billions-data-modernization/711132/\">Accenture
  sees companies struggling to scale AI</a></strong>. I found a few interesting nuggets
  here. Big firms (cloud vendors, consulting shops) have invested in AI ahead of revenues.
  But the client projects are now coming. And modernization is table stakes to take
  advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[article] <strong><a href=\"https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/interview/google-cloud-ciso-contrasts-shared-fate-vs-shared-responsibility-models/2024/03/\">Google

  <strong><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/why-isnt-the-world-upgrading-its-databases/\">Why
  Isn’t the World Upgrading Its Databases?</a></strong> From what I&#8217;ve observed,
  most companies don&#8217;t upgrade their infrastructure—databases, operating systems,
  business apps, commercial software, programming languages—until there&#8217;s a
  forcing function. If it just works, even if it&#8217;s out of mainstream support,
  it&#8217;ll keep running until something requires a change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[blog]
