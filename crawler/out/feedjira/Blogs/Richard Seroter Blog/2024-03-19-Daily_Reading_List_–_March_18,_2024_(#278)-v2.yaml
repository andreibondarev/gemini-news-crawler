content: "\n<p>I&#8217;m in Sunnyvale today and had some terrific meetings. Probably
  because I just finished reading <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3wU6xFw\">Death by
  Meeting</a></em> and am focused on making my meetings more engaging and impactful.
  It&#8217;s a quick read, and I highly recommend it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[article] <strong><a

  methods for measuring GenAI adoption and impact</a></strong>. This is good for answering
  the &#8220;how&#8221;, assuming you&#8217;ve answered the &#8220;what&#8221; and
  &#8220;why&#8221; already. Use telemetry, experience sampling, and surveys to collect
  data to answer your questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[blog] <strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/gemini-pro-available-in-bigquery-through-vertex-ai/\">Dive

  Years of Incidents at Six Different Companies: How a Culture of Resilience Can Help
  You Accomplish Your Goals</a></strong>. Really good talk from Vanessa that educates
  us on incidents, how to respond effectively, and some anti-patterns to avoid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[blog]
  <strong><a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2024/03/google-io-2024-save-the-date.html\">Tune
  in for Google I/O on May 14</a></strong>. Might be worth marking your calendar for

  Thursday’s flight, Starship is already the most revolutionary rocket ever built</a></strong>.
  There are times where it can feel like human civilization doesn&#8217;t create amazing
  physical things any more, and then I get inspired by pieces like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[article]

  evolution of play: From live to living games</a></strong>. I&#8217;m not sure we

  Perform Under Pressure, Shift Your Perspective</a></strong>. I enjoyed Steve&#8217;s
