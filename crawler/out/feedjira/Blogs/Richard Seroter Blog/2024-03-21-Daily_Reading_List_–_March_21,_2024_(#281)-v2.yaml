content: "\n<p>Are you good about taking a proper lunch hour? I&#8217;m hit or miss.
  Today was a ten minute lunch and I struggle to remember what I ate. Take care of
  yourself and eat food. At least I still was able to squeeze in some excellent blogs
  and articles today!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[blog] <strong><a href=\"https://daleonai.com/bigcontextwindows\">Big

  Not surprising, but it&#8217;s definitely clear that the OSS landscape has changed!
  Here&#8217;s more from Redis on <a href=\"https://redis.com/blog/the-future-of-redis/\">their
  future</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[article] <strong><a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/measuring-developer-productivity-humans.html#HowToCaptureQualitativeMetrics\">How

  used extensively for security but not for coding, JFrog survey finds</a></strong>.
