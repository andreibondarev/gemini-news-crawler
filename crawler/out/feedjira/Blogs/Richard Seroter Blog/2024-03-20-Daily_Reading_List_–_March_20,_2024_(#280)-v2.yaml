content: "\n<p>Another good day in Sunnyvale for a continuation of an offsite, and
  a couple of presentations to customers. Today&#8217;s reading list has a lot of
  AI, but also a mix of other topics. Enjoy!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[blog] <strong><a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2024/03/screenai-visual-language-model-for-ui.html\">ScreenAI:
  A visual language model for UI and visually-situated language understanding</a></strong>.
  Very cool research. A model that&#8217;s trained on UI layouts and infographics
  could really help with converting manual tasks to autonomous ones in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[blog]
  <strong><a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/teamcity/2024/03/meet-teamcity-pipelines/\">Make
  CI/CD Part of Your Development Flow With TeamCity Pipelines</a></strong>. JetBrains
  offers a mature CI/CD product, and it&#8217;s great that they&#8217;ve introduced
  a new flavor that looks like an &#8220;easy button&#8221; for deployment pipelines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[paper]

  Productivity for Humans, Part 8: Creativity in Software Engineering</a></strong>.
  What does it mean to be a creative developer? This research explores that question
  and finds a few categories to work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[blog] <strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/the-benefits-of-using-gke-for-running-ray-ai-workloads/\">Why
  GKE for your Ray AI workloads? Portability, scalability, manageability, cost</a></strong>.
  When folks complain about Kubernetes complexity, the first question should be &#8220;compared
  to what?&#8221; This post was a good example of where Kubernetes seems to make something
  simpler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[blog] <strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/using-kuberay-and-kueue-to-orchestrate-ray-applications-in-gke/\">Advanced
  scheduling for AI/ML with Ray and Kueue</a></strong>. Speaking of Ray, if you&#8217;re
  running it on Kubernetes, you&#8217;re probably using KubeRay. Which means you might
  be integrating with Kueue. Read about both here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[article] <strong><a
  href=\"https://hbr.org/2024/03/is-your-ai-first-strategy-causing-more-problems-than-its-solving\">Is
  Your AI-First Strategy Causing More Problems Than It’s Solving?</a></strong> I feel
  the same way about &#8220;AI first&#8221; as I do about &#8220;every company is
  a software company.&#8221; Neither are right. Your business goal should be delivering
  the best, most differentiated product or service. Use AI, don&#8217;t use AI, whatever.
  AI and software are &#8220;how&#8221;, not &#8220;why&#8221; or even &#8220;what.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[blog]

  <strong><a href=\"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-ai-developer/\">Is the

  announced Devin product (see <a href=\"https://shiftmag.dev/meet-devin-the-ai-software-engineer-2949/\">one
  take here</a>) more about positioning around Copilot than actually doing something
  new? Gergely takes a look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[article] <strong><a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3714282/getting-cozy-with-javas-new-softer-side.html\">Getting
