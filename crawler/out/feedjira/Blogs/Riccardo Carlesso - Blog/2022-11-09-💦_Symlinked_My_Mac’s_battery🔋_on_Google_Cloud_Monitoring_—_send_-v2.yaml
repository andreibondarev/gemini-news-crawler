  alt=\"Image Caption\" title=\"Taking a train to City Airport, my fav airport in
  London\" /></p>\n<p>This article shows how you can easily inject a generic key/value
  into Google Cloud Monitoring and set up alerts on it. I use it to alert on disk
  space, and now also low battery!</p>\n<p>This morning I was in London, and I forgot
  my charger at home. With plenty of time but \U0001FAAB little battery, I thought:
  hey! I need to have a way to predict when my battery is low! And I need to do it
  in a totally overkill way!</p>"
