  Bolognese</strong>: Everyone knows them… except Italians.</p><figure><img alt=\"\"

  imaginary dish, .. just like square root of -1, or like a word which doesn’t exist...
  just uselesser</figcaption></figure><p>Right, read it again if you don’t believe
  me… in Italy we don’t prepare that kind of pasta.</p><p>What the hell, you may be
  wondering… Italy is famous for spaghetti <em>and</em> bolognese sauce (that we call
  “ragù<em> alla bolognese</em>” or simply ragù<em>, (from </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragout\"><strong><em>r</em>agoût</strong></a>),
  but we would never mix these two things in the same dish).</p><p>Why oh why, you
  may as well think? I think the reason can be found in two ways.</p><p>First, they
  come from two different cultures. Spaghetti come from the south, where a simpler
  tomato, basil, and veg sauce would seem more appropriate.</p><p>Second, spaghetti
  are slippery, so they’re not as good to ‘retain’ a demanding sauce as a beef ragù
  is. As every bolognese person can tell you, appropriate pastas for bolognese ragù
  can be: tagliatelle (first choice), pennette/penne/mezzepenne, conchiglie, fusilli,
  maccheroni, … in general every form of ‘<strong>pasta rigata</strong>’ (<em>ribbed
  pasta</em>). Pasta rigata is a pasta that is not smooth, so thas sauce is more likely
  to stay with the pasta, instead of slipping down. I think the main reason why every
  person from Bologna is horrified by the mere idea of associating spaghetti with
  our proud ragÃ¹ is that we perfectly know (because everyone has made that mistake
  once in their life) what happens if you do that: spaghetti would ruthlessly come
  up your fork completely naked of any red or meaty trace… just to leave a gloomy
  surprise in the very end: a bloody pool of meat and tomato just looking at you as
  if asking “Now what?”. And unless you are Italian, you don’t know what scarpetta
  is. but that’s another story.</p><h4>What does wikipedia say?</h4><p>As Wikipedia
  (as of 19dec09) says about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolognese_sauce\">Bolognese_sauce</a>:</p><p><em>[…]
  </em>Bolognese sauce known in Italian as <strong>ragù alla bolognese</strong>, pronounced
  [, ragù bolognese, or simply ragù) is a meat-based sauce in Italian cuisine, typical
  of the city of Bologna. It is customarily used to dress tagliatelle al ragù and
  to prepare lasagne alla bolognese.</p><p>Italian ragù alla bolognese is a slowly
  cooked meat-based sauce, and its preparation involves several techniques, including
  sweating, sautéing and braising. Ingredients include a characteristic soffritto
  of onion, celery and carrot, different types of minced or finely chopped beef, often
  alongside small amounts of fatty pork. White wine, milk, and a small amount of tomato
  paste or tomatoes are added, and the dish is then gently simmered at length to produce
  a thick sauce.</p><p>Outside Italy, the phrase “Bolognese sauce” is often used to
  refer to a tomato-based sauce to which minced meat has been added; such sauces typically
  bear little resemblance to the Italian ragù alla bolognese, being more similar in
  fact to the ragù alla napoletana from the tomato-rich south of the country. Although
  in Italy ragù alla bolognese is not used with spaghetti (but rather with flat pasta,
  like tagliatelle),[2][3][4] so-called “spaghetti bolognese” has become a popular
  dish in many other parts of the world.[where</p><h4>I’m not Italian: what can we
