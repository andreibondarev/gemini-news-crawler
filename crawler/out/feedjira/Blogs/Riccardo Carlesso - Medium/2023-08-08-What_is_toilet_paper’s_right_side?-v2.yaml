content: "<p>There’s very little on this planet as polarizing as “the right position
  of toilet paper”: what I call <em>cis-centralis</em> /<em>pendens</em>, or <em>trans-centralis/</em>murālis<em>?
  </em>(yup, I just made those up — start googling \U0001F479).</p><figure><img alt=\"\"

  a <a href=\"https://rubyonrails.org/\">Ruby on Rails</a> developer, I’ve been long

  toilet paper patented the solution in 1891 (patent <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US459516\">US459516</a>,
  apparently Seth Wheeler was a Googler <em>ante litteram</em>).</p><figure><img alt=\"Wheeler

  have this <em>sheldonic</em> tendency of thinking people disagreeing with me on

  is one of those times :) After consulting a number of people who disagreed with
  me, trying to hold my initial disgust in this barbaric act of “muralic paper” (<em>Are
  you crazy?!? It gets dirty just before touching your butt!</em>) I realized there
  are cases where that configuration can actually do better.</p><ul><li>If you have
  a <strong>cat</strong>, the cat will likely like to play with the paper.</li><li>If
  you have a <strong>son</strong>, say his name is Sebastian . I don’t have any experimental
  proof that a daughter would yield the same results. Please comment to provide further
  data points.</li><li>There might be other occasions where this might be true (eg,
  windy location, gravity working against you, lot of liquid close to the precious
