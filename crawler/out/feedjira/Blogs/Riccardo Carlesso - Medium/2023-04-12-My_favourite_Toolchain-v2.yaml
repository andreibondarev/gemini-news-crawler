  /><figcaption>How <em>midjourney</em> imagines my favourite Toolchain, in 4 familiar
  colors ;)</figcaption></figure><p>Recently, my alter ego Richard asked a provocative
  question: are you happy with your toolchain, is it modern enough?</p><p>Before answering
  that question, o thought, first I need to assess it and enumerate it. Let’s see
  \U0001F648 what toolchain is:</p><ul><li><strong>Coding IDE</strong>: <strong>vscode</strong>.
  It is so amazing, I’ve tried something different, the OSS version, but it’s fast,
  extensible and just wow. The only missing thing is, a fast edit-over-ssh. But it’s
  not MS fault.</li><li><strong>Favourite language:</strong> <strong>Ruby</strong>.
  I know what you’re thinking, but it makes me happy, and efficient. I’ve tried other
  languages and frameworks, and nothing beats RoR in 2022 (I’ve spent 2 weekend to
  prove myself wrong, failing). If I need efficiency</li><li><strong>App Development:
  Ruby on Rails.</strong> I’ve given Js a go many times, it’s spectacular on many
  parts, but developing an app in a DRY way (rather than duplicating code for BE/FE)
  and having a single solid choice over a fragmentation of libs for me wins.</li><li><strong>CI:
  </strong>GCP <strong>Cloud Build</strong> and <a href=\"http://skaffoold.dev\"><strong>skaffold</strong></a>.
  I might be biased as Googler here.</li><li><strong>CD</strong>: <strong>Cloud Deploy</strong>
  and <strong>GitHub actions</strong>. Again, biased \U0001F60A</li><li><strong>CI/CD</strong>:
  Skaffold plus GCP tooling on top of github repos. Use <strong>kustomize</strong>
  to DRY the manifests.</li><li><strong>Serverless</strong>: <strong>Cloud Run</strong>
  and <strong>App Engine</strong>. Never been a huge fan of Cloud functions, or maybe
  I just don’t get them :)</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service\"><strong>IaaS</strong></a><strong> :
  Google Cloud Platform</strong>. If you ask my favourite product, I’d say <strong>GCE</strong>
  as it was my first love.</li><li><strong>PaaS: App Engine </strong>+ <strong>Heroku</strong>.</li><li><strong>SaaS:
  GitHub, Google Workspace, Atlassian Bitbucket</strong>.</li><li><strong>Infra as
  Code:</strong> <strong>Pulumi</strong> and <strong>Terraform</strong>. Back in the
  days, <strong>Chef</strong>.</li><li><strong>kubernetes</strong>: I love <strong>GKE</strong>
  remotely, and <strong>minikube</strong> locally. <strong>Kustomize</strong> to DRY
  my manifests. Not a big fan of Helm, tried it and hated it. Kpt is in my TODO list.</li><li><strong>Docker</strong>:
  I love <strong>docker-compose</strong>, although it doesn’t scale much. For simple
  single-apps, I use that. For more complex stuff, skaffold.</li><li><strong>Testing</strong>:
  I invented a bash testing suite — a friend told me I’d become famous — I didn’t
  \U0001F603. Happy to share code with you if you ask, and you’re back to the asylum tonight.</li></ul><p>More
