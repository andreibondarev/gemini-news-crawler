content: '<p>There has never been a better time to be a software developer. You’ve
  heard that enough … right? I truly believe so. With the advent of AI Code Assistants
  / AI Pair Programmer or other similar terms to describe the same thing, where does
  that leave software developers?</p><p>There is a camp that says that AI will take
  away software developer jobs? We’ve also been hearing that our younger generation
  should no longer learn programming? There are folks on the other side, who say that
  these AI code assistants are going to help the software developer get better? I
  believe that each of these views have some truth to it but the context and details
  matter. In this article, I am here to highlight the view <strong>“AI Code Assistants
  are going to help the software developer get better”</strong></p><p>Let’s cut through
  the noise first and dig a little deeper into what do we mean when we say that AI
  assistants are going to help the software developers get <strong>better</strong>
  or more <strong>efficient</strong> in doing their <strong>jobs</strong>. I have
  intentionally highlighted the words : better, efficient and jobs.</p><p>The word
  “better” and “efficient” is something that I will interpret as a given because any
  help that the assistants give to do our jobs, will be a positive outcome. And with
  every strong trend, like the one we are seeing now with AI Code Assistants, we are
  likely to see increasing investments and once the hype is settled and as adoption
  grows, we all benefit from these tools getting better and better at what they do.</p><p>So,
  lets move on to the 3rd word in there : jobs. It begs the question, What is the
  job of a software developer? We are likely to get tons of views again over there
  and my goal in this article is to highlight a couple of surveys that flip the question
  around “what are the jobs or tasks that software developers would like the AI Code
  Assistants to do?”. That should give us a good glimpse into not just the kind of
  activities that a developer does, but areas where they are hinting they need help
  to get more of it done in less time, more efficiently, faster, etc.</p><p>First
  up, is the RedMonk study titled “10 Things Developers Want from AI Code Assistants”
  (November 2023)</p><p><a href="https://redmonk.com/kholterhoff/2023/11/01/10-things-developers-want-from-ai-code-assistants/">10
  Things Developers Want from AI Code Assistants</a></p><p>I have taken the liberty
  here to summarize this into a table given below:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ol51ceGXYaYh9rXM6tSCvw.png"
  /></figure><p>Check out another survey, this time from <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#developer-tools-ai-tool">Stack
  Overflow (2023 Developer Survey)</a>. The chart below looks at what developers are
  using it for.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FZUE6u4LJlm--DHDELxJ9w.png"
  /></figure><p>The next chart presents an interesting view (what they plan or would
  be interested in using it for):</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y7NoPFHnvjwttDQxckmeCQ.png"
  /></figure><p>It would be fair to say that 3 areas that commonly come up from this are:</p><ol><li>Code
  Generation</li><li>Testing</li><li>Understanding Code, Documenting it, Getting information</li></ol><p>One
  can argue what is new in all of this? You did not need this trend to identify tasks
  that the software developers were supposed to be doing in any case.</p><p>This brings
  me to the point that I wish to highlight in this article and its clearly addressed
  to Managers, who are leading software development teams. The surveys above clearly
  shows that today, teams are using AI code assistants in multiple areas and/or are
  planning to use it. Getting help to get better at their roles, getting more work
  done efficiently, while still focusing on quality can have a transformative impact
  on the team.</p><h4>Call to Action</h4><p>You should look at investing your time
  into understanding and using these tools today in your team. Chances are that some
  of your developers are already familiar with them, have given them a try and have
  interesting data to share. The recommended approach would be to look at building
  out a Proof of Concept application utilising these tools, understand areas (both
  the most requested ones and even others from the list above) where the tools are
  making a positive difference. Do keep in mind that these tools are not perfect and
  have limitations, so look at their outputs carefully.</p><p>Happy Developers lead
  to positive business outcomes and the AI Code Assistants can play a big role in
  making the development process better and more efficient.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a0f88f58abf3"
