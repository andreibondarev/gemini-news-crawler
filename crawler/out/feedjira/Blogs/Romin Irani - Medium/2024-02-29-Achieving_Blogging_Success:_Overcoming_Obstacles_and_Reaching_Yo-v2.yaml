content: '<p>I have done a fair bit of blogging and managing blogs over the years
  and would like to take this opportunity to address some of the key questions/points
  that I am asked around blogging.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*YB-abF0rtPAtEtei.png"
  /><figcaption>Image Reference : <a href="https://creazilla.com/nodes/1717346-book-hand-pen-illustration">https://creazilla.com/nodes/1717346-book-hand-pen-illustration</a></figcaption></figure><p>I
  have categorized these frequently asked questions/concerns/doubts and have put down
  my thoughts for each of them. I respect each of these questions/points and I want
  to share my experience that can help you cross that bridge.</p><h3>I have not written
  before / Not good at writing</h3><p>There is always a first time. The most popular
  bloggers also started with their first post and look where they are now. We have
  all started somewhere, stumbled and got along.</p><p>The tools to get writing today
  have never been better and easier. Writing is a great way to improve and share your
  knowledge. Consider this as an opportunity and get started.</p><p>This point is
  coupled usually with the fact that most folks stay away from written communication
  stating that they are not good at writing. Some say their hold on the language that
  they wish to communicate in is not good. A few have remarked that “English is not
  my forte”.</p><p>To be honest, none of us are experts in any language or communication.
  Ask anyone who reads stuff online, that they are looking to learn, to get inspired,
  looking to connect to the ideas and perfect written communication is not something
  that they are looking for. This is not some school/college exam where you are going
  to get penalized for some grammar mistakes. If in doubt, use online tools to help
  you structure some of your statements. I can vouch that all of us who are reading
  your article do not give a second look to your perfectly crafted statements. So
  get your stories in place, because that matters and the words will help support
  it, perfect grammar or not.</p><h3>Start blogging</h3><p>One of my most enjoyable
  and importantly learning experience while blogging came from my writing at Programmable
  Web. Thank you John Musser and Adam DuVander for the opportunity. Over a period
  of a few years, I ended up covering 100s of artciles covering API News. As a side
  note, APIs still rule :-)</p><p>I remember that since covering this kind of news
  was new to me, I asked my editor, Adam, if I could first observe a few posts for
  a week or two and then start blogging. Adam caught that immediately and I distinctly
  remember him telling me that you just have to get started and that he will help
  to review and give feedback. That gave me a lot of confidence and indirectly it
  underlined the fact that you have to get in the water, if you have to swim.</p><p>So
  in essence, just like any other task, get started with, get your work reviewed,
  folks are there to make your writing better and soon you will get the framework
  that helps you create the posts.</p><p>Its perfectly fine to be a bit afraid about
  your first post, how it will be received but you have to get started. That is something
  that you have to do.</p><h3>Which topic to write about?</h3><p>You might be lucky
  if you are planning to write for a publication that has highlighted a few key topics
  on which they are looking out for articles. If those articles are in areas that
  you are already knowledgable about or are interested to explore, then it makes it easier.</p><p>But
  a majority of us may not have that data. In that case, my suggestion is to pick
  a topic that you are passionate about or are familiar with and which might be a
  more comfortable thing to start with. If you are working with a set of tools, languages,
  platforms at your work, that could be a good source to tap into also.</p><p>As script
  writers say, the stories are all around us and this is true when it comes to you.
  You definitely have a few topics that you can talk about. Just tap into those.</p><h3>This
  topic has been covered multiple times!!!</h3><p>This is a point that I have seen
  most folks new to blogging get discouraged by. They mention that the topic has been
  covered a lot by others, there is nothing new to cover here and a lot of overthinking
  starts.</p><p>My response to that is “Who cares?” . You can interpret my answer
  in a couple of ways. One would be to assume that I am asking you to write and not
  bother about anyone. But my real point when I say “Who cares?” is to actually understand
  that there are several folks who are interested in what you may write. You have
  a different view or style that the other 999 folks who have written on the topic.
  What matters is that you got out of the blocks, got a post in front of the world
  and I can assure you that there are folks who will read and benefit from your post.
  They do care about what you write, they will be investing their time in reading
  your post and might even learn a thing or not. So you focus on the what you can
  control i.e. the blog post and let the world know that you have written the post.</p><h3>I
  have an idea but am struggling to write!</h3><p>This is a valid concern and one
  that each one of us face, even if we have written 100s of blog posts. You know the
  drill : you have an idea or topic in your mind, you know the material and yet struggle
  to put a structure to the blog to get you started. Often called writer’s block but
  we don’t need to make things that complicated.</p><p>One of my first editors, when
  I wrote for Wrox publications in the year 2000, told me that it is very simple to
  write an article or a chapter for a book. The steps are as follows:</p><ol><li>You
  tell the audience what you are going to cover.</li><li>You cover it.</li><li>You
  tell the audience what you have covered.</li></ol><p>Simple … isn’t it? It does
  illustrate effectively that you could possibly use the above structure as a guide
  to get going. In my case, what really helps us when I write technical articles is
  to <strong>get my application code working</strong>. Once that is ready, I tell
  the folks what I am going to cover, then describe the working code and conclude
  by what they have seen. Try that the next time.</p><p>I don’t think there is a magic
  formula but be prepared to have your own tool available to write down ideas, points,
  etc that you may get anytime of the day. If you are planning a series of articles,
  put down the topics in a list that you would prefer to cover and then tackle them
  topic by topic. Divide and Conquer or breaking it down into immediate targets is
  also another strategy that has worked well for me.</p><h3>I am afraid of how my
  material will be accepted?</h3><p>The fear of feedback is real for all for us. I
  am not going to say that its easy and we need to be cool about that. Feedback is
  essential to improve and feedback at times can hurt your confidence. The same applies
  not just to writing but also to conference / event talks that you do.</p><p>I always
  believe that its essential to do a few things first. If you are going to talk and
  write in public, make sure that you are putting in your best effort into the material.
  As long as your process is sincere and its the best that you could do, you are a success.</p><p>An
  approach you can try is to have a few trusted folks that you can reach out to for
  review. If you are writing a book or for a popular publication, chances are that
  there is already a process where your work is reviewed before being approved for
  publication. If you are writing on your own blog, reach out to a few folks, who
  you believe would give you feedback from multiple angles. Take that feedback seriously,
  see what you can incorporate and then publish your article.</p><p>Worst case, what
  might happen? Someone might point out that they did not like the article? Ask them
  if there are areas that you could improve. Others may point that there are incorrect
  things in the blog post. Ask them to point them out and correct the blog post. The
  fact that you accepted some errors on your part (not intentional) and still went
  ahead and corrected it with feedback, is a great asset.</p><p>In one of the books
  that I wrote, one individual actually read the book page by page and incorporated
  suggestions/fixes across the book and highlighted in detail where the problems were.
  This was not from the book publishers reviewers but from someone in the general
  public. So be positive and you will be amazed to see genuine feedback from folks
  who recognize that you have put in the effort to share your knowledge on something
  new/recent and are willing to help fix it to make it more useful to others.</p><p>There
  will be your share of feedback which will be like a punch or might even sound rude.
  Even in those circumstances, see if there are any suggestions in there to improve
  or is it just a rant. For e.g. I was given feedback that one of my books was the
  worst technical book that has ever been published but with no other feedback. I
  moved on to the next feedback … we have to. That didn’t prevent me for continuing
  to write and share stuff that I like.</p><h3>What kind of format?</h3><p>This is
  an interesting point and one that I believe if addressed well can bring more people
  to blogs. Giving an example from the technical world, you should not be restricted
  or assume that technical blogs can be of a certain type or format only.</p><p>You
  can write a technical blog:</p><ul><li>Informational on the topic</li><li>Quick
  How to or Getting Started on the topic</li><li>A codelab that folks can try on the topic</li><li>Share
  a cool talk that you heard, an article you read, etc.</li><li>Summarize a few articles
  to read that you found useful and believe that others would benefit.</li><li>A competitive
  study that you have done about one tool/tech v/s the other.</li><li>Built an interesting
  tool or project. Open it up on Github and share it via a blog post.</li><li>Implemented
  a cool feature in your recent project. Write about it.</li><li>Fixed a tough problem.
  Help others who might be facing a similar issue with your solution.</li></ul><p>There
  are additional formats than the ones listed above. The takeaway point is that there
  is no right or wrong format. Not all formats may even be relevant to all your readers.
  You might not be comfortable writing about some of these formats. It’s completely
  fine. Pick one that you can start with.</p><h3>Just ask for help</h3><p>The power
  of the community is often underestimated by most of us. We also grossly underestimate
  the number of folks, who are ready to help out with their feedback and guidance.
  But that can only happen if you take the first step and just ask them. Feel free
  to reach out to your inner circle, trusted circle, folks you know give you constructive
  feedback when you are taking your first few steps in this. In fact, even as someone
  who is used to blogging, I end up reaching out to few folks on certain topics or
  a particular blog post that I’d like them to review first. There are plenty of good
  folks out there, who know more on most topics than each one of us. So as long you
  are comfortable and accepting of that fact, help is just a message away.</p><h3>Its
  an investment of my time. I need to get paid.</h3><p>This is a fair point and I
  would leave it to each one of you individually to decide if you want to get compensated
  for each blog post that you write. You need to consider publications that you can
  write for, which may give you a token amount for each blog post. On the other hand,
  if you are writing at your own blog, you do have a choice of earning some income
  from it (the amounts may not be astronomic but you have the option). Examples of
  this include Medium which has a member only stories option or at your personal blog,
  you could use some relevant Ads.</p><p>In my experience, every blog that I have
  written has paid me back several times (whether I was paid for it or not). It has
  paid me back in becoming a better writer, able to communicate technical terms better,
  got me valuable readers that give me feedback, opened up opportunities via folks
  reaching out vis-a-vis the topic that I have written and more. So keep a long term
  view in terms of multiple returns that you will get for your time investment.</p><p>There
  is a big difference between someone holding a job and doing blogging occasionally
  and someone who does blogging/reporting/technical writing for a living. The latter
  definitely will look at avenues that can sustain them and getting paid for it is
  a high priority for them.</p><h3>Why should I blog?</h3><p>If you have been reading
  this article and reached this section, I don’t think you need this section since
  you have your own judgement on how blogging is useful.</p><p>I personally believe
  that blogging regularly has benefits and all of which I may not be able to list
  down here or do justice to them via examples. Here are some points from my experience:</p><ul><li>It
  helps me or forces me in a good way to learn more about a topic. Its similar to
  teaching a class. It will make you read a bit more, try out ways to explain a topic,
  makes you double check a few things and more.</li><li>It definitely helps to improve
  your communication skills. Written skills are important or have never been as important
  as they are today, given the age of Gen AI tools that we live in today.</li></ul><p>All
  the best for your blogging journey. Do share in your own experiences that got you
  started and any other tips/advice that you may have for writers.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=641d424bf064"
