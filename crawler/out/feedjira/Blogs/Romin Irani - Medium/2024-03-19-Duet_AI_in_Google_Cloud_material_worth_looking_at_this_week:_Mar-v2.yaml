  attention.</p><p>First up, we have an <a href=\"https://medium.com/@larry_nguyen/duet-ai-for-developers-using-vscode-e8315260bb9b\">article</a>
  by <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/71429b330390\">Larry Nguyen</a> that takes you
  through the various steps of using Duet AI for application development. The article
  starts off with Duet AI Setup and then building from scratch an application that
  manages a list of people. The data is backed with a Firestore database and there
  is even a web front-end that is built out. Check it out.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@larry_nguyen/duet-ai-for-developers-using-vscode-e8315260bb9b\">Duet

  anyone say codelabs? Duet AI is best experienced by doing something with it. We
  have a series of codelabs (last count was 10) that have been published in the last
  couple of months and you can try them out in your own Google Cloud project. Check
  out this codelab list. I have put them together in a specific order that will gradually
  introduce you to Duet AI.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-developer-duetai?hl=en\">A
