  attention.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/316/0*w5mOtHVpRnSxVAuK.png\"

  Duet AI</strong></p><p>This is an excellent session that can be one that you can
  use both for your own understanding and also across the organization. It manages
  to cover a whole range of topics from developer productivity, what problem Duet
  AI addresses, key areas that Duet AI can help out developers and demonstrations
  of the same. I liked the take on how Developer Productivity, which if boosted through
  tools like Duet AI, can directly influence positive business outcomes.</p><iframe

  Vipassana Season 5 Session 3: Duet AI to accelerate test driven development</strong></p><p>Test
  Driven Development is a key methodology when working with an existing code base
  and then introducing new functionality. Duet AI is well suited to this since it
  supports you with Code explanaibility, code generation, test case generation and
  documentation. If you get this technique right and Duet AI works well, you are bound
  to see a good productivity improvement and still ensuring a code % of code coverage.
  This session uses the Ruby language, so a good way for you to even check out how
  well Duet AI supports the language.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FOIv68OWuEXk&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DOIv68OWuEXk&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FOIv68OWuEXk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\"

  AI for building a Chrome Extension app in JavaScript</strong></p><p>This is an interesting
  session from Code Vipassana Season 5 again. This time, you build out a Chrome Extension
  with Duet AI’s assistance. The essence of such a session is to show that you could
  pretty use Duet AI for a wide variety of tasks. Often folks ask this question on
  how well Duet AI will work for a specific language, framework or task? The usual
  answer that I give is … try it.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fp8_m6bG3iwQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dp8_m6bG3iwQ&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fp8_m6bG3iwQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\"
