  by <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/seroter\"><strong>Richard Seroter</strong></a>:
  This article while not focused solely on Duet AI covers a good set of areas that
  you will need to look into when it comes to Modernizing an Application. The areas
  covered include understanding existing code bases, code refactoring, migrating to
  new languages/framework. Duet AI can play a good assistive role here. Check out
  the <a href=\"https://seroter.com/2024/02/21/how-id-use-generative-ai-to-modernize-an-app/\">article</a>.</li><li><strong>Test-Driven
  Development with Java, Spring Boot and Duet AI in GCP</strong> by <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ddobrin?source=post_page-----3bb6fd4d0822--------------------------------\"><strong>Dan
  Dobrin</strong></a>: Any developer out there will agree that a good part of their
  work is to take existing code bases and add new functionality to it. The key tasks
  there would be to get a good understanding of the code and then introduce new functionality
  in the right places. And when it comes to adding new functionality, how about a
  Test Driven Development approach to building that out? Dan Dobrin covers exactly
  that in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/google-cloud/test-driven-development-with-java-spring-boot-and-duet-ai-in-gcp-3bb6fd4d0822\">detailed
  article</a> that takes an existing repository and takes you through the steps of
  how you would use Duet AI as your assistant in that task.</li><li><strong>Explore
  Duet AI to assist with React frontend application development</strong> by <a href=\"https://medium.com/@rickruguichen?source=post_page-----cc39df3ce7d9--------------------------------\"><strong>Rick
  Chen</strong></a><strong> : </strong>It is my observation that a lot of articles
  that cover Duet AI are focused on backend frameworks or core programming languages
  and that seems to be give an impression that Duet AI is probably well suited to
  those tasks only. First up, check out a l<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/duet-ai/docs/developers/supported-languages\">ist
  of Programming Languages and Interfaces</a> that Duet AI supports. Next up, for
  all you React framework users and there are plenty of them, check out this article
  by Rick Chen on how to use Duet AI to help us with React and TypeScript to build
  a client-side web app. The <a href=\"https://medium.com/google-cloud/explore-duet-ai-to-assist-with-react-frontend-appldevelopment-cc39df3ce7d9\">article</a>
  explores its assistive features in the areas of bootstrapping the app, async communication,
  styling and more.</li></ul><p>\U0001F449 For all Duet AI resources, check out the
