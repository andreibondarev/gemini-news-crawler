  this issue and share the <a href="https://gcptechnuggets.substack.com/">subscription
  form</a> with your peers.</p><h3>Google Cloud NEXT ’24 Updates</h3><p>Google Cloud
  NEXT ’24 is just a few weeks away. If you are attending the event in-person, the
  <a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/session-library?utm_source=cgc-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=FY24-Q2-global-ENDM33-physicalevent-er-next-2024-mc&amp;utm_content=cgc-blog-session-launch-feb&amp;utm_term=-">full
  list of sessions</a> is now available. You can also make use of the Agenda Builder
  to plan out attending the sessions that you don’t want to miss. Check out the <a
  href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/full-session-catalog-now-live-for-google-cloud-next24">blog

  in the post.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*vsTKI3JJFN9vmIR8.jpg"
  /></figure><h3>Containers and Kubernetes</h3><p>There are several updates in this
  space for this edition of the newsletter.</p><p>Solution Architectures are all about
  tradeoffs isn’t it? Regional or a Zonal cluster for your GKE environments? You have
  to consider multiple points like availability, costs, maintenance, scalability and
  more. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/choosing-a-regional-vs-zonal-gke-cluster">detailed
  article</a> that breaks down each of these points vis-a-vis Regional and Zonal clusters.</p><figure><img
  alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PCTIhE45lk5Gpe84ydZiuA.png"
  /></figure><p>Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in Autopilot mode is seeing significant
  updates of late to make it ideally suited to running your AI workloads, not just
  from the manageability perspective but from the choice of compute options. There
  are two new compute classes in Autopilot that have been introduced: Accelerator
  and Performance. The Accelerator class improves GPU support with resource reservation
  capabilities. The Performance class enables high-performance workloads to run on
  Autopilot mode at scale. There are several pricing updates too, including a price
  cut for majority of GPU workloads running on GKE in Autopilot mode, along with the
  ability to keep your existing Reservations and committed use discounts, as you move
  your workloads between the Standard and Autopilot modes of GKE, as well as between
  Compute Engine VMs. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/new-features-to-run-ai-more-efficiently-on-fully-managed-gke">post</a>
  for more details.</p><p>Have you heard about ECK? It is Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes
  and the official Elastic Operator for Kubernetes. If you are looking to run the
  Elastic Stack on a cloud-native Kubernetes environment, then this is the way to
  go. Combine that with running it on GKE in Autopilot mode, and the combination gets
  the best of both services. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gke-autopilot-supports-elastic-cloud-on-kubernetes">blog
  post</a> for more details.</p><p>Looking to create an Internal Developer Platform
  (IDP) for your teams, as part of Platform Engineering, you need to consider a foundation
  that can provide flexibility in terms of the requirements that your developers would
  have. Kubernetes is a solid foundation to do that due to the abstractions that it
  has available. But building one is a significant task and there is good help here
  in terms of the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gke-build-an-enterprise-developer-platform-for-fast-app-delivery">blog
  post</a> and a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/enterprise-application-blueprint">detailed
  solution guide</a>. Check it out.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gkFV7tQu5_qr2DcI.png"
  /></figure><p>One more post that highlights the GKE Autopilot value proposition
  and this time it is about how it handles security for you. In summary, it helps
  you configure nodes, node pools, and in-cluster policy for you according to security
  best practices, allowing you to focus on workload-specific security. Check out this
  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/move-in-ready-kubernetes-security-with-gke-autopilot">informative
  article</a> to brush up on Kubernetes security aspects and what Autopilot mode does
  for you, as part of the shared fate operating model.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/991/0*NrHMWPCs6N1SpxGD.png"

  journey at your organization and the initial applications that you have containerized
  and moved to Cloud Run have been a success. On top of that, you have achieved some
  of these numbers: 70% toil reduction, 90% cost savings, and unlocked new capabilities
  by integrating with some of the services available on Google Cloud? This is exactly
  what DZ Bank, the second largest bank in Germany in terms of assets, has published.
  Check out their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/how-dz-bank-uses-a-cloud-run-first-approach-to-unlock-big-savings">story</a>.</p><figure><img
  alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*OAIjCEqjo-cyfYrB.png" /></figure><p>Another
  customer success is from Glance, which provides innovative lock screen experiences
  across millions of mobile phones. Glance recently migrated their database from Azure
  Cosmos DB to Cloud Spanner. The move was needed due to the frequent need to optimize
  their application vis-a-vis the database requirements and operations management
  too. To select a database, they conducted a month-long proof of concept with various
  databases to ensure that their pipelines worked along with their performance requirements.
  Spanner emerged as the Database of choice. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/why-glance-migrated-its-document-database-to-spanner">post</a>
  that discusses their experience, reasons for moving, what Spanner provides them
  and more.</p><h3>Identity and Security</h3><p>Security Command Center Enterprise
  edition has been announced. It fuses cloud and enterprise security requirements
  into a single offering that you can use across your multi-cloud environments. The
  edition is integrated with various aspects of Mandiant solutions too. Check out
  the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-security-command-center-enterprise">blog</a>
  for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/633/0*I9Y9h6q2o4Tyy3GT.png"
  /></figure><p>The first of Google Cloud Security Talks of 2024 have started. By
  the time, this newsletter reaches out, the first edition on March 13 would have
  completed. You can still visit the on-demand page and view the sessions. There are
  several interesting topics around Gen AI and its role in security along with regular
  updates on threat intelligence. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/join-our-first-security-talks-of-2024">post</a>
  for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*MR9muIji4V4p43Nk.png"
  /></figure><h3>Machine Learning</h3><p>The rate at which the Gen AI foundational
  models are being made available by various providers is astounding. Speaking of
  Anthropic’s Claude 3 models, they are soon going to be available on Vertex AI Model
  Garden, with one of the models (Sonnet), which is best combination of skills and
  speed is now available in private preview for customers. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-anthropics-claude-3-models-in-google-cloud-vertex-ai">blog
  post</a> on this announcement.</p><p>It is generally accepted now that while foundational
  models are more than capable, the way forward is to have a specialized model for
  your domain. But which approach should you use to specialize it. Should you use
  Prompt Engineering, RAG or Fine tuning? Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/three-step-design-pattern-for-specializing-llms">post</a>
  that gives you an overview of these approaches and a side-by-side comparison.</p><figure><img
  alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*J4deyAgU8O-5w6ip.png" /></figure><h3>Databases</h3><p>As
  Organizations continue to grapple with how to maximize capabilities with Gen AI,
  the fundamental point remains that you will need to have ability to access, manage,
  and activate all types of data. What this means for Cloud Providers is to assess
  this development and see how their own services around Database products stands
  and adding native Gen AI capabilities within the products itself. In a key blog
  post that highlights how Google Cloud has expanded the GenAI capabilities across
  key products like BigQuery, AlloyDB, Spanner and more is noteworthy. With this capabilities,
  your usage of cross services goes up but then the data and governance can be better
  managed. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/bigquery-and-alloydb-hit-major-milestone-with-ai-enabled-updates">blog
  post</a> in details that highlights some of these developments.</p><p>In a similar
  key <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/discover-new-gen-ai-google-cloud-database-capabilities">post</a>,
  read about announcements around general availability (GA) of AlloyDB AI, an integrated
  set of capabilities in AlloyDB to easily build Enterprise Gen AI apps and introduction
  of vector search capabilities across Spanner, MySQL, and Redis. There is also an
  increasing integration with LangChain across these features.</p><p>Speaking of LangChain
  integrations, the key question is what are the LangChain packages that leverage
  these new Google Cloud database features. The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/build-rag-applications-with-langchain-and-google-cloud">blog
  post</a> highlights the packages around Document Loaders, Vector Stores and Chat
  Messages Memory. If you are developer who is using the popular LangChain framework
  and wants to try out these Google Database integrations, this is a must read post
  to show you the path. The post has Getting Started guides too.</p><figure><img alt=""
  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2gPRX0o17wqXWp76Xunzug.png" /></figure><p>Several
  blog posts have been specifically written on the various database services, their
  support for Gen AI, LangChain frameworks and how you can start building out applications
  with them. Here is a list:</p><ul><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/cloud-sql-for-mysql-supports-vector-embeddings-search">Build
