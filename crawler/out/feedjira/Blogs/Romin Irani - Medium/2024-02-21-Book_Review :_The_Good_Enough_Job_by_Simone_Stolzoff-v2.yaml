  Good Enough Job: What We Gain When We Don’t Put Work First by Simone Stolzoff</a>.</p><figure><img
  alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/341/0*RNZYV83Ns-RvXx_d.jpg" /></figure><p>This
  book starts on a solid note with a question to you that goes something like “Who
  are you?”. I don’t know how you will answer that question but often, as the author
  notes, we usually define ourselves with our current job/role.</p><p>This question
  is one that I have struggled to answer myself and most importantly, battled for
  a long time now to disconnect my identity vis-a-vis my work life.</p><p>Simone takes
  a refreshing approach to this topic in keeping the content real and away from a
  preachy and theoretical treatise by covering each chapter to bust a work myth via
  real people and their life stories. I particularly liked this style since it kept
  me engaged and identify at times with what each of the folks in the story were going through.</p><p>The
  work myths that are addressed effectively are:</p><ul><li>We are what we do</li><li>Your
  job can be your God</li><li>Dream jobs</li><li>Your work is your worth</li><li>Workplace
  can be your family</li><li>Working more hours always leads to better work</li><li>Cushy
  office perks</li><li>Status equals success</li><li>Personal boundaries</li></ul><p>I
  have never believed in some of the points above and it was good to see similar experiences
  with folks in the stories covered.</p><p>I believe this book is a timely reminder
  to all of us to figure out our identity , that is not intervened with our work.
  Easier said than done but something that is an important topic to me of late.</p><img
