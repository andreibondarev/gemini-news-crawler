  the young mind are well established, particularly in the area of language acquisition.
  But in some dimensions, we may actually learn better at a more advanced age.</p><p>If
  you know about Kahneman’s theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">fast
  and slow thinking</a>, it seems to me that the younger brain’s fast thinking engine
  has a significant advantage, while the older brain’s slow thinking facilities are
  likely more refined.</p><p>The article below relates the story of a father who set
  out to teach his young daughter how to play chess, while learning the game himself,
  at the same time. An excerpt I found poignant:</p><blockquote><em>…but there was
  the look in her eyes as I checkmated her a second time. For whatever the games had
  taught me about brains young and old, about the different ways we learn and deploy
  our cognitive resources, they also taught me that the only thing harder than losing
  to your daughter in chess is winning against her.</em></blockquote><p>This article
  reminded me of my own experience teaching my daughter the game of chess, which is
  captured in the photo above.</p><blockquote><em>What I learned trying to keep up
  with my 4-year-old daughter at the royal game. @NautilusMag </em><a href="http://nautil.us/issue/36/aging/learning-chess-at-40"><em>http://nautil.us/issue/36/aging/learning-chess-at-40</em></a></blockquote><p><em>Originally
