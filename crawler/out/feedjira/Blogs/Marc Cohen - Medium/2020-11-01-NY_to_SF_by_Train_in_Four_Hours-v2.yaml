  world’s. Here’s how to fix that, and a few other problems along the way.</p><p>Under
  FDR’s leadership, the federal government pulled the United States out of the Great
  Depression, in part, by funding ambitious public works projects, like building our
  vast interstate highway system. Now we’re in the midst of another severe depression,
  calling for another round of big thinking and big investment.</p><p>What better
  priority to focus on than building a network of high speed, clean energy trains.
  Such an infrastructure would be a triple win:</p><ol><li>revolutionize transportation
  in the US,</li><li>drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and</li><li>create
  a vast array of new jobs.</li></ol><p>I know what you’re saying — dream on, Marc,
  that’ll never happen. But check out the article below about major advances by a
  Dutch company, promising safe, clean, and efficient 600 mph trains. Can you imagine
  what we could accomplish by focusing our resources on this problem with the same
  intensity we brought to sending a man to the Moon?</p><p>A 600 mpg train would enable
  travel from New York to Washington D.C. in thirty minutes and a cross country journey
  in four hours.</p><p>After Joe Biden takes the oath of office, this should be a
  domestic priority. I can’t think of a better way to restart our economy, reduce
  our collective climate footprint, and build something of lasting value for future
  generations.</p><blockquote><em>Plans for a new form of transportation are well
  underway, suggesting that by 2040 we might have a more efficient and environmentally
  friendly way to travel. (</em><a href="https://matadornetwork.com/read/futuristic-capsule-transportation-will-link-paris-amsterdam-fast/"><em>source</em></a><em>)</em></blockquote><p><em>Visit
