  /></figure><p>There seems to be a widely held opinion that this election was close.</p><p>I
  think it’s due to the fact that several states, like Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin,
  were indeed decided by less than 1% of votes cast. But when looking at the aggregate
  outcome, it’s hard to characterize the result as anything but historically decisive.</p><p><a

  article</a> from The Nation notes that, despite Trump’s claim to have “WON THIS
  ELECTION, BY A LOT!”, you’d have to go back <em>88 years</em> to find an incumbent
  loss by this margin — Biden won a higher precentage of the vote than any incumbent
  challenger since FDR defeated Herbert Hoover in 1932.</p><blockquote><em>The president
  may deny reality, but he cannot change the fact that he is now losing the popular
  vote and the Electoral College by momentous margins. @TheNation </em><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-lost-denial-pompeo/"><em>https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-lost-denial-pompeo/</em></a></blockquote><p><em>Originally
