  /></figure><p>Can you imagine the sort of worldwide panic that would ensue if everyone’s
  smart phone suddenly stopped working? Something analogous happened thirty years
  ago when, on January 15, 1990, the entire US long-distance telephone network crashed
  for nine hours.</p><blockquote><em>This was a strange, dire, huge event. During
  the nine long hours of frantic effort that it took to restore service, some seventy
  million telephone calls went uncompleted.</em></blockquote><p>I was working at Bell
  Labs at the time, which was a subsidiary of AT&amp;T. Limited and isoated failures,
  akin to modern outages in your ISP’s internet service, were relatively common in
  those days, however, this sort of ubiquitous and sustained service breakdown taking
  out the entire network was unprecedented.</p><blockquote><em>Bell Labs engineers,
  working feverishly in New Jersey, Illinois, and Ohio, first tried their entire repertoire
  of standard network remedies on the malfunctioning System 7. None of the remedies
  worked, of course, because nothing like this had ever happened to any phone system before.</em></blockquote><p>Perhaps
  the most interesting aspect of the story: the crash of Janurary 15, which happened
  to be Martin Luther King Day, was not caused by Russian agents, cybercriminals,
  or hackers. <strong>The entire calamity was caused by one line of errant code, written
  by one very unlucky programmer.</strong></p><blockquote><em>As it happened, the
  problem itself — the problem per se — took this form. A piece of telco software
  had been written in C language, a standard language of the telco field. Within the
  C software was a long “do… while” construct. The “do… while” construct contained
  a “switch” statement. The “switch” statement contained an “if” clause. The “if”
  clause contained a “break.” The “break” was supposed to “break” the “if clause.”
  Instead, the “break” broke the “switch” statement.</em></blockquote><p>Read the
  whole amazing story in the article linked below.</p><blockquote><em>On January 15,
  1990, AT&amp;T’s long-distance telephone switching system crashed. </em><a href="http://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html"><em>http://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html</em></a></blockquote><p><em>Originally
