  been teaching Python programming for several years and I’ve discovered some great
  tools and techniques to help students learn and to make the teacher’s life easier.
  Read on to learn the things I wished I knew when I started teaching.</p><h4>Jupyter
  what?</h4><p><a href="http://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a> is an open source software
  technology which enables authoring and executing interactive documents combining
  explanations and code. If you’ve not experienced this sort of computing tool before,
  the best way to get acquainted is to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15KAyGvriQwRoXQa3t70jmi3XumKBxDRi">try one</a>.</p><p>The
  notebook metaphor seems apt because you can save your work so you have a record
  of your learning session. But it’s really a turbo-charged notebook because you can
  access it from anywhere, you can copy and remix the original, add any additional
  code blocks or notes, and share it with the world.</p><h4>Ok, this is great but
  how do I make this available to my students?</h4><p>Once you realize the power of
  Jupyter Notebooks, your next question will probably be “how do I setup a service
  so my students can use this tool?”. In the bad old days, the answer was something
  like this:</p><ul><li>acquire some hardware</li><li>install some software</li><li>configure
  and administer everything</li><li>deal with it when it breaks</li></ul><p>Congratulations — you’re
  a system administrator!</p><p>Fortunately, nowadays we have cloud services that
  can make your life much easier. Since this is the Google Colab blog, that’s the
  service I’m going to focus on in this article, though you should know there are
  other good Notebooks servieces out there. Colab provides free cloud hosted Jupyter
  notebooks for everyone. I like to think of Colab as “Google Docs for Jupyter” because,
  like Docs, the service is free, it stores your work for safekeeping, and it gives
  you the ability to share your creations with anyone.</p><h4>How do I use it?</h4><p>This
  is the best part. Whether you’re a teacher or a student, your journey starts the
  same way: just click on a link. You’ll be able to create a new notebook, run someone
  else’s notebook (or one of your own), share a notebook with others, etc. All via
  your favorite web browser.</p><p>Let’s imagine today’s the first day of your Python
  Programming 101 course. An inquisitive student raises her hand and earnestly asks:
  “Professor, what software do we need to install?”. You can barely contain your giddiness
  in responding: “There’s nothing to intall; we’ll be doing all our coursework in
  a web browser. Let me show you an example.” Doesn’t that feel great?</p><p>Hopefully
  you now understand, at a high level, how Colab can help you in the classroom. Stay
  tuned for Part 2, in which we’ll see some more concrete, practical tips, like using
  Colab for your lecture and review notes, your homework assignments, and your learning
  assessments.</p><p>Are you using Colab in the classroom? Please add a comment below
