  Smartphone,</p><p>We’ve had a great relationship over the years. You bring the world
  right to my fingertips. And you’re always there for me. Unfortunately, I’m a little
  too into you.</p><p>I found myself spending more and more of my time focusing on
  you rather than the world around me. It got to the point where I would put you down
  and then seconds later find you were back in my hand, without even realizing I’d
  picked you up again.</p><p>Lately, most of the time we spend together is not quality
  time. It’s just bouncing around between my favorite apps and websites, waiting for
  that little dopamine hit that comes from finding an interesting news item or something
  cool in my twitter feed. But think about the opportunity cost of all that time spent
  staring at my hand.</p><p>I’ve suspected our relationship was unhealthy for few
  years and I’ve tried so many methods to manage our time together. But I keep coming
  back to you. So I started wondering, what’s the minimal set of functions I need
  at my fingertips 24x7?</p><ul><li>make and receive voice calls</li><li>send and
  receive text messages</li><li>take pictures</li></ul><p>That’s it. That’s all I
  really want from a device in my pocket. What about email? I can do that on my laptop.
  Google, New York Times, online chess? Same answer. Facebook? I quit years ago. Instagram,
  TikTok? No thanks.</p><p>So I disabled your wifi and cellular data and removed all
  but the three apps above. I even removed Chrome. I know that hurt your feelings
  but I’ve decided to put a priority on my productivity and wellbeing.</p><p>I know
  what you’re thinking. How can I possibly survive without you? Remember this: I lived
  most of my life in the pre-smart-phone era and I did pretty well. I read books,
  I talked with people, and I thought deeply about things.</p><p>This song says it
  more eloquently than I could:</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FGHnfcd_k2O4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGHnfcd_k2O4&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FGHnfcd_k2O4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"

  know this is a cliche but it’s true: It’s not you, smartphone, it’s me. You’re a
  wonderful piece of technology but I want more out of life than you can give me.</p><p>Yours
  truly,<br> Marc</p><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href="https://mco.dev/its-not-you-its-me/"><em>https://mco.dev</em></a><em>
