  is this?</h3><p>This publication is a repository of Palestinians’ stories told in
  their own voices, in the form of text, audio, and video.</p><h3>Why is it needed?</h3><p>A
  <a href="https://www.972mag.com/us-media-palestinians/">study</a> by the University
  of Arizona’s Maha Nassar found that of the opinion articles about Palestinians published
  in The New York Times and The Washington Post between 2000 and 2009, Palestinians
  themselves wrote roughly 1 percent (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/opinion/israel-american-jews-zionism.html?campaign_id=39&amp;emc=edit_ty_20240323&amp;instance_id=118291&amp;nl=opinion-today&amp;regi_id=72982178&amp;segment_id=161582&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=2cd37a855f14f318a21bf53c9729ed28">source</a>).
  <strong>This needs to change.</strong></p><h3>How can I share my story?</h3><p>You
  have a few options:</p><ol><li><strong>Medium Authoring</strong>: Create an account
  on Medium.com (make it anonymous if you prefer not to be identified). Reach out
  to me privately and I’ll make you a writer. Once you’re a writer, you can freely
  write stories and submit them for publication on this site. This is probably the
  most efficient option for both of us if you’d like to contribute multiple stories.</li><li><strong>Proxy
  Authoring</strong>: No need to interact with Medium.com, just email me your story
  and I’ll publish it for you in your name or anonymously, per your preference.</li><li><strong>Text
  Interview:</strong> Clone <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cktFnxaiw-Mt4GhlSasPrMiu_DYnipQ2j4F9UtBb0aw/edit?usp=sharing">this
  doc</a> containing a short list of interview questions, submit your answers and
  share it back with me. I’ll take care of publishing the interview in your name or
  anonymously, per your preference.</li><li><strong>Audio or Video Interview:</strong>
  I meet you via videoconference and record the audio, video, or both of a short interview
  where I ask you questions about your life and experiences. If you prefer anonymity,
  I’ll transcribe the audio or video into a text article and destroy the original
  recording. If you’re ok with being heard/seen, I’ll publish the audio/video (edited
  for time and clarity) <strong>but only after you approve the publication copy</strong>.</li></ol><p>If
  you’d like to contact me to submit a story, to be interviewed, or to ask any questions
  you might have, you can reach me via email at <strong>marc@mco.dev</strong>.</p><h3>Should
  I worry about being identified?</h3><p>Sadly, we live in a world in which antisemitism
  is increasingly weaponized against anyone who dares to criticize Israel. People
  have been harassed and jobs have been lost. If you have a story to tell but are
  concerned about retribution, I will do everything I can to protect your identify.
  All four options above include an anonymous authoring scenario. Note that option
  1 above depends on medium.com protecting your identity. If you’re uncomfortable
  with that, I recommend options 2–4.</p><p>The fact that people have to fear simply
  telling the true story of their lives in their own names is a sad commentary on
  the state of repression and fear Palestinians have to endure.</p><h3>How do I know
  I can trust you?</h3><p>Options 2–4 avoid trusting medium.com but I can’t get around
  you having to trust me. If you have a story to share but are concerned about my
  trustworthiness (which I completely understand), I’m happy to meet with you by videoconference
  and will happily answer any questions you may have and give you a chance to get
  to know me and assess my sincerity and reliability for yourself.</p><h3>Who are you?</h3><p>I’m
  not myself Palestinian — I’m a Jewish American Google engineer living in London.
  Like many, I’m appalled not only by the genocide in Gaza, but also by the Apartheid
  regime and general oppression of the Palestinian people which Israel has perpetuated
  over the past 75 years.</p><p>Once you get to know someone, it’s harder to believe
  the propaganda you may have heard about them. I created this publication to make
  a safe place for Palestinians to tell their stories so that more people can get
  to know them and understand their history, their struggles, and their hopes and dreams.</p><img
