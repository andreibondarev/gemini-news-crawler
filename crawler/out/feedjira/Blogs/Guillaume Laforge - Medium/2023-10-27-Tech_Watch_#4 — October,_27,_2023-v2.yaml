  is pretty interesting to read (even if long!). Among the major sections: research,
  industry, but also politics, safety, and some predictions. You’ll find an executive
  summary in one slide, on slide #8.<br>On #22, <strong>emergent capabilities of LLMs</strong>
  is covered and mentions Stanford’s research that talks about the importance of more
  linear and continuous measures as otherwise capabilities sound like they emerge
  out of the blue.<br>On #23, they talk about the <strong>context length of LLMs being
  the new parameter count</strong>, as models try to have bigger context windows.<br>However,
  on slide #24, they also talk about researchers who showed that <strong>in long context
  windows the content provided in the middle is more ignored</strong> by LLMs compared
  to content at the beginning or end of the window.<br>So be sure to <strong>put the
  important bits first or last</strong>, but not lost in the middle.<br>Slide #26
  speaks about <strong>smaller models trained with smaller curated datasets and can
  rival 50x bigger models</strong>.<br>Slide #28 wonders if we’re <strong>running
  out of human-generated data</strong>, and thus, if we’re going to have our LLMs
  trained on… LLM generated data!</li><li><a href="https://projector.tensorflow.org/">3D
  visualisation of vector embeddings from Tensorflow</a><br>As I’m working on a small
  application that would help visuliase vector embeddings, I was looking for existing
  apps or articles that show how vectors can be similar, and thus their semantic to
  be similar as well. And I came across this existing visualisation from the Tensorflow
  project, which uses the Word2Vec embedding approach. I like the fact you can use
  different 3D projections techniques like t-SNE or PCA, and you see related vectors
  closer in the 3D space, as their meaning is closer too.</li><li><a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2023/10/26/making-postgres-tick-new-features-in-pg-cron/">A
  cron extension for PostgreSQL</a><br>pg_cron is an extension for the PostgreSQL
  database that adds scheduling capabilities. It can even be scheduled to run your
  procedures or other SQL queries every few seconds.</li><li><a href="https://protomaps.com/">Protomaps</a>
  is a free and open source map of the world, deployable as a single static file on
  cloud storage (including Google Cloud Storage). You can use OpenStreetMap tiles,
  as it’s distributed with a version of OSM. It’s using an efficient and open archive
  format for pyramids of tile data, accessible via HTTP Range requests.</li><li><a
  href="https://artistassistapp.com/">ArtistAssistApp</a> is an application which
  can tell you which oil or water color paints to use and mix to create similar looking
  colors for your painting, as you try to reproduce a photo. As a wannabe painter
  myself, I always struggle creating mixes that match real colors, and this tool is
  pretty clever to let you find the right mix (at least if you use some well-known
  paint brands). This also reminds me of <a href="https://scrtwpns.com/mixbox/">mixbox</a>
  which simulates color mixing as real color pigments mix in real paint, and using
  such algorithm would greatly improve the real-life accuracy of color mixes in digital
  art painting applications.</li><li><a href="https://vectorizer.ai/">Vectorizer</a>
  is an online tool to transform an image into an SVG file. As I’m playing a bit with
  Generative AI-based image generation, sometimes, the upscalers don’t suffice, and
  you want to transform a nice generated image into a vectorial format (for example
  clipart-like illustrations), so they scale gracefully in slide decks or on websites.</li></ul><img
