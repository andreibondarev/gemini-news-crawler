content: '<p>When using a service like Google Cloud <a href="https://cloud.google.com/workflows/">Workflows</a>,
  in particular as your workflows get bigger, it can be difficult to understand what’s
  going on under the hood. With multiple branches, step jumps, iterations, and also
  parallel branches and iterations, if your workflow fails during an execution, until
  now, you had to check the execution status, or go deep through the logs to find
  more details about the failed step.</p><p>I have good news for you! Workflows recently
  added some deeper introspection capability: you can now <a href="https://cloud.google.com/workflows/docs/debug-steps">view
  the history of execution steps</a>. From the Google Cloud console, you can see the
  lists of steps, and see the logical flow between them. The usual workflow visualisation
  will also highlight in green the successful steps, and in red the failed one. Of
  course, it is also possible to make a curl call to get the JSON of the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/workflows/docs/debug-steps#list-entries">list
  of executed steps</a>.</p><p>Let’s have a look!</p><p>In the console, when you click
  on an execution, in the summary tab, you&#39;ll see not only the failed step, but
  also the nice workflow graph colored green and red:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*xomRWaQkCtyo6N5S.png"
  /></figure><p>That way, you know which path the execution followed, in a visual
  manner. But you can also see the actual list of steps executed, with more details,
  by clicking on the steps tab:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/888/0*rgzpqpjUpJ3YmsD8.png"
  /></figure><p>From this table, the filter will let you further refine particular
  type of steps you’d like to investigate, or visualise the steps of a subworkflow
  only, etc.</p><p>This is a nice improvement to the developer experience, and for
  your ops team, to better understand what happens during your workflow executions!
  Feel free to read more about this new capabability in the documentation about <a
  href="https://cloud.google.com/workflows/docs/debug-steps">viewing the history of
  execution steps</a>.</p><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href="https://glaforge.dev/posts/2023/12/22/visualize-and-inspect-workflows-executions/"><em>https://glaforge.dev</em></a><em>
