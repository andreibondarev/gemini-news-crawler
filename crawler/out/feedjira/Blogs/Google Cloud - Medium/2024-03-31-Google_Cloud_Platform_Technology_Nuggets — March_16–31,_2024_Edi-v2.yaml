  10 days away from the biggest Google Cloud Event of the year and the excitement
  is building up. This year, the event is expected to have a large number of technical
  sessions, based on the feedback received last year.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*QCWF8kgUU95aY0HA.jpg"
  /></figure><p>Several blog posts have started to highlight key sessions to attend
  from the respective areas: Networking, Dev Practitioners and more. Even if you are
  not there at the conference, these posts are good reference points to start building
  out sessions that you would like to watch once they are posted online.</p><p>Here
  are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Dev Connect at Next ’24</strong>: This is one
  of the key themes of the conference and the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/dev-connect-at-next24">post</a>

  more come together.</li><li><strong>Networking Sessions</strong>: 12 must attend
  networking and network security sessions at Next ’24. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/networking-session-preview-at-next24">post</a>.</li></ul><p>If
  you are into managing IT, then there is a constant pressure to streamline your infrastructure,
  manage it seamlessly and keep costs at a minimum. Right, isn’t it? An interesting
  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/breakout-sessions-for-it-pros-at-next24">post</a>
  highlights top 5 questions IT pros have been asking ranging from reducing costs,
  evaluating reliability of cloud providers, AI infrastructure, scalability and control
  requirements and more. The post further highlights the sessions where these questions
  are likely to get answered. Build out that agenda, I tell you.</p><h3>Infrastructure</h3><p>Forrester
  Research has recognized Google as a Leader in The Forrester Wave™: AI Infrastructure
  Solutions, Q1 2024. Google received the highest scores of any vendor evaluated in
  both Current Offering and Strategy categories in the report. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure-modernization/google-named-a-leader-in-the-forrester-wave-ai-infrastructure-solutions-q1-2024">post</a>
  and download the <a href="https://inthecloud.withgoogle.com/forrester-2024-ai-infra-wave/dl-cd.html?_ga=2.73419927.-428458833.1709094666&amp;_gac=1.195768030.1710843694.CjwKCAjwzN-vBhAkEiwAYiO7oHLj_RGrKSAo4oJDQU2SjU77HFVCySA9Xf8sfel4d3tEe32CenfQghoCEcAQAvD_BwE&amp;_gl=1*1t5omrr*_ga*NDI4NDU4ODMzLjE3MDkwOTQ2NjY.*_ga_WH2QY8WWF5*MTcxMTg3Njc5MS4yLjEuMTcxMTg3OTIwMi4wLjAuMA..">report</a>.</p><figure><img

  /></figure><p>NVIDIA NeMo is an open-source, end-to-end platform purpose-built for
  developing custom, enterprise-grade generative AI models. Looking to train models
  on Google Kubernetes Engine (FGKE) using NVIDIA accelerated computing and NVIDIA
  NeMo framework? Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/gke-and-nvidia-nemo-framework-to-train-generative-ai-models">blog
  post</a> also discusses a reference architecture that highlights the major components,
  tools and common services used to train the NeMo large language model using GKE.</p><figure><img
  alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*zk2fdOnHrZN2_Qj1.png" /></figure><p>Google
  Cloud VMware Engine is now integrated with Google Cloud NetApp Volumes. This availability
  enables customers to resize volumes without interruption. Separating out the scaling
  of compute and storage gives lots of flexiblity and cost control too. Check out
  the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure-modernization/google-cloud-netapp-volumes-integrates-with-vmware-engine">post</a>
  for more details.</p><p>Persistent Disk Asynchronous Replication (PD Async Replication)
  provides low recovery point objective (RPO) and low recovery time objective (RTO)
  block storage replication for cross-region active-passive disaster recovery (DR).
  It is a storage option that provides asynchronous replication of data between two
  regions. It can be used to manage replication for Compute Engine workloads at the
  infrastructure-level, instead of the workload-level. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/using-pd-async-replication-for-windows-server-disaster-recovery">blog
  post</a> with an example of how it works.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*iSe8yCNZwpzG6SXr.png"
  /></figure><h3>Customers</h3><p>VPC service Controls (VPC-SC) is a foundational
  security control that creates an isolation perimeter around managed cloud resources
  and networks. Via granular ingress and egress rules, you can selectively approve
  access across perimeter boundaries and play a key role in preventing data exfiltration.
  Consider CommerzBank, a leading German bank, that is a trusted partner to approx.
  26000 corporate client groups and 11 million private and small business customers.
  With the shift from IP addresses to API endpoints, a new approach was needed to
  address data sharing and movement needs. Especially around data sharing, CommerzBank
  had some clear criteria to evaluate any solution and VPC-SC met all these requirements.
  Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/customers/how-commerzbank-safeguards-its-data-with-vpc-service-controls">post</a>
  to learn more.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*PsWNx1LNe_XuC3GQ.png"
  /></figure><p>In another interesting customer case study, consider that of Palo
  Alto Networks. Their solid growth coupled with mergers and acquisitions had lead
  to more than 170,000 projects on Google Cloud. They did a large exercise a few years
  back around labelling that helped that identify the team, owner, cost center and
  environment for these projects (95% coverage). But the final 5% proved to be a challenge
  till they achieved that with BigQuery ML, which is the built-in machine learning
  feature in BigQuery. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-palo-alto-networks-uses-bigquery-ml">post</a>.</p><h3>Containers
  and Kubernetes</h3><p>Managing the growth of your GKE clusters required that you
  had insights into each specific limits like Nodes per cluster, Noder per node pool,
  pods per cluster and more. Your task just got easier with the introduction of directly
  monitoring and setting alerts for crucial scalability limits. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gke-gets-new-quota-monitoring-feature">post</a>
  for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*8X7HfXAqrPH2RIRz.png"
  /></figure><p>Ray, an open-source Python framework designed for scaling and distributing
  AI workloads is gaining widespread acceptance. While you can run Ray deployments
  on VMs, the traditional challenges that come with running workloads on your own
  on VMs i.e. resource efficiency and managing infrastructure come up. A suggested
  alternative is to deploy Ray on GKE with KubeRay, an open-source Kubernetes operator
  that simplifies Ray deployment and management. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/the-benefits-of-using-gke-for-running-ray-ai-workloads">post</a>
  that dives into the details on why running Ray on GKE would be the best way for
  you to go forward.</p><p>Continuing with Ray, are you running Ray on Google Kubernetes
  Engine (GKE)? Here is an essential blog post to read to run Ray securely on GKE.
  The post delves into areas that you need to address to harden your Ray installation
  on GKE and a solid summarization of best practices vis-a-vis Kubernetes and GKE
  constructs like namespaces, RBAC, NetworkPolicy and more. Safer defaults for running
  Ray with Kubernetes using KubeRay is a focus area and <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-on-gke/blob/main/ray-on-gke/README.md">Terraform
  templates</a> are available to spin up a multi-team environment with sample security
  configurations.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*WY1oRpGnazhikqte.jpg"
  /></figure><p>The final piece on Ray is that of Kueue, a cloud-native queueing system
  that provides advanced scheduling for Ray applications on GKE. Check out this <a
  href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/using-kuberay-and-kueue-to-orchestrate-ray-applications-in-gke">blog
  post</a> that shows how KubeRay and Kueue work together to achieve the same.</p><figure><img
  alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*q1spCntYfLdXRIC5.png" /></figure><p>Speak
  of training AI models and the need for NVIDIA GPUs comes up regularly. GKE is probably
  one of the best choices available to deploy, scale and manage custom ML platforms.
  In an added boost, GKE can now automatically install NVIDIA GPU drivers. This process
  was manually done before and the automatic installation now even allows for the
  drivers to be precompiled for the GKE node, which can reduce the time it takes for
  GPU nodes to startup. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gke-can-now-automatically-install-nvidia-gpu-drivers">post</a>

  /></figure><p>Stanford’s Brain Inferencing Laboratory explore motor systems neuroscience
  and neuroengineering applications. The relevant data for their research is obtained
  from experiments on preclininal models and human clinical studies. This data is
  handled via a complex platform that they have setup for standardized analyses and
  adhoc analyses. The components of the architecture include Containers, Git, CI/CD
  and compute clusters, specifically GKE running in Autopilot mode. Check out the
  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/stanford-team-uses-devops-tools-to-manage-research-data">blog

  /></figure><h3>Identity and Security</h3><p>This edition is heavy with security
  updates and let’s begin with zero-day vulnerabilities but what does that mean? A
  zero-day vulnerability is a security flaw in an application or operating system
  that has not been discovered, and there is no defense or patch for it. Did you know
  Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Mandiant showed 97 zero-day vulnerabilities
  were exploited in 2023. Is that an improvement over 2022 or 2021. Find about this
  and more in this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/2023-zero-day-trends">post</a>.</p><p>You
  must have heard about Assured Workloads, which allows companies to run regulated
  workloads in several Google Cloud’s global regions. Consider the requirement then
  for your organization to adhere to compliance requirements in more than one geographic
  region, how do you then use Assured Workloads to create regulatory boundaries using
  a folder structure? Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-to-set-compliance-controls-for-your-google-cloud-organization">post</a>.</p><figure><img
  alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YXPQRu5G853XXc3MRAue6Q.png"
  /></figure><p>In Google Cloud, we have the Organization resource right at the top
  in hierarchy. With the creation of this resource, you get access to Organization
  Policy Service. As part of a new release, a set of organization policies have been
  released that enforce the need to fix potentially insecure postures. These policies
  scan across IAM, Storage and Essential Contacts. For e.g. a few of the policies
  at the IAM level include disabling service account key creation, disabling service
  account key upload and more. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-stronger-default-org-policies-for-our-customers">post</a>
  to learn more of these policies that are available to all customers who are creating
  organization resources and for existing customers, who already have done that, these
  policies are available with no change required.</p><p>Cloud Armor plays an important
  role in enabling organizations to create a comprehensive DDOS mitigation strategy
  for their applications. One of the capabilities that plays a key role is that of
  rate-limiting via which you can curtail traffic to backend resources based on request
  volume. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-to-improve-resilience-to-ddos-attacks-with-cloud-armor-advanced-rate-limiting-capabilities">post</a>
  that highlights the rate-limiting features of Cloud Armor, the two types of actions
  available for rate-based rules (Throttle, Rate-based ban), planning your rate limiting
  deployment and more.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gUDRcmgcFoTaX_s0.png"
  /></figure><p>Handling sensitive data vis-a-vis security, privacy and compliance
  is an essential requirement for any application handling customer data. Discovery
  Service, that is part of Google Cloud’s Sensitive Data Protection helps to identify
  where Sensitive Data resides, which is the first step. Cloud SQL is now supported
  by the Discovery Service. Earlier it supported BigQuery and BigLake. Check out the
  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/expanding-sensitive-data-protection-to-make-it-easier-to-protect-data-in-cloud-sql">post</a>

  /></figure><p>Software Supply Chain attacks are common and organizations need to
  bring in strict controls, especially when they modern applications have heavy dependency
  on open source software. Check out this joint <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-to-choose-a-known-trusted-supplier-for-open-source-software">blog
  post</a> from Citi and Google, on common open source attack vectors and 3 main criteria
  to evaluate an OSS vendor.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*s38cJUiBW3x3vtTq.png"
  /></figure><p>Security will continue to be a big topic at Cloud Next ’24. The 2nd
  CISO bulletin for March 2024 drops a hint on key security topics and discussion
  to expect at the conference. In an earlier edition, we had covered the intersection
  of Gen AI and Security and the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-get-ready-for-next-24-what-you-need-to-know">post</a>
  seems to point towards that and of course, multiple other security areas that will
  receive attention during the event. The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-easing-the-psychological-burden-of-leadership">first
  CISO bulletin for March</a> this month, focused on psychological resilience in cybersecurity
  leadership.</p><p>To end the security updates, a slightly different area this time
  but nevertheless an important one. Data shows that Knowledge workers spend an average
  of 63% of their productive time in the browser and nearly half (48%) of all business-critical
  applications are now browser-based and more. Given this, organizations would be
  served well to consider an enterprise ready browser like Chrome Enterprise. Check
  out a recent report by Enterprise Strategy Group, titled “ <a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/esg-security-report-2023/">Assessing
  Enterprise Browser Market Dynamics: Why Organizations Are Turning to Enterprise
  Browsers to More Effectively Secure Modern Work Styles,</a>” and the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/chrome-enterprise/optimize-security-and-productivity-starting-with-the-browser-insights-from-new-report">blog
