content: <p>The day before they died, Nex Benedict, a nonbinary 16-year-old from Owasso,
  Oklahoma, said they got &#x201C;jumped&#x201D; at school and ended up in the hospital
  emergency room.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s according to text messages they sent to a family
  member, <a href="https://www.fox23.com/news/family-member-shares-messages-sent-by-16-year-old-owasso-student-day-before-death/article_a08a9600-d069-11ee-a555-a721a9701cad.html"
  target="_blank">shared with Fox23</a>.&#xA0;</p> <p>Nex told the unidentified recipient
  of their text messages that they&#x2019;d been getting bullied by three other students.
  &#x201C;I got tired of it so I poured some water on them,&#x201D; Benedict wrote.
  &#x201C;All 3 came after me.&#x201D; They said that they were &#x201C;okay&#x201D;
  after being in the ER, had scrapes and bruises, and had been given an injection
  to help with pain.</p> <p>&#x201C;If I&#x2019;m still dizzy and nauseous in the
  morning I might have a concussion,&#x201D; they wrote.&#xA0;</p> <p>The next day,
  on Feb. 8, Benedict was rushed back to the hospital by their grandmother, who they
  lived with, and died. The state medical examiner has yet to release their cause
  of death. Owasso police detectives say they are committed to conducting a thorough
  investigation of Benedict&#x2019;s death, and are currently awaiting the autopsy
  report and toxicology results.&#xA0;</p> <p>LGBTQ press started raising the alarm
  about Benedict&#x2019;s death over the weekend after a local news outlet, KJRH,
  <a href="https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/police-investigating-16-year-old-owasso-students-death"
  target="_blank">published an interview</a> with an unnamed family friend claiming
  that the teen had been assaulted by older female students in the girls&#x2019; bathroom.&#xA0;</p>
  <p>Those outlets flagged an ominous potential link between Benedict&#x2019;s death
  and the ongoing attacks on Oklahoma&#x2019;s LGBTQ citizens.</p> <p>The far-right
  account Libs of TikTok has repeatedly mounted harassment campaigns against school
  districts nationwide, including in Oklahoma. A queer teacher from the Owasso School
  District resigned in 2022 after they were targeted by Libs of TikTok over their
  social media videos expressing support for the LGBTQ community.&#xA0;</p> <p>Libs
  of TikTok&#x2019;s harassment campaigns have been <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvj5dq/schools-report-bomb-threats-following-libs-of-tiktok-anti-lgbtq-posts"
  target="_blank">correlated with violent threats</a> against those school districts.
  And, earlier this year, Libs of TikTok founder Chaya Raichik was appointed to the
  Oklahoma Library Media Advisory Committee, where she will &#x201C;make schools safer&#x201D;
  by removing LGBTQ-inclusive books.&#xA0;</p> <p>And in 2022, a bill went into effect
  that mandated Oklahoma schools have multiple occupancy bathrooms for the exclusive
  use of either male or female sex, as designated by their birth certificates&#x2014;barring
  schools from creating gender-neutral restrooms, and forcing trans kids to use bathrooms
  that are inconsistent with their identities.&#xA0;</p> <p>The unnamed family friend
  also claimed, in the interview with KJRH, that the school had failed to administer
  timely medical assistance to Benedict, despite the fact that they were unable to
  walk to the nurse&#x2019;s office. (Those claims have since been removed from an
  updated version of the story).&#xA0;</p> <p>In response to the growing uproar over
  Benedict&#x2019;s death and speculation that the school acted negligently in response
  to the altercation, the Owasso Police Department and the Owasso Public School District
  put out separate statements on Tuesday night.&#xA0;</p> <p>Owasso Public School
  District <a href="https://www.owassops.org/apps/news/article/1887342" target="_blank">dismissed
  accusations of negligence</a> as the result of &#x201C;misinformation.&#x201D; It
  said the altercation lasted less than two minutes and was broken up by other students
  and a staff member who was supervising outside.&#xA0;</p> <p>It also asserted that
  all students who were involved &#x201C;walked under their own power&#x201D; to the
  assistant principal&#x2019;s office and the nurse&#x2019;s office, and that district
  administrators took statements from all students who were involved or witnessed
  the altercation, and contacted the respective parents or guardians of those involved.&#xA0;</p>
  <p>The school district says that all students were assessed by a school nurse, per
  district protocols. &#x201C;While it was determined that ambulance service was not
  required, out of an abundance of caution, it was recommended to one parent that
  their student visit a medical facility for further examination,&#x201D; they wrote.&#xA0;</p>
  <p>Parents and guardians of students involved in the altercation were also told
  that they could file a police report if they wanted to, per district protocols,
  according to the statement.</p> <p>The Owasso Police Department said that they were
  only notified of the altercation when they were summoned to a local hospital later
  that day, and the responding school resource officer took information for a report.&#xA0;</p>
  <p>On Tuesday, Nex Benedict&#x2019;s mother Sue Benedict updated a GoFundMe with
  a statement apologizing for failing to initially use their chosen name.&#xA0;</p>
  <p>&#x201C;We are sorry for not using their name correctly and as parents we were
  still learning the correct forms. Please do not judge us as Nex was judged, please
  do not bully us for our ignorance on the subject,&#x201D; she wrote. &#x201C;Nex
  gave us that respect and we are sorry in our grief that we overlooked them.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>
  <p>Sue Benedict added that their headstone will reflect Nex&#x2019;s chosen name,
  and the rest of the donations will go to &#x201C;other children dealing with the
  right to be who they are, in Nex Benedict&#x2019;s name.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>
