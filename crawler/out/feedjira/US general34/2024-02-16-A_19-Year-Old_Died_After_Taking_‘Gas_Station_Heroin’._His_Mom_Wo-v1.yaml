content: <p>Kristi Terry keeps replaying the last time she saw her son Johnathon Morrison
  alive.</p> <p>The 19-year-old scholarship student came into her bedroom on the night
  of Feb. 20, 2019 and asked if it was OK if he cooked some pizza rolls; he didn&apos;t
  want to hog them from his younger sister, who was a fussy eater.</p> <p>Terry, 41,
  and her husband found it odd that he was asking permission.</p> <p>&#x201C;We were
  like &#x2018;you don&#x2019;t have to ask to cook something,&quot; she said. In
  hindsight, she wishes she&#x2019;d gotten up to see if he was feeling alright. She
  wonders if he was feeling sick at that point and was trying to settle his stomach
  with food.</p> <p>The next morning Terry and her 15-year-old daughter found Morrison
  unresponsive in his bedroom in Trafford, Alabama. Paramedics spent an hour trying
  to revive him, but they couldn&apos;t. Next to his body was a half-eaten plate of
  pizza rolls and a nearly empty bottle of tianeptine pills, an unapproved drug known
  as &#x201C;gas station heroin&#x201D; because of its addictive effects on some users.</p>
  <p>Morrison&#x2019;s cause of death is asphyxia due to aspiration of gastric contents&#x2014;meaning
  he choked on his vomit&#x2014;and is considered accidental, according to his autopsy
  report, which VICE News has obtained. But the high level of tianeptine he had in
  his system was similar to the level found in another reported tianeptine fatality
  in which no other drugs were detected, the medical examiner wrote.</p> <div class="article__media"><img

  <p>His death is one of the few rare fatal overdoses that&#x2019;s been linked to
  tianeptine, a drug that is&#xA0; sold at gas stations and convenience stores around
  the U.S. as well as online, often illegally marketed as a dietary supplement or
  cognitive booster. Tianeptine is a tricyclic antidepressant that is used as medication
  in over 60 countries around the world, but it is not approved by the Food and Drug
  Administration for medical use in the U.S., so the versions sold here are unregulated.
  While at least a dozen states have banned tianeptine, it remains federally unscheduled.</p>
  <p>Because it also hits opioid receptors in the brain, it can produce euphoria and
  pain relief. Many users have told VICE News tianeptine&#x2019;s effects were similar
  to prescription opioids at first, but were quickly replaced with brutal withdrawal
  symptoms including insomnia, shakes, nausea, and anxiety. It&#x2019;s also been
  linked to seizures and hospitalizations.</p> <p>But Morrison, a theater and business
  student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, didn&#x2019;t know any of that.</p>
  <p>He stumbled upon tianeptine by chance when he popped into a gas station in search
  of medication to relieve his migraine, according to his mom. The gas station didn&#x2019;t
  have Excedrin, but an employee there offered Morrison a bottle of pills called Tianaa,
  a popular brand of tianeptine.</p> <p>&#x201C;He had no clue what he was taking,&#x201D;
  said Terry. &#x201C;They told him that it was all natural, herbal, and that it was
  like a powerful Tylenol.&#x201D;</p> <div class="article__embed article__embed--vice"

  <p>So Morrison took it like Tylenol, popping a couple at a time over the next few
  hours. In the morning, Terry and her teenage daughter went to check on Morrison
  after his boss sent a concerned text saying he hadn&#x2019;t turned in a report.
  They found him lying flat on his bed. While it seemed like he was making a snoring
  noise, he wasn&#x2019;t breathing.</p> <p>Just three of the 15 tianeptine pills
  in the bottle remained, Terry said.</p> <p>VICE News has left messages with MT Brands,
  a Florida-based company that makes Tianaa, but has not yet received a response.</p>
  <p>The degree to which tianeptine toxicity may have contributed to Morrison&#x2019;s
  death, &#x201C;either directly due to the toxic effects of the drug or indirectly
  by potentially reducing his seizure threshold, remains uncertain,&#x201D; the autopsy
  said. His system had therapeutic amounts of a couple of prescription drugs he was
  taking for his migraines as well as an anti-seizure medication, though Terry said
  he&#x2019;d only had two seizures in his life.</p> <p>Dr. Ryan Marino, medical director
  of toxicology and addiction medicine at University Hospitals in Cleveland, said
  it&#x2019;s common for people to vomit and aspirate during drug overdoses because
  they &#x201C;lose higher functioning.&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x201C;A helpful comparison
  is alcohol,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s pretty hard to die from drinking
  alcohol in one night or one sitting. But obviously people can throw up and have
  bad things happen.&#x201D;</p> <p>He said it&#x2019;s not clear that tianeptine
  causes overdoses by causing people to stop breathing, which is the case for opioids
  like fentanyl. But he cautioned there&#x2019;s not enough data yet on high levels
  of tianeptine in humans to draw strong conclusions about its toxicity.</p> <div

  consumer <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/tianeptine" target="_blank">alerts</a>
  about tianeptine in the last few months, said it has received two tianeptine-related
  death reports since 2015. The agency also said poison control center cases about
  tianeptine exposure increased from 11 total cases between 2000 and 2013 to 151 cases
  in 2020 alone. A 2018 <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30149933/" target="_blank">paper</a>
  analyzing tianeptine deaths worldwide showed that the ones that didn&#x2019;t involve
  other drugs were tied to respiratory depression or cardiac arrhythmias.</p> <p>Despite
  the fact that deaths are rare, tianeptine users have still reported adverse health
  reactions to the drug.</p> <p>Chris Ricks, who lives in Mobile, Alabama, was hospitalized
  for a week in 2021 after taking four bottles of Zazas, another popular tianeptine
  brand. He was found &#x201C;urinating and defecating everywhere in the house,&#x201D;
  according to a hospital report seen by VICE News, before being admitted into an
  intensive care unit.</p> <p>&#x201C;I just remember being out of it, I don&apos;t
  know what was going on,&#x201D; he said, noting that in hospital he required benzodiazepines
  to stop him from ripping out his IV.</p> <p>Ricks has been sober from tianeptine
  since he was discharged in March 2021. At the height of his addiction, he was taking
  eight bottles a day, spending $80,000 on them in one year.</p> <p>&#x201C;Within
  a month of taking those I looked in the mirror and said &#x2018;You&#x2019;re either
  headed back to rehab or death,&#x2019;&#x201D; he told VICE News.</p> <div class="article__media"><img

  </div></div> <p>After Morrison died, Terry was determined to get tianeptine banned
  in Alabama.</p> <p>She testified at a state senate healthcare committee in February
  2020.</p> <p>&#x201C;He was just the light of my life and he was my best friend,&#x201D;
  Terry said, showing a photo of her son to the committee, according to an audio recording
  of the hearing obtained by VICE News.</p> <p>Her friend explained that Terry had
  been bedridden with post-traumatic stress disorder since finding Morrison.</p> <p>Also
  at the hearing was James Morrissette, CEO and founder of MT Brands. He said his
  tianeptine products were promoted as being for stress and anxiety relief, but &#x201C;it
  has taken a direction where people are beginning to abuse the product&#x201D; or
  use it as a &#x201C;cessation product for opiates.&#x201D;</p> <p>Morrissette said
  while Terry&#x2019;s story was heartbreaking, he supported stronger regulation over
  banning tianeptine, including increased age limits for customers. He has also <a
  href="https://www.headquest.com/mt-brands-taking-the-high-road/" target="_blank">accused</a>
  other tianeptine manufacturers of making subpar products.</p> <p>&#x201C;There are
  other people that are benefiting from this product. And to just turn around and
  start banning products without having solid meaning behind it, where does it stop?&#x201D;
  he said at the hearing.</p> <p>A year later, Alabama became the second state to
  ban tianeptine. Florida, Arkansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Tennessee, Georgia,
  Ohio, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Indiana, have also banned it.</p> <p>In January,
  citing <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy3vvq/gas-station-heroin-tianeptine-zaza-pills"
  target="_blank">VICE News&#x2019; previous reporting</a>, a group of five members
  of Congress <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgwpd7/gas-station-heroin-fda-congress"
  target="_blank">wrote a letter to the FDA</a> asking the agency to &#x201C;to take
  immediate action to research and provide guidance on tianeptine use,&#x201D; including
  working with the Drug Enforcement Administration to determine if it should be federally
  scheduled.</p> <p>But bans can have unintended causes, including leading people
  back to using illicit drugs, especially because there&#x2019;s no <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7bp5x/people-are-turning-to-reddit-to-get-through-gas-station-heroin-withdrawal"
  target="_blank">clear-cut detox protocol</a> for coming off of tianeptine. Three
  former users previously told VICE News their tianeptine use led them back to using
  street drugs including fentanyl and crack cocaine.</p> <div class="article__embed

  none;margin:0px" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> <p>In an email, an FDA spokesperson
  told VICE News it urges consumers not to use any tianeptine product and reiterated
  that it is not approved for any medical use.</p> <p>&#x201C;The FDA will continue
  to take regulatory actions and alert consumers of safety issues related to tianeptine
  products,&#x201D; the statement said.</p> <p>Terry said it makes her &#x201C;sick&#x201D;
  that there are many Americans who can still easily purchase the drug.</p> <p>She
  said her son, who had the &#x201C;biggest smile and dimples&#x201D; had been saving
  up for a vintage Mercedes or BMW when he died. Instead, that money paid for his
  headstone.</p> <p>&#x201C;I do feel like Johnathon&#x2019;s story is what got it
  banned in Alabama. I really do,&#x201D; she said.&#xA0; &#x201C;The senators and
  everybody had to look at my son&#x2019;s picture.&#x201D;</p>
