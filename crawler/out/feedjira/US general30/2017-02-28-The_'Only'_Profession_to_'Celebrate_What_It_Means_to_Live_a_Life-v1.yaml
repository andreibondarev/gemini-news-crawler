  praised</a> Viola Davis’s Oscars speech for being memorable without being explicitly
  political—for simply talking about her job in a moving and well-written way. Twitter
  quickly let me know I missed something. On social media and conservative-leaning
  news sites, Davis’s speech had in fact sparked outrage.</p>\n\n<p>After explaining
  that she felt her mission was to “exhume … the stories of the people who dreamed
  big and never saw those dreams to fruition, people who fell in love and lost,” Davis
  said this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I became an artist—and thank God I did—because
  we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<aside
  class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"></aside>\n\n<p>This claim
  has become one of the discussion items of the right-wing internet following the
  Oscars ceremony. “Art is wonderful; art is enriching; art can connect us with each
  other,” writes Ben Shapiro <a href=\"http://www.dailywire.com/news/13885/viola-davis-gives-self-important-tearful-speech-we-ben-shapiro\">at
  <em>Daily Wire</em></a>. “But the utter arrogance of stating that artists are ‘the
  only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life’ is astounding. How
  about doctors? How about stay-at-home mothers, who help shape lives rather than
  pursuing their own career interests? How about morticians? How about pretty much
  everybody in a free market economy, giving of themselves to others to improve lives?”</p>\n\n<p>Variants
  of that sentiment have ricocheted online, with Davis sometimes misquoted as though
  she’d said only “actors” celebrate what it means to live a life, or, worse, are
  the only ones who “know” what it means to live a life.</p>\n\n<p>Are people right
  to be offended? Did she say artists are better than anyone else? Reading her words
  literally, within the context of her speech, and extending her the slightest benefit
  of the doubt, it’s hard to see backlash against Davis as anything other than a symptom
  of our overblown culture wars.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone might “celebrate what it means to
  live a life” in their own personal ways, but for whom is that a primary function
  of their profession? Artists, definitely. Clergy, maybe. Doctors <em>save</em> lives
  rather than celebrating them, and it doesn’t denigrate them to say so. Stay-at-home
  parents <em>help</em> others, and Davis might even agree that that’s more noble,
  important, and essential than “celebrating” the meaning of life.</p>\n\n<p>Her point
  was simply that artists serve a specific role in telling stories about the human
  experience, and that she’s glad she’s a part of that.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, she could
  have edited herself to make a less controversial, though arguably less interesting<strong>,</strong>
  statement. If she’d simply said, “I became an artist—and thank God I did—because
  we celebrate what it means to live a life,” complaints may have been harder to come
  by. The “only” highlights a specific way that artists are special, but it also is
  a dogwhistle to anyone holding strong resentment about Hollywood elitism and condescension.
  And there’s rarely been a better time to air such resentment than right now.</p>\n\n<aside
  class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\">Artists are now treated like candidates—expected
  to choose their words not for truth but for politics.</aside>\n\n<p>On the right,
  reflexive disgust for the entertainment industry has taken on new fervor under Donald
  Trump. During the <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/02/27/fox-friends-provides-laughably-bad-analysis-of-la-la-land-vs-moonlight-oscar-flub.html\"><em>Fox
  and Friends</em> after the Oscars</a>, the snafu whereby <em>La La Land</em> mistakenly
  was announced as Best Picture was spun by Steve Doocy as, “Hollywood got the election
  wrong, and last night Hollywood got the Oscars wrong.” Guest Tucker Carlson agreed
  but added that <em>Moonlight</em> “had to win” because the moralizing, politically
  correct establishment willed it to. Yes, the Oscars were both an out-of-touch catastrophe
  and an insidiously rigged game.</p>\n\n<p>Donald Trump has given his own interpretation
  of the Academy’s screwup: “I think they were focused so hard on politics that they
  didn’t get the act together at the end,” he told <em>Breitbart</em>, as if the PricewaterhouseCoopers
  accountant who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/business/media/pwc-oscars-best-picture.html\">handed
  Warren Beatty the wrong envelope</a> did so because he’d been cackling too hard
  at Kimmel <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/liveblogs/2017/02/2017-oscars/517761/14940/\">tweeting</a>
  the president “u up?”  </p>\n\n<p>Liberals may groan at Trump taking credit for
  his critics making a logistical mistake. But, of course, both sides see a lot of
  politics in entertainment these days: See <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/did-the-oscars-just-prove-that-we-are-living-in-a-computer-simulation\">all
  the takes</a> making like Doocy and comparing the end of the Oscars to election
  night.</p>\n\n<p>To many viewers on Sunday, Davis’s speech seemed remarkable for
  how it nearly transcended partisan fray and just passionately talked about acting.
  But one word—“only”—was enough to make her a culture-war litmus test. Maybe she
  wanted to pick a fight about art’s place in society, or maybe she was simply portraying
  her profession as she genuinely sees it. Either way, it was a defiant move in an
  era where artists are increasingly held to the same standards as candidates for
  office: expected to choose their words not for truth but for politics.</p>\n"
