  at the Oscars may have been <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/liveblogs/2017/02/2017-oscars/517761/\">bizarre
  and shocking</a>, but in toppling expected favorite <em>La La Land</em>, Barry Jenkins’s
  film set a number of milestones. It’s the lowest-budgeted film to win the prize
  since Delbert Mann’s <em>Marty</em> in 1955; if adjusting for inflation, it’s the
  lowest ever. It’s the first movie centered on an LGBTQ character to be named Best
  Picture, and the first whose cast is entirely people of color. Beyond that, it’s
  incredible that <em>Moonlight</em> beat <em>La La Land</em> simply because the latter
  seemed like a film aimed at Academy voters—a well-made original musical about artistry
  and Hollywood dreams, shot through with nostalgia for the industry’s Golden Age.</p>\n\n<aside
  class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"></aside>\n\n<p>But maybe it
  shouldn’t be so surprising that <em>Moonlight </em>took Best Picture. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/10/moonlight-barry-jenkins-review/505409/\">It’s
  a stunning film</a>, but also in some ways one that fits a mold the Academy has
  been leaning toward in recent years. For decades, it was very unusual for the movie
  with the most awards of the night to lose the Best Picture race. But in recent years,
  that’s been the norm. For decades, splits between Best Picture and Best Director
  (as happened at last night’s Oscars) were a relative rarity; in the last 20 years,
  it’s happened 8 times. <em>Moonlight</em> is a unique film, and one that tells the
  kind of story the Academy Awards have largely ignored through its history—but it’s
  also the kind of smaller, more intimate tale that voters have started warming to.</p>\n\n<p><em>Moonlight</em>
  won three Academy Awards this year: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Mahershala
  Ali), and Best Adapted Screenplay for Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney. Last year’s
  Best Picture winner <em>Spotlight</em> took only two trophies, and in 2015, <em>Birdman
  </em>won four. The year before that, <em>12 Years a Slave </em>won three, as did
  <em>Argo </em>in 2013. In every case, there was another more opulent production
  that won at least as many trophies, if not more: <em>The Revenant</em>, <em>The
  Grand Budapest Hotel</em>, <em>Gravity</em>, and <em>Life of Pi</em>, respectively
  (with all but <em>Budapest </em>winning Best Director but not Best Picture). <em>La
  La Land</em> seems to belong to this new ticket-splitting norm, where voters chalk
  up a bunch of technical wins for the glitzy frontrunner, but give Best Picture to
  the more critically acclaimed, smaller production.</p>\n\n<p>Again, this is not
  to discount <em>Moonlight</em>’s game-changing triumph. Though movies like <em>Spotlight</em>
  and <em>Birdman</em> were independent works, they were made on a much bigger budget
  and distributed by more established indie wings of major studios (<em>Moonlight</em>’s
  distributor was A24, a company <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2015/09/profile_of_the_independent_film_distributor_a24_the_company_behind_spring.html\">founded
  only five years ago</a> that has quickly become one of the most respected names
  in American art cinema). Still, only one major studio has won Best Picture in the
  last decade—Warner Bros. (for <em>Argo </em>and <em>The Departed</em>). As Hollywood’s
  major production companies have tilted away from prestige films to focus more heavily
  on big tentpole franchises, the Best Picture nominations list is mostly filled with
  indie and “mid-major” companies, (with streaming service Amazon making <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/01/how-amazon-got-a-best-picture-oscar-nomination/514325/\">its
  own breakthrough</a> this year for <em>Manchester by the Sea</em>).</p>\n\n<p>If
  things had been already edging in this direction, then <em>Moonlight</em> might
  be the beginning of an even bigger sea change. Of this year’s nine Best Picture
  nominees, it is the lowest-grossing (having made $22 million in the fourth months
  since its release, behind the next lowest <em>Hell or High Water</em> with $27 million).
  The Oscars used to have a certain reverence for perfectly well reviewed films that
  broke out in a major way. It’s how consensus choices like <em>A Beautiful Mind</em>,
  <em>Gladiator</em>, <em>Braveheart, </em>and <em>Forrest Gump </em>took the prize
  over more acclaimed movies. <em>La La Land </em>fits that mold well—but that mold
  may have been broken.</p>\n\n<p>It helps that <em>Moonlight </em>was universally
  heralded, getting the kind of rapturous critical raves that come once in a generation,
  rather than once a year. It was also a beautifully made film on every level, attracting
  support from a wider swath of Academy branches (it was nominated for its music,
  cinematography, and editing along with the expected writing, acting, and directing
  nods). That’s crucial for a Best Picture win, because people from every Academy
  branch get to vote on the winners, and it’s what had kept smaller, less technically
  impressive indie movies from winning in the past. Perhaps next year the trophy will
  go to some big epic that hits at the box office, like Christopher Nolan’s <em>Dunkirk</em>,
  and this recent pattern will be upended. Either way, <em>Moonlight</em>’s win is
  shocking enough to be remembered forever. The thing to watch for now is if it’s
  a magical Oscars anomaly, or a sign of profound change for the Academy.</p>\n"

summary: The stunning film’s unexpected triumph is part of a larger trend toward more
  small and intimate projects for the Academy.
