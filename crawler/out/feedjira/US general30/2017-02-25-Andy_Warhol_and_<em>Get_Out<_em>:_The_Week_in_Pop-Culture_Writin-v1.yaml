  Years After His Death, Andy Warhol’s Spirit Is Still Very Much Alive</a><br />\nR.C.
  Baker | <i>The Village Voice</i><br />\n“How much responsibility does a mirror bear
  for whatever beauty or ugliness it beholds? Warhol loved both the heights and depths
  of American culture, and reflected it back at us through his work, which remains
  resonant to this day. Here is the spin he put on the concept of American exceptionalism
  in the 1985 <i>America</i> book: ‘Maybe you think it's so special that certain people
  shouldn't be allowed to live [here], or if they do live [here] that they shouldn't
  say certain things or have certain ideas.’”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bkmag.com/2017/02/22/rise-roxane-gay/\">The
  Rise of Roxane Gay</a><br />\nMolly McArdle | <em>Brooklyn Magazine</em><br />\n“Gay
  has been persistent and precise when so many others have not: She believes in a
  substantial variety of writers and writing that includes not only race and gender
  and sexuality but also class, ability, geography. She also takes as long and hard
  a look at herself as she does anyone else. When considering, in her 2010 <em>HTMLGiant</em>
  essay ‘A Profound Sense of Absence,’ whether or not she read diversely, Gay concludes:
  ‘I don’t, nor do I know how to.’”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/magazine/the-age-of-rudeness.html?partner=socialflow&amp;smid=tw-nytmag&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=3\">The
  Age of Rudeness</a><br />\nRachel Cusk | <em>The New York Times Magazine</em><br
  />\n“Are people rude because they are unhappy? Is rudeness like nakedness, a state
  deserving the tact and mercy of the clothed? If we are polite to rude people, perhaps
  we give them back their dignity; yet the obsessiveness of the rude presents certain
  challenges to the proponents of civilized behavior. It is an act of disinhibition:
  Like a narcotic, it offers a sensation of glorious release from jailers no one else
  can see.”</p>\n\n<aside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"></aside>\n\n<p><br
  />\n<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/frederickmckindra/nothingscarierthanbeingblackinamerica\">In
  <em>Get Out</em>, Racism Is the Horror Story Black People Try to Survive</a><br
  />\nFrederick McKindra | <em>BuzzFeed</em><br />\n“Horror films constantly reinforced
  the concept of the white body’s vulnerability, and subtly advised their audiences
  to treat only those bodies with concern. Meanwhile, for black characters, and by
  extension, black people, if no one ever saw you scream, tremble, or bleed, they
  never learned to see you as human. In the aughts, black characters in horror films
  were either disposable, not worth depicting at all, or rendered racial amnesiacs
  when it came to issues that would concern any black person in real life.”</p>\n\n<p><a

  Seijun Suzuki, an Absurdist Auteur in Hired-Gun Clothing</a><br />\nEmily Yoshida
  | <em>Vulture</em><br />\n“The Japanese film-production world was a kind of temporary
  Wild West, no longer locked into the hierarchical promotion system that brought
  up Ozu and Kurosawa. Suzuki rose up through the reshuffling almost by accident,
  but once he became a director, he made sure nobody forgot his name.”<br />\n<br
  />\n<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/harry-belafonte-and-the-social-power-of-song\">Harry
  Belafonte and the Social Power of a Song</a><br />\nAmanda Petrusich | <em>The New
  Yorker</em><br />\n“Belafonte was strikingly prescient about the ways in which taste
  could and would be politicized, and especially about how treacherous it is to confuse
  consumption with action. This seems, to me, to be an unspoken but profound hindrance
  to all popular rebellions: If a person reads the right authors, and buys the right
  records, and vouches for those preferences loudly and repeatedly, it can feel like
  all the necessary work has been done to align oneself with the proper causes.”<br
  />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.vox.com/culture/2017/2/7/14442410/jackie-kennedy-accent-natalie-portman\">Jackie
  Kennedy’s Strange, Elegant Accent, Explained by Linguists</a><br />\nAlex Abad-Santos
  | <em>Vox</em><br />\n“Merely reading that line doesn’t do justice to the voice
  Portman adopted for the role. If you’re not aware of how Jackie Kennedy spoke, listening
  to Portman’s Jackie is like the tingle of soda in your throat. It often feels familiar,
  but in certain spots it pops and jumps. The way she lops off the end of ‘bitter,’
  the funny hop in ‘artifact,’ the way she rolls through ‘remembered’—it’s like she’s
  invented her own unique way of speaking English.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/2985787/moonlight-forgotten-frequencies/\"><em>Moonlight</em>’s
  Forgotten Frequencies</a><br />\nDave Tompkins | <em>MTV News </em><br />\n“<em>Moonlight</em>'s
  score is part of this allowed emotional space, internalizing the Miami environment.
  (In terms of pressing bass to vinyl, wider spaces between the grooves make room
  for longer wavelengths and lower frequencies.) According to [Nicholas] Britell,
  the composer, everything in <em>Moonlight</em>’s score has at some point been pitched
  down and lived an alternate bass life before reaching your ears, whether you hear
  it or not.”</p>\n"
