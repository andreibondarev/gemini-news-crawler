  \   \n\n</figure>\n\n<p>Why do the girls of <em>Girls</em> act that way? That’s
  the question underlying five years of baffled cultural responses to Lena Dunham’s
  epic of questionable decisions, cruelty, narcissism, and grace. <em>Girls</em> has
  never given a straightforward answer to the question. Despite unflinching confessional
  dialogue and occasional backstory development and sharp cultural satire, Hannah
  Horvath and her friends still have an air of Athena, sprung into existence fully
  formed. Asking why these girls spill drinks and impulsively marry and vomit off
  of bunkbeds is like asking why anyone exists at all.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"callout-placeholder\"
  data-source=\"curated\"></aside>\n\n<p>This has made <em>Girls</em> unusual in a
  cultural landscape where the tragic flashback is the go-to decoder of individual
  motivation. To take two recent examples from HBO, <em>The Young Pope</em> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/the-young-pope-season-one-finale-hbo/516600/\">connected
  Pope Pious’s childhood abandonment</a> to his adult torment, and <em>Westworld</em>’s
  so-called “key insight” was that <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/12/westworld-finale-the-bicameral-mind-storytelling-fiction/509552/\">to
  be human is to remember suffering</a>. In society more broadly, ongoing dialogues
  about trauma, triggering, and privilege—dialogues that Dunham often wades into as
  a public figure—insist that personal history needs to be taken as seriously as present
  conduct does.</p>\n\n<p>On <em>Girls</em>, parental issues occasionally surface—Jessa’s
  flaky dad, Hannah’s closeted one, Marnie’s controlling mom—and brain chemistry came
  to the fore in Hannah’s OCD plot line. But sometimes it has seemed like the show
  wants to satirize the notion of explaining character through trauma. Once, Hannah
  recalled telling her mom that her babysitter touched her vagina at age 3—but added
  that she had probably been lying at it.<strong> </strong>At the Iowa Writer’s Workshop,
  her peers insisted her short story about violent sex must have been nonfiction from
  an abusive past<strong>;</strong> the joke was that it actually reflected her adventuresome
  present: “the time that I took a couple Quaaludes and asked my boyfriend to punch
  me in the chest.”</p>\n\n<p>This week’s<strong> </strong>sure-to-be-provocative
  episode “American Bitch”—posted to online platforms now and airing on HBO Sunday
  night—sharpened the show’s point of view on psychological cause and effect. In it,
  Hannah visits with a famous author, Chuck Palmer (Matthew Rhys), after writing an
  essay about accusations that he’d serially preyed on college-aged female fans. Chuck
  makes his case for innocence, Hannah relates some details from her past, and the
  two seem to come to an understanding—and then Chuck takes his penis out and presses
  it against Hannah. It’s a story of personal monstrousness and trauma, but it’s also
  a story about a system: a gender dynamic that ensures a common experience of degradation
  for women, whether in their pasts or in the present.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dropcap\">Chuck
  Palmer has a surprising amount in common with Hannah. His fussiness hints at OCD.
  He proposes that writers need stories more than anything else, echoing Hannah’s
  experiences-at-all-cost outlook throughout <em>Girls</em>. The two bond over their
  love of Philip Roth, agreeing that “you can’t let politics dictate what you read
  or who you fuck” (Chuck’s words). And most tellingly, Chuck professes to want to
  understand the person he’s talking to but constantly interrupts with his own observations—perhaps
  a sexist tic, but also a narcissistic one plenty familiar to <em>Girls</em> viewers.
  In all of these things, Dunham may be sketching some ideas about the intrinsic traits
  that make a writer.</p>\n\n<p>But most of their conversation is a clash of biographies.
  Chuck emphasizes his loneliness, his daughter’s depression, his ex-wife’s hostility,
  and the sadness of book-tour life. When Hannah suggests an inappropriate power balance
  in him hooking up with girls on the road, Chuck shoots back that the real imbalance
  is that “she looks like a Victoria’s Secret model and I didn’t lose my virginity
  till I was 25 and on Accutane.” He is the victim in this reading. The women complaining
  online are exploiting his fame and desperation as well as the power of the internet
  to amplify harmful claims.</p>\n\n<p>It appears that this version of events nearly
  persuades Hannah, who apologizes for having written something that upset Chuck.
  But the apology is colored by all the buttering-up that has come before. Chuck repeatedly
  tells her how smart he thinks she is. He gives her a signed copy of Roth’s<strong>
  </strong><em>When She Was Good. </em>And he claims that he invited her over to try
  and correct his true error with his accusers: not “pushing” enough to get to know
  them as people. When he then asks questions about her life, Hannah giggles and blithely<strong>
  </strong>answers.</p>\n\n<p>But during an earlier, tenser point in the conversation,
  Hannah relates a less happy bit of her history. In fifth grade, her English teacher
  Mr. Lasky took a liking to her based on her talent as a writer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>He
  liked me, he was impressed with me, I did like special creative writing, I wrote
  like a little novel or whatever. Sometimes, when he was talking to the class he
  would stand behind me and he’d rub my neck. Sometimes he’d rub my head, rustle my
  hair. And I didn’t mind. It made me feel special. It made me feel like someone saw
  me and they knew that I was going to grow up and be really, really particular. It
  also made kids hate me and put lasagna in my fucking backpack, but that’s a different
  story.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, last year I’m at a warehouse party in Bushwick, and this
  guy comes up to me and he’s like, “Horvath, we went to middle school together, East
  Lansing!” And I’m like, “Oh my god, remember how crazy Mr. Lasky’s class was? He
  was basically trying to molest me.”</p>\n\n<p>You know what this kid said? He looks
  at me in the middle of this fucking party like he’s a judge, and he goes, “That’s
  a very serious accusation Hannah.” And he walked away. And there I am and I’m just
  11 again, and I’m just getting my fucking neck rubbed. Because that stuff never
  goes away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If this is Hannah Horvath’s long-awaited revelation
  about her past, it’s a relatively mild<strong> </strong>one: no rape, no violence,
  just some neck rubbing in class. But the insidiousness of it is in how it fits a
  pattern of warped gender relations. Chuck is like Mr. Lanksy: an older, powerful
  man praising a younger woman’s<strong> </strong>intellectual talents—but also tying
  that praise to flesh. Hannah’s value as a writer and her value as a body were long
  ago swirled together by a gatekeeper, and Chuck did something very similar to the
  young would-be authors he had sex with. If they consented, what were they consenting
  to? A validation of their mind, or the notion that what really matters is their
  body?</p>\n\n<p>The trauma here is not merely <em>what</em> happened, either. It’s
  in how honest expressions of discomfort by women are met with hostility and invalidation
  by men on legalistic pretenses. Consent is hugely important, but the issue isn’t
  entirely a legal one in this case. It is a moral one, a social one, and an emotional
  one. Hannah doesn’t seem to want either Chuck or Mr. Lasky in jail. She just wants
  to tell the truth about a troubling, degrading dynamic, and she is told—both by
  the guy at the Bushwick party and by Chuck—that she is wrong to do so.</p>\n\n<aside
  class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\">The earlier trauma itself didn’t create the
  new one.</aside>\n\n<p>The sick twist is that the trauma has now been amplified
  and reenacted on Hannah for speaking out. Chuck flatters her, convinces her he’s
  no monster, and then unzips and thrusts against her without warning. For a moment,
  Hannah seems confused; for another moment, she seems to consider going along with
  it—she grabs him. Then she freaks out and screams at him.</p>\n\n<p>He gives her
  an evil grin. All the respect he had previously paid her has been rendered a joke.
  His praise of her mind was foreplay to the reminder that what he really liked was
  her body. And in Hannah’s moment of her considering whether to give in—for the rush,
  the faux validation, and the avoidance of conflict that would come with saying “yes”—she
  was in the same impossible situation as so many women before her.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dropcap\">As
  a public figure, Lena Dunham has written a lot about trauma, especially about how
  a rape in early adulthood has had a<a href=\"http://www.lennyletter.com/health/a716/one-of-a-kind/?src=nl&amp;mag=LEN&amp;list=nl_LEN_news&amp;date=021217\">
  concrete effect on her life over the years</a>. But she also, recently,<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/12/the-lena-dunham-cycle-of-internet-outrage/511388/\">
  apologized</a> for saying she “wished” she had had an abortion so as to help destigmatize
  the practice—a very inartful expression of the idea that a person and their worldview
  is not merely a result of biography.</p>\n\n<p><em>Girls</em> seems to be trying
  to reconcile the need to honor the past's influence on the present while recognizing
  that no individual's history is an island. Did the Mr. Lasky experience change Hannah
  forever? Maybe. He could be the reason why she wants “to write stories that make
  people feel less alone than [she] did,” the exact kind of story that brought her
  to Chuck’s apartment. But that earlier trauma, in itself, didn’t create the new
  one she experienced in this episode. Nor was it, theoretically, necessary for Hannah
  to have gone through what she went through in order to care about Chuck's accusers.</p>\n\n<p>Why
  is Chuck such a creep? <em>Girls</em> doesn’t say that it’s because of any specific
  circumstance in his past. It’s not just because he’s what he calls a “horny motherfucker.”
  It’s simply because he <em>can</em> be this way. Because he is successful and male,
  he can put women in spots like the one he put Hannah in. He can expect them to often
  consent, queasily or not. He can even expect that other men will tell the women
  not to complain about it later.</p>\n\n<p>What he can’t expect anymore, <em>Girls</em>
  suggests, is for the women to actually remain silent. In the final moments of the
  episode, Hannah watches Chuck’s daughter play flute. She alternates her gaze between
  the girl and her father, perhaps weighing the implications of what just happened
  and what she should do about it. If Hannah writes about his actions, she may hurt
  him in a way that harms his daughter. But she keeps staring at the girl. She may
  well be one day put in a situation like the one Hannah was just put in. She may
  already have been.</p>\n\n<p>As Hannah leaves, we see a handful of women walking
  the opposite direction up the sidewalk, and then turning to enter his building.
  It reads as symbolism: a nod to all of the women<strong> </strong>past and future
  who can relate to what Hannah just went through, as different as their individual
  backstories may be.</p>\n"
