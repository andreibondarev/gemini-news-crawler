  points of episode 10 of </em>The Bachelor <em>season 21.</em></b></p>\n\n<p>According
  to the fabricated lexicon of <em>The Bachelor</em>, the show’s characters do not
  participate in a mere televised dating competition. They have been brought together,
  instead, on an emotional adventure that the show refers to, infallibly, as “a journey.”</p>\n\n<p><em>The
  Bachelor</em>’s insistence on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces\">its
  own vague Campbelliness</a> is ironic for several reasons. The biggest is that,
  while the show does offer a kind of momentum—things proceed week after week, Rose
  Ceremony after Rose Ceremony, with romantic tensions inevitably mounting—its participants,
  for the most part, do very little in the way of their own development. There are
  characters, yes, but very few arcs. The Bachelor or Bachelorette in question might
  learn some things as the season proceeds, sure; for the most part, though, the contestants
  are who they are, and they stay who they are. The tensions come not as those contestants
  grow and change, but instead as their different facets are systematically revealed
  to the Bachelor(ette). Different sides of their personalities are glimpsed; people
  are kept around or kicked to the curb based on the facets of themselves that manifest
  as the Journey continues apace. <em>The Bachelor</em>, basically, is a show that
  offers a lot of movement, but very little evolution.</p>\n<!-- START \"MORE ON\"

  Praise of Corinne, <em>The Bachelor’</em>s Human Conspiracy Theory</a></p>\n\n<hr
  /></aside>\n<!-- END \"MORE ON\" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 -->\n\n<p>Which made Monday’s
  episode especially striking. First, because, at the Rose Ceremony at the episode’s
  outset, Nick “said goodbye” (another term of <em>Bachelor </em>art) to Corinne Olympios,
  the season’s appointed villain. Corinne, who is dramatic and zany and materialistic
  and Good TV in human form, had long been a front-runner both despite and because
  of her antics (as <em>SB Nation</em> <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/2017/2/14/14604780/the-bachelor-season-21-episode-7-recap-nick-viall\">summed
  it up</a> earlier this month, “Oh God, Corinne’s gonna win this whole dang thing,
  isn’t she?”). Her ouster on Monday, right before the Fantasy Suite dates, was a
  shock—to viewers of the show including, but definitely not limited to, <a href=\"http://www.glamour.com/story/the-bachelor-corinne-olympios-nick-viall-sent-her-home\">Corinne
  herself</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What was doubly striking about Corinne’s departure, though,
  was that she used the show’s elaborate farewell ritual to contradict <em>The Bachelor</em>’s
  dynamic stasis: While being broken up with by Nick and, by extension, Bachelor Nation,
  Corinne demonstrated that, against all odds, she had grown. As a person! Sort of!
  (I’d use another <em>Bachelor</em>ism here, but of course, for this kind of thing,
  there is none.)</p>\n\n<p><em>The Bachelor’</em>s traditional departure scene—Woman,
  Weeping Alone in a Limo—typically involves the said-goodbye-to contestant crying,
  wiping away mascara-tears, and discussing how much she wants—really, how <em>ready</em>
  she is—to “find love.” Not so Corinne. The woman who had spend the season defying
  the show’s long-established norms had one more trick up her faux-fur-covered sleeve.
  Corinne, Weeping Alone in a Limo, told the show’s invisible cameras not about how
  sad she was, but instead about … how changed she was. The season’s villain and cipher
  and punchline and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/01/in-praise-of-corinne-the-bachelors-human-conspiracy-theory/514217/\">living,
  breathing conspiracy theory</a> used her final moments within the <em>Bachelor</em>
  spotlight to talk about what she had taken away from her experience on the show.
  She used them to talk not about The Journey, but about her own.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"pullquote
  instapaper_ignore\">Corinne, in the end, did something that is rare and almost rebellious
  within <em>The Bachelor</em>’s gauzy confines: She learned a lesson.</aside>\n\n<p>It
  went like this: Nick did not call Corinne’s name at the New York City-based Rose
  Ceremony. He walked her out to the limo. “I’m sorry,” she told him, as they embraced.
  “I’m sorry if I ever did anything to make you upset.”</p>\n\n<p>He replied: “You
  never did! Listen, you never did anything wrong. Ever. You have nothing to regret.
  You have nothing to second guess. Look at me—nothing. Not a thing. You need to know
  that. Okay?”</p>\n\n<p>Corinne stepped into the limo. The traditional departure
  ritual began. She wept, as plaintive piano notes surrounded her. “Saying goodbye
  to Nick,” she told the camera, “is like, I feel like my heart is like, literally
  like—it’s never going to be repaired. I just want to feel loved—the way it’s supposed
  to be, like the <em>normal way</em>.”</p>\n\n<p>It was all standard-issue <em>Bachelor</em>
  stuff, right down to the invocation of “the normal way” … until things—as they so
  often will when Corinne is involved—took a turn. “I’m trying to, you know, say things
  that men think are appropriate,” she said, as her tears gave way to a slow smile.
  “And you know what? I’m <em>done</em>. Done trying to show my men how much I worship
  them and I love them and I care for them and I support them. <em>I</em> need that!
  So if someone feels that way about me? They can come and tell me. And they can bring
  a ring to go along with it.”</p>\n\n<p>It was … feminist? Sort of? It was also inflected
  with Corinne’s characteristic self-absorption and materialism, yes—and the probable
  result of some liberal editing, with that quick shift from weeping to grinning—but
  still. Corinne, with this, was rejecting the stuff of all those <em>Cosmo</em> stories
  offering advice on <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/advice/g3011/how-to-please-your-man/\">How
  to Please Your Man</a>—and the stuff, for that matter, of a culture that tends to
  assume that women, and women alone, should do the work of making sure that men feel
  supported, and cherished, and, indeed, “worshipped.” Corinne had spend her season
  of <em>The Bachelor</em> myopically—even maniacally—focused on Nick. She had been,
  in <em>Bachelor</em>ese, There for Nick and There for the Right Reasons and Not
  There to Make Friends. And in the end, if the aim is to be the woman before whom
  Nick “gets down on one knee,” it had all failed.</p>\n\n<p>Corinne took all that
  and then did something that is rare and almost rebellious within <em>The Bachelor</em>’s
  gauzy confines: She learned a lesson. She took the show’s truisms about coupledom
  and transformed them into other clichés: Corinne will, she suggested, from here
  on out, Focus on Herself and Do It for Herself. Corinne will do Corinne. She will
  <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2017/01/bachelor-recap-season-1-episode-3.html\">Make
  Corinne Great Again</a>. “I’m going to be me,” Corinne told the show’s invisible
  camera, as its invisible piano played her off. “And whatever happens, happens. But
  I will never kiss up to a man again in my entire life.”</p>\n"

summary: Over the course of the season, the show’s latest villain just might have
  … grown as a person.
