  <p>U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces announced Tuesday that they had <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-41646802">captured the city of Raqqa</a> from Islamic State militants.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Everything is finished in Raqqa, our forces have taken full control of Raqqa,&#8221; SDF spokesman Talal Sello told <a href="https://www.afp.com/en/news/23/islamic-state-group-loses-emblematic-syria-stronghold-raqa">AFP</a>. A formal declaration would be announced after operations to clear any remaining sleeper cells and to remove landmines in the city were completed, Sello added.</p>
  <p>The move is a major setback for the Islamic State which considered Raqqa the de-facto capital of its self-declared caliphate. It comes on the third <a href="http://www.inherentresolve.mil/News/News-Releases/Article/1345075/operation-inherent-resolve-observes-task-forces-third-anniversary/platform/hootsuite/">anniversary</a> of the global effort to defeat ISIS.</p>
  <p>Raqqa was the first provincial capital to fall from government control in <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/timeline-rise-and-spread-the-islamic-state">March 2013</a> after it was captured by a rebel army. The army included both Syrian opposition groups and more hard line  parties including al-Nusra and the Islamic State.</p>
  <p>A civilian government  that was established in the city divided two months later, and less than a year later ISIS recaptured Raqqa and named the the capital of their <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/caliphate/">caliphate</a>.</p>
  <p>About 900 civilians have been killed since the the start of the five-month operation, including 570 people in coalition air raids, according to the <a href="http://sn4hr.org/">Syrian Network for Human Rights</a>. The Britain-based <a href="http://www.syriahr.com/en/">Syrian Observatory for Human Rights</a> put the civilian death toll at 1,130 people. American journalist <a href="http://thegroundtruthproject.org/jim-foleys-legacy-journalism-public-service/">James Foley</a> was beheaded in the mountains south of the city.</p>
  <p>SDF fighters pulled down the Islamic State’s black flag from the city’s National Hospital near the city’s stadium, according to a Reuters <a href="https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CM0VC-OCATP">report</a>.</p>
  <p>Special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS Brett McGurk <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/how-trumps-decision-to-delegate-is-a-key-difference-in-syria/">said</a> in August that the U.S. would attempt to perform a “stabilization” in Raqqa &#8212; including demining, removing rubble from major pathways to allow trucks and equipment through, and “basic electricity, sewage, water, the basic essentials to allow populations to come back to their home.”</p>
  <p>It is not clear when the <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/syria-flash-update-recent-events-11-october-2017">300,000 civilians</a> who have fled Raqqa since April during the operation will be able to return.</p>
