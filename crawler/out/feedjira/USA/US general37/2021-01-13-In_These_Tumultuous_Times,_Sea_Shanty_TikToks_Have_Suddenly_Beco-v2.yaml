  has already served up plenty of wretched bombshells, the best surprise of the past
  two weeks might be TikTok&#8217;s biggest new trend: sea shanties. As the world
  hurtles head-first into 2021, sea shanties are turning into a safe harbor for social
  media users looking to take their mind off the events of the day with some (very)
  old-timey entertainment.</p><p>It all started when Scottish musician Nathan Evans
  recorded a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@nathanevanss/video/6910995345421962498?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fboingboing.net%2F&amp;referer_video_id=6910995345421962498&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6893506072067212806&amp;is_from_webapp=v1\"
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> performing a remarkably
  catchy rendition of &#8220;Wellerman,&#8221; a 19th century shanty of New Zealand
  origin. It blew up online, garnering over four million views on TikTok alone. From
  there, it wasn&#8217;t long before other users were piggybacking on the trend by
  duetting the whaling tune alongside Evans or debuting sea shanty performances of
  their own. Thus, #ShantyTok was born.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\t\t\t<figure

  ></div>\n\t\t\t</div></figure>\n\t\t\t<p>Despite the fact that the recent resurgence
  of sea shanties is owed entirely to the internet, their modern appeal certainly
  harkens back to their original purpose: synchronizing individual efforts to achieve
  a common goal.</p><p>In centuries past, the purpose of these call-and-response work
  songs was, of course, to maintain a ship crew&#8217;s focus on safely navigating
  often dangerous waters. Whether the task was rowing, hoisting sails or hauling nets,
  the hand-over-hand beat of sea shanties was intended to help sailors keep time with
  each other.</p><p>But amid a global pandemic that has kept many people at home and
  isolated for nearly a year, sea shanties can help foster a sense of community during
  a time when many are feeling lonely. As expertly noted by <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2021/01/tiktok-sea-shanties-explained.html\"
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Vulture</em>&#8216;s
  Kathryn VanArendonk</a>, at their heart, sea shanties are &#8220;unifying, survivalist
  songs, designed to transform a huge group of people into one collective body, all
  working together to keep the ship afloat.&#8221;</p><p>They&#8217;re also undeniable
  earworms.</p>\n\t\t\t<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter

  to TikTok&#8217;s duet feature, which allows users to build on fellow TikTokers&#8217;
  videos with their own additions, Evans&#8217; solo rendition of &#8220;Wellerman&#8221;
  has been transformed into a complex split-screen harmony, complete with multiple
  vocal parts and instrumental accompaniment. It&#8217;s a group project that everyone
  in the video worked on individually, which makes its success all the more impressive.</p>\n\t\t\t<figure

  how shanty sing-alongs have a way of drawing others in to the fold, or, as one commenter

  as a way to provide pleasure, connection and entertainment during periods of sustained
  social isolation.&#8221;</p>\n\t\t\t<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich
