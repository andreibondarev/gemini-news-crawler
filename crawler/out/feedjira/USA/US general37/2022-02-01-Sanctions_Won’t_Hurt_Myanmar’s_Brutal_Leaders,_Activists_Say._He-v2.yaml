  alt=\"Protests Continue Despite Military Vehicles Presence\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The U.S.
  imposed new sanctions on senior leaders of Myanmar&#8217;s military junta on Monday&mdash;the
  eve of the one-year anniversary of their <a href=\"https://time.com/5934896/myanmar-aung-san-suu-kyi-detained-coup/\"
  >overthrow of the country&#8217;s democratically elected government</a> and imprisonment
  of its leader, <a href=\"https://time.com/5793717/aung-san-suu-kyi-100-women-of-the-year/\"
  >Aung San Suu Kyi</a>.</p><p>The U.S., joined by the U.K., and Canada, announced
  sanctions on officials who helped prosecute Aung San Suu Kyi, the head of the National
  League for Democracy. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate was arrested in the <a href=\"https://time.com/5934896/myanmar-aung-san-suu-kyi-detained-coup/\"

  she faces additional charges.</p><p>Washington also slapped penalties on the scion

  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kyaw Thaung family</a>, who
  the New York<i> Times</i> reported has strong ties to the Myanmar military and helped
  it procure equipment. The sanctions also targeted a Myanmar government agency responsible
  for procuring arms for the military, which is known locally as the Tatmadaw. </p><p>But
  activists and Myanmar watchers say that the targeted sanctions will do little to
  deter a brutal regime that is increasingly isolated from the West and determined
  to put down resistance to its rule with violent repression. More than 1,500 people
  <a href=\"https://time.com/5944853/myanmar-military-crackdown-deaths/\" >have been
  killed in encounters with the junta</a> across the country, according to human rights
  group Assistance Association of Political Prisoners.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s
  fair to say that the West has had little leverage in Myanmar both politically and
  on the ground since the coup,&rdquo; says John Nielsen, Senior Analyst at Danish
  Institute for International Studies and former Danish Ambassador to Myanmar. </p><p>Pro-democracy
  protesters have long called on the international community to find ways to cut off
  the junta&rsquo;s revenue streams. And since last year&rsquo;s coup, several Western
  firms&mdash;including energy giants <a href=\"https://totalenergies.com/media/news/press-releases/totalenergies-withdraws-myanmar\"
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TotalEnergies</a> of France
  and <a href=\"https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevrons-view-on-myanmar\"  target=\"_blank\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chevron</a> of the U.S.&mdash;have vowed to pull
  business out of Myanmar due to human rights abuses in the country.</p><p><b>Read

  Hlaing and other members of the Tatmadaw were already under sanction by the U.S.
  and other nations. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/01/25/un-security-council-should-act-myanmar-atrocities\"
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Human Rights Watch</a> has
  urged the United Nations Security Council to impose a legally-binding global arms
  embargo on Myanmar. </p><p>But in addition to punitive measures, Burmese exiles
  say the international community must work to protect people suffering under the
  junta&#8217;s rule. London-based Burmese activist and scholar Maung Zarni says neighboring
  states should open their borders to Burmese refugees who flee from the Tatmadaw.</p><p>They
  are also wary of dialogue with the military leaders, which neighboring countries
  including some members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), favor.
  Nay San Lwin, a co-founder of the Free Rohingya Coalition, a global network of <a

  ><i>&lsquo;Risking Everything.&rsquo; Myanmar Activist Talks About Her Fight</i></a></p><p>But
  not everyone is shunning the Tatmadaw. Russia has been criticized for warming up
  to Myanmar post-coup, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/russia-myanmar-cooperating-military-equipment-supplies-ifax-2021-07-21/\"

  and its officials attending <a href=\"https://tass.com/defense/1190657\"  target=\"_blank\"
  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">junta-led events</a>. China also has ongoing
  dealings with Myanmar, but has taken a more ambivalent stance: It urged <a href=\"http://english.www.gov.cn/statecouncil/wangyi/202108/18/content_WS611d062fc6d0df57f98dea3b.html\"
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">&rdquo;to restart the democratic
  process</a>&rdquo; in the Southeast Asian country while engaging with both the Tatmadaw
  and ethnic armed forces. &ldquo;China&rsquo;s primary objectives in Myanmar is to
  ensure stability at the borders and get access to the Indian Ocean through an economic
  corridor from Kunming to Rakhine. They will work with any party in the conflict
  to accomplish these objectives&mdash;and that is in essence what they are doing,&rdquo;
  Nielsen says.</p><p>Jason Tower, Director for Myanmar at the United States Institute
  of Peace, says there must be a regional approach to the crisis, as companies closely
  aligned with the junta operate in neighboring states. If the U.S. and allies can
  convince Myanmar&#8217;s neighbors, including Thailand and India, to crack down
  on these firms, it could have a dramatic effect on the cash flowing to military
  leaders.</p><p>But the window for such action may be closing. Cambodia has taken
  over chairmanship of ASEAN in 2022. And Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen&mdash;no
  friend of democracy&mdash;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/cambodia-pm-says-myanmar-junta-welcome-asean-if-progress-made-2022-01-25/\"
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has given a conditional invitation
  the Myanmar coup leader</a>. Last year, the nine countries <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/10/26/asean-summit-begins-without-myanmar-after-top-generals-exclusion\"
  \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">barred the Myanmar junta&rsquo;s
  representative</a> from attending its meetings.</p><p>Increasingly many activists
  say they cannot rely on the international community to support their cause of restoring
  a democratic government in Myanmar. They are putting their faith in ethnic minority
  militias that have long fought the Tatmadaw, and the <a href=\"https://time.com/5951727/myanmar-military-protests-civil-war/\"
  >People&rsquo;s Defense Force</a>&mdash;an armed group composed of members of Myanmar&rsquo;s
  exiled shadow government and pro-democracy protesters. &#8220;If we want to be free,
  we have to fight for ourselves,&#8221; says Zarni.</p>"
