title: Conservatives shell long-standing White House Easter egg contest
url: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/conservatives-shell-decades-long-white-house-easter-egg-contest-rcna145771
summary: Several conservative outlets did not "yolk" around this weekend when covering
  the White House's annual Easter celebrations, accusing it of banning religious themes
  from the annual children's egg decorating contest â€” even though that guidance predated
  the Biden administration, according to the first lady's office.
