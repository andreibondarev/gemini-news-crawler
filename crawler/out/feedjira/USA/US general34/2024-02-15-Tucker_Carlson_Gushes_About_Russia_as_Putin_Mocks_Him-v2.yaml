content: <p>Despite Tucker Carlson publicly gushing about Russia at any opportunity,
  the leader of the country he&#x2019;s falling in love with decided to publicly lambast
  him.&#xA0;</p> <p>The former Fox News host recently made headlines after traveling
  to Russia and sitting down with President Vladimir Putin. It was the leader&#x2019;s
  first Western interview since Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine nearly two years
  ago, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands.&#xA0;</p> <p>The video has gotten
  over one million likes since being posted on X (the site formerly known as Twitter)
  on February 8. In the over two-hour video, Carlson lets Putin take complete control
  and ramble on about whatever subject matter he likes. At one point Putin talked
  for over half an hour. The interview has been described as &#x201C;embarrassing&#x201D;
  and &#x201C;sycophantic&quot;.&#xA0;</p> <p>Those who champion Carlson declared
  the interview as a brave journalist willing to expose a dangerous truth, but outside
  of his (vocal) fanbase, Carlson&#x2019;s interview was met with a <a href="https://nationalpost.com/opinion/adam-zivo-tucker-carlsons-idiots-guide-to-russian-aggression"
  target="_blank">more muted response</a>. Even the subject of the softball interview
  questioned Carlson&#x2019;s interviewing skills.&#xA0;</p> <p>&quot;To be honest,
  I thought that he would behave aggressively and ask so-called sharp questions. I
  was not just prepared for this, I wanted it, because it would give me the opportunity
  to respond in the same way,&quot; Putin said in a Russian TV interview. &quot;Frankly,
  I did not get full satisfaction from this interview.&#x201D;</p> <p>The most cringe
  moment of the interview occurred when <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/178898/tucker-carlson-putin-interview-mock-cia-dreams"
  target="_blank">Putin mocked Carlson</a> for once wanting to be a CIA operative.&#xA0;</p>
  <p>Carlson was fired from Fox News in 2023, as his firebrand backing of Trump, role
  in a massive lawsuit, and allegations of a toxic workplace all became <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/michael-wolff-fox-news-rupert-murdoch-tucker-carlson-book-excerpt.html"
  target="_blank">too much for Rupert Murdoch.</a> However, despite losing the backing
  of the right-wing media giant, Carlson remains relatively popular and influential.
  Unsurprisingly, since going independent, the content he features in his interview
  show has drifted even deeper into the realm of conspiracy. He&#x2019;s featured
  infamous conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, as well as a man who claimed he had drug-fueled
  sex with former President Barack Obama.&#xA0;</p> <p>Being roasted publicly by the
  subject of a loving interview hasn&#x2019;t seemed to dampen Carlson&#x2019;s love
  for Russia however. In a series of videos posted to his website, Carlson shows his
  viewers why Russia is superior to his home country. He made a loving video about
  the subway system in Moscow, set to swelling classical music, where he talks about
  how there are no &#x201C;bums, or drug addicts, or rapists, or people waiting to
  push you on the tracks to kill you.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p> <p>In another video, Carlson&#x2014;who
  made millions hosting a television show for Fox News&#x2014;stated that he had been
  &#x201C;radicalized&#x201D; against the leaders of the United States because of
  the grocery prices in Russia. He revels over the Moscow store offering such things
  as having to put in a coin to take a cart away and a &#x201C;grocery cart escalator.&#x201D;</p>
  <p>&#x201C;Seeing how much things cost and how people live will radicalize you against
  our leaders, that&#x2019;s how I feel radicalized,&#x201D; Carlson said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re
  not making this up by the way, at all.&#x201D;</p>
