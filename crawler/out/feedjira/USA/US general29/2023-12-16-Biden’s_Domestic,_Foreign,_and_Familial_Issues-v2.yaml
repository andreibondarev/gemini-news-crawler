  <br /></p><p dir="ltr">President Joe Biden faced a convergence of issues this week—domestic,
  foreign, and familial.</p><p dir="ltr">The Biden administration’s request for additional
  aid for Ukraine has stalled as House and Senate Republicans are prioritizing negotiations
  over border-security policies. Tensions between President Biden and Israeli Prime
  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the war in Gaza have spilled into the open. And
  Hunter Biden, the president’s only surviving son, defied a congressional subpoena
  and instead offered again to testify in public in front of the Republican-led House
  committees investigating him. All of this comes as the House voted along party lines
  to officially open its impeachment inquiry into the president.</p><p dir="ltr">Joining
  the guest moderator and a staff writer at <em>The Atlantic</em>, Franklin Foer, 
  to discuss this and more are Steve Inskeep, a co-host of NPR’s <em>Morning Edition</em>;
  Jonathan Karl, the chief Washington correspondent at ABC News and the author of
  <em>Tired of Winning: Donald Trump and the End of the Grand Old Party</em>; and
  Asma Khalid, a White House correspondent at NPR and a political contributor at ABC
  News.</p><div class="oembed" data-oembed-name="www.youtube.com" data-oembed-src="https://youtu.be/HqcdFwrinSQ?si=QUzEBj-0Uip84Nup"><iframe
