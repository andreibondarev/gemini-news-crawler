  <br /></p><p dir="ltr">The 2024 race is coming into focus this week after Republican
  front runner Donald Trump’s victory in New Hampshire brought him one step closer
  to the GOP’s presidential nomination. But his final primary opponent, former South
  Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, has rejected calls to drop out of the race and continued
  to campaign in her home state. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris
  have also ramped up their campaign, making reproductive rights a central theme of
  their reelection efforts.  </p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the fate of a bipartisan
  border-security deal, which Republican lawmakers had insisted upon before considering
  additional funding for Ukraine and Israel, has been complicated by Trump’s opposition
  to the deal.</p><p dir="ltr">Joining the editor in chief of <em>The Atlantic</em>
  and moderator, Jeffrey Goldberg, to discuss this and more are Laura Barrón-López,
  a White House correspondent at <em>PBS NewsHour</em>; Tom Nichols, a staff writer
  at <em>The Atlantic</em>; Ashley Parker, a senior national political correspondent
  for <em>The Washington Post</em>; and Chuck Todd, a chief political analyst at NBC
  News.</p><p dir="ltr">Read the full transcript <a href="https://www.pbs.org/weta/washingtonweek/video/2024/01/washington-week-with-the-atlantic-full-episode-12624">here</a>,
