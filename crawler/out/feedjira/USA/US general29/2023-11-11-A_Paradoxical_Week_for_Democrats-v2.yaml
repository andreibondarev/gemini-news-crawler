  <br /></p><p dir="ltr">Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia’s announcement
  that he will not seek reelection in 2024 capped a paradoxical week for Democrats.
  Manchin’s news puts Democrats’ control of the Senate at greater risk at the same
  time that polling for President Joe Biden continues to decline. But there was good
  news for Democrats: They scored a number of victories in Tuesday’s off-year election,
  including swing state Ohio voting to codify the right to an abortion in the state’s
  constitution.</p><p dir="ltr">Joining the editor in chief of <em>The Atlantic</em>
  and moderator, Jeffrey Goldberg, this week to discuss this and more are David Brooks,
  a columnist at <em>The New York Times</em> and the author of <em>How to Know a Person:
  The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen</em>; Eugene Daniels, a White
  House correspondent and a co-author of <em>Politico</em>’s Playbook; Asma Khalid,
  a White House correspondent at NPR; and Ed O’Keefe, a senior White House and political
  correspondent at CBS.</p><p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr">Read
