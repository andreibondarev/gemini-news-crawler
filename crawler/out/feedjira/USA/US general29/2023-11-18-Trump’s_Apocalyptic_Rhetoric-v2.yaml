  <br /></p><p dir="ltr">Former President Donald Trump has never been moderate in
  rhetoric and action. But there’s a real sense out there that, as he comes under
  further legal pressure, he’s become more apocalyptic: During a Veterans Day speech,
  echoing the language of authoritarian dictators, he described his political foes
  as “vermin.”  </p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, a rash of angry altercations
  erupted this week. Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California,
  allegedly elbowed fellow GOP Representative Tim Burchett of Tennessee in the kidneys,
  and Senator Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Oklahoma, challenged a hearing witness
  to a fight.</p><p>Joining the editor in chief of <em>The Atlantic</em> and moderator,
  Jeffrey Goldberg, to discuss this and more are Peter Baker, the chief White House
  correspondent at <em>The New York Times</em>; Leigh Ann Caldwell, a co-author of
  <em>The Washington Post</em>’s Early 202 newsletter and an anchor on <em>Washington
  Post Live</em>; Idrees Kahloon, the Washington bureau chief at <em>The Economist</em>;
  and Elaina Plott Calabro, a staff writer at <em>The Atlantic</em>.</p><p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">Read
