  <br /></p><p dir="ltr">On Wednesday, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
  passed away at the age of 100. As the country remembers the former statesman’s complicated
  legacy, his fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill are working to overcome their internal
  dysfunction: In the House, Republican Representative George Santos of New York was
  expelled from Congress in a rare bipartisan vote for ethics violations. And in the
  Senate, Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama attempted to reassure colleagues
  that his monthslong blockade of Pentagon nominations will end soon.</p><p dir="ltr">All
  of this comes as former President Donald Trump continues to lead in polls of Republican
  and evangelical voters six weeks before the Iowa caucuses.</p><p dir="ltr">Joining
  the editor in chief of <em>The Atlantic</em> and moderator, Jeffrey Goldberg, this
  week to discuss this and more are Tim Alberta, a staff writer at <em>The Atlantic</em>
  and the author of <em>The Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory: American Evangelicals
  in an Age of Extremism</em>; Elisabeth Bumiller, the assistant managing editor and
  Washington bureau chief at <em>The New York Times</em>; Eugene Daniels, a White
  House correspondent at <em>Politico</em> and a co-author of Playbook; and Philip
  Rucker, the national editor at <em>The Washington Post</em>.</p><div class="oembed"
