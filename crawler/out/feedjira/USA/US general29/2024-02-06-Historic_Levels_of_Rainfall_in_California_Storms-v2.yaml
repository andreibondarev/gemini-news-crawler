  \   \n\n<p>More than seven inches of rain fell on Los Angeles over Sunday and Monday,
  making it the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/02/california-storm-climate-change/677358/\">wettest
  two-day period</a> in decades—about half of the region’s average yearly rainfall
  poured down in 48 hours. The second storm in a long-duration atmospheric river brought
  high winds, flooding, and mudslides that have destroyed houses and cut power to
  more than 1 million people across Southern California.</p>\n"
