  <br /></p><p dir="ltr">President Joe Biden is facing a unique set of challenges
  as he prepares to run for reelection. The most unique of all: No one his age has
  ever run for president. And voters are worried, even those who give him credit for
  an improving economy. It’s also worth pointing out that Donald Trump is 77, and
  has been afflicted by more than the usual number of gaffes lately.</p><p dir="ltr">On
  Capitol Hill, the GOP’s new House Speaker, Mike Johnson, is a full week into the
  job and working to regain order. But the ideological divide among House Republicans

  Tommy Tuberville stalling military promotions erupted on the Senate floor.</p><p>Joining
  the editor in chief of <em>The Atlantic</em> and moderator, Jeffrey Goldberg, this
  week to discuss this and more are Dan Balz, a chief correspondent at <em>The Washington
  Post</em>; Adam Harris, a staff writer at <em>The Atlantic</em>; Susan Page, the
  Washington bureau chief at <em>USA Today</em>; and Alex Thompson, a national political
  correspondent at <em>Axios</em>.</p><p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">Read
