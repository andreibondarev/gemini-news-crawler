  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conspiracy theories</a> that took over social media
  amid Kate Middleton’s mystery health situation — before she revealed her cancer
  diagnosis last week — were amplified by Russian disinformation campaigns, according
  to security researchers at Cardiff University in Wales. </p><p>While there was legitimate
  concern for the Princess of Wales’ health and her whereabouts while she was recovering
  from a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-middleton-hospitalized-surgery-expected-stay-2-weeks"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">"planned abdominal surgery"</a> in January, and privately
  beginning chemotherapy treatments, Kremlin contractors were also taking advantage
  of the frenzy around the royal to promote pro-Russian and anti-Ukrainian narratives. </p><p>"We
  have a long-term program of research looking at disinformation and information manipulation
  online and what we did in this particular case was we were monitoring the traffic
  around the story about the Princess of Wales and we noticed some unusual spikes
  in the traffic," Professor Martin Innes, Cardiff University''s Security, Crime and
  Intelligence Institute director, told ABC Australia radio host Patricia Karvelas.
   </p><p>Innes said when their researchers looked into the spikes more closely, "we
  saw some unusual patterns of activity and behavior on a number of accounts that
  we recognized from having looked at a particular Russian disinformation group before." </p><p><a

  ‘THRILLED’ AS SHE ACCEPTS TOUCHING SIGN FROM TWO TOUNG FANS</strong></a></p><p>He
  added, "The group in question has been around for several years now, and it’s quite
  well-known in the open-source research community. What they were doing in this particular
  example was they were taking advantage of the massive amount of interest that there
  was in the story." </p><p>He said rather than posting original content themselves
  about the princess’ health, "they would find popular posts, and then they would
  reply to those posts, inserting their own content into the comments and replies."</p><p>He
  continued, "Typically, the content would either be <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">denigrating Ukraine</a> and celebrating Russia’s
  achievements in the war or talking up the integrity of the recent Russian election." </p><p><a

  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>KATE MIDDLETON''S CANCER ANNOUNCEMENT VIDEO

  Middleton’s health turned into a frenzy soon after Kensington Palace announced on
  Jan. 17, that the princess had undergone a "planned abdominal surgery" and would
  postpone her public engagements until Easter. </p><p>To quell the rumor mill, on
  March 10, the princess posted a photo of herself with her children, wishing Brits
  a happy Mother’s Day. News agencies like the Associated Press deemed the photo to
  be "manipulated" and pulled it, saying it didn’t meet their journalistic standards. </p><p><a

  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PRINCE WILLIAM ‘SIMMERING’ OVER KATE MIDDLETON
  HEALTH SPECULATION, IS ‘BOUND TO CRACK’: EXPERT</strong></a></p><p>Despite Middleton’s
  admission that she sometimes likes to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-middleton-apologizes-confusion-around-edited-family-photo"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">"experiment with editing,"</a> the photo further
  inflamed already out-of-control conspiracy theories. </p><p>The rumors only began
  to die down after the princess delivered a video message on March 22 that she had
  been <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-middleton-announces-cancer-undergoing-chemotherapy-treatment"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">diagnosed with cancer</a>. </p><p>Innes told NBC
  News and The New York Times, that the researchers had identified 45 social media
  accounts that were linked to the Russian disinformation group Doppelgänger.</p><p>He
  also noted that the group didn’t start any of the conspiracy theories, but rather
  seized on them. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank"

  accounts were driving the story; they were jumping on it," he told NBC News. "It
  was already being framed in conspiracy terms, so foreign actors don’t need to set
  that frame — that’s already there to exploit."</p><p>Innes explained that replying
  to posts rather than creating original content is strategic because it makes it
  harder for social media platforms to regulate their comments. </p><p>"They obviously
  have an ideological agenda, but what’s interesting about this group is they’re not
  part of the state security services, which is some of the actors we’ve been seeing
  behind other disinformation campaigns," he told ABC Australia. "They are commercial
  organizations contracted by the Kremlin to deliver social media messaging for them
  a bit like sort of a dark PR firm." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters"

  agenda, the campaigners also want to get paid. He said they would try to meet their
  "performance indicators" by "jumping on popular stories and hijacking those." </p><p>He
  said, "Not only did they manage to kind of push the narratives they want, they’re
  also interested in fulfilling their contract, and it’s an ideal and quite easy way
  for them  to hit their performance targets." </p><p>Innes told NBC News that the
  group’s focus is on "destabilization" and "undermining trust in institutions" such
  as government, the monarchy and media. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/download"

  amount of attention on the story of the Princess of Wales has been enormous and
  so, just by inserting your messages and jumping on certain hashtags like that you
  can, particularly if you''re persistent and keep going with it, you can get a lot
  of eyeballs and a lot of attention to some of the messaging that you want to put
  across," he told ABC Australia. </p><p>The Wales-based researchers also identified
  dark PR firms working out of Pakistan, Indonesia, and other countries, using the
  frenzy around the princess to amplify ther own agendas. </p><p>"And this is quite
  a regular occurrence now, really every hot political, celebrity story tends to attract
  this kind of attention," he warned. "It’s almost like they function as magnets for
  people who want to grow their number of followers and get attention for the messages
  they want to put across."</p>'
