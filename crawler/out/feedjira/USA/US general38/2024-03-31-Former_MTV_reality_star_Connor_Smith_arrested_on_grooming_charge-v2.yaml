  previously told authorities that he would surrender himself to them, but he failed
  to do so.</p><p>Smith had previously been accused of inappropriate behavior towards
  a minor in 2021. He was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener"><u>arrested</u></a> and charged with rape, sexual battery and two
  counts of criminal confinement, according to court documents obtained by Us Weekly. </p><p>According
  to The Times of Northwest Indiana, the charges were dropped in Sept. 2022. </p><p><a
  href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/in-court" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener"><u>An attorney for Smith</u></a> said at the time that they were
  "pleased with the outcome and glad we were able to vindicate our client of these
  horrible false charges."</p><p>Additionally, attorney Maryam Afshar-Stewart told
  the media, "Unfortunately, these type of accusations, despite a dismissal, carry
  consequences that are far-reaching. . . . While a dismissal is a step in the right
  direction, Mr. Smith has a long road ahead to repair the damage that has been caused
  by these false allegations."</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Caroline Thayer contributed
