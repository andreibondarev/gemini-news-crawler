content: '<p>Rebel Wilson, like many in Hollywood, revealed she has tried the popular
  weight-loss <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sharon-osbourne-doesnt-regret-taking-ozempic"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">drug Ozempic</a><a rel="noopener">.</a></p><p>In
  a new interview with the Sunday Times, Wilson spoke about her weight-loss journey
  and the various methods she employed to lose approximately 80 pounds since 2020.</p><p>One
  of those was Ozempic, which she briefly used, saying, "Someone like me could have
  a bottomless appetite for sweets, so I think those drugs can be good."</p><p>Wilson
  is no longer taking Ozempic, and she ultimately focused not only on physical but
  mental health to lose weight.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rebel-wilson-treated-different-weight-loss-transformation"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>REBEL WILSON DISCUSSES ‘INTERESTING’ WAYS
  PEOPLE HAVE TREATED HER AFTER WEIGHT-LOSS TRANSFORMATION</strong></a></p><p>She
  noted that people were initially reluctant to encourage her to lose weight, based
  on her career success playing "the funny fat girl."</p><p>"Basically, no one apart
  from my mum wanted me to lose weight," she said. "People thought I’d lose my pigeonhole
  in my career, playing the fat funny character, and they wanted me to continue in
  that," she told the outlet.</p><p>"I wasn’t dealing with my emotions properly, I
  was just stuffing my face and holding on to them," she said of her mental health.
  After speaking with a doctor to address those concerns, she said "the weight just
  kind of dropped off."</p><p>Wilson also pursued weight loss to improve her chances
  at IVF, and she <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rebel-wilson-welcomes-baby-girl-via-surrogate"

  Sunday Times she is currently at a weight she’s comfortable with, calling it "still
  curvy and solid."</p><p>"I feel strongly that young women shouldn’t try to obsess
  over looking like Victoria’s Secret models; they should just look like themselves,"
  Wilson said. "I know that my relationship with food is complicated."</p><p>Her weight
  is part of her ongoing issues with comedian <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sacha-baron-cohen-denies-rebel-wilsons-claim-was-a-hole-movie-set"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sacha Baron Cohen</a><a rel="noopener">.</a></p><p>Last
  week, Wilson revealed that the "a-hole" she was referring to in her new memoir,
  "Rebel Rising," was Cohen after they worked together on "The Brothers Grimsby."</p><p><a

  will not be bullied or silenced by high priced lawyers or PR crisis managers," Wilson
  wrote in an Instagram story. "The ‘a--hole’ that I am talking about in ONE CHAPTER
  of my book is: Sacha Baron Cohen."</p><p>A representative for Cohen refuted her
  claims, telling Fox News Digital, "While we appreciate the importance of speaking
  out, these demonstrably false claims are directly contradicted by extensive detailed
  evidence, including contemporaneous documents, film footage, and eyewitness accounts
  from those present before, during and after the production of ''The Brothers Grimsby.’"</p><p>In
  her Sunday Times interview, Wilson said she felt "disrespected on set" and that
  her weight was used against her.</p><p>"It’s one thing for someone who is fat to
  exploit their size for comedy, but it’s another for somebody else to humiliate you,"
  Wilson said.</p><p>She felt that the costumes purposefully highlighted "all the
  cellulite on my thighs" and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rebel-wilson-responds-accused-fat-phobia-not-including-plus-sizes-new-clothing-line"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">other insecurities</a> and that she was "something
  to be laughed at and degraded because of my size."</p><p>According to the outlet,
  she wrote in her memoir, "I’m sharing my story now because the more women talk about
  things like this, hopefully the less it happens. And hopefully fewer women have
  to work harder just to respect themselves."</p><p>"Rebel Rising" will be released
  April 2.</p>'
