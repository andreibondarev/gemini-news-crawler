content: <p>Emotions ran high late in Saturday's game between the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/toronto-blue-jays"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toronto Blue Jays</a> and Tampa Bay Rays. Blue Jays
  pitcher Génesis Cabrera got into a heated verbal exchange with Rays infielder José
  Caballero at the end of the seventh inning.</p><p>The three-day-old <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Major League Baseball</a> season has now seen two
  scuffles over the past two days. Players spilled out of each dugout during Friday's
  game between the Mets and Brewers, after Milwaukee's Rhys Hoskins slid hard into
  second base during a double-play attempt.</p><p>Saturday's altercation turned physical
  when Cabrera shoved Caballero, prompting both team's benches to empty. Shortly before
  the confrontation, Caballero's bunt single drove in a run. But, he continued around
  the bases after third baseman Justin Turner made a throwing error. Toronto outfielder
  George Springer ran down the errant throw and threw to the shortstop, who then tagged
  Caballero out at third base.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank"

  backing up third base, and Caballero came together as the play concluded and exchanged
  words. The confrontation ensued, although no punches were thrown. Cabrera was eventually
  ejected.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mets-pitcher-ejected-throwing-behind-rhys-hoskins-earlier-benches-clearing-incident"

  RHYS HOSKINS AFTER EARLIER BENCHES-CLEARING INCIDENT</strong></a></p><p>"I saw the
  ball in the bullpen and started running. The coach is waving at me to go to third.
  When I got to third, I see Bichette had the ball already, so I gave myself up. I’m
  kind of slowing down and Cabrera comes out of nowhere and kind of tags me. But there’s
  no play, I’m already out," Caballero said. "I just asked him, why did you push me?
  He didn’t say a word. He just came up to me and pushed me again."</p><p>The dust-up
  came two innings after the Rays’ Randy Arozarena celebrated his solo homer by kissing
  his bat, doing a cross-arm pose and then signing autographs for fans after returning
  to the dugout.</p><p>"I will say it was more like the heat of the moment," Cabrera
  said through a translator. "I mean, I think we all kind of overreact a little bit.
  I mean, he kind of looked at me and I just react. ... It’s part of the game sometimes,
  but it’s over with. It’s where it ends, right there."</p><p>Rays manager Kevin Cash
  thought Caballero handled the situation well by not doing anything to escalate the
  confrontation. "Both teams didn’t let it get out of hand," Cash said.</p><p>Blue
  Jays manager John Schneider agreed. "It was handled really well by everyone, umpires
  and Tampa, and us," Schneider said. "It was kind of just one of those things where
  it just kind of happened and they issued warnings and everyone was fine with that."</p><p><i>The
