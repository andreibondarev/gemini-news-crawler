content: '<p>Israeli Prime Minister <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/benjamin-netanyahu"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, ahead of surgery for a hernia
  on Sunday, vowed that Israel would invade Rafah, despite twin pressures from Ramadan
  and Washington.  </p><p>Netanyahu, 74, said he had approved the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/israels-netanyahu-rebuffs-us-plea-halt-rafah-offensive-tensions-rise-ahead-washington-talks"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDF’s "operational plan" for Rafah</a>, saying the
  force was "prepared for the evacuation of the civilian population and for the provision
  of humanitarian assistance." </p><p>"This is the right thing both operationally
  and internationally," he said. "This will take time but it will be done. We will
  enter Rafah and we will eliminate the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hamas battalions</a> there for one simple reason:
  There is no victory without entering Rafah and there is no victory without eliminating
  the Hamas battalions there." </p><p>The comments came after the Israeli leader met
  with the families of the hostages still in Gaza. He rejected accusations that he
  was delaying their release. </p><p>"Those who say I am not doing everything to return
  the hostages are wrong and misleading, and those who know the truth and still repeating
  this lie are causing unnecessary grief to the families of the hostages," he said.</p><p><a

  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SILENT OVER HAMAS''
  USE OF GAZA HOSPITAL AS TERROR HQ</strong></a></p><p>Netanyahu alleged that Israel
  has "relaxed" its position in negotiations while Hamas has "hardened" theirs. </p><p>"Despite
  all the difficulty involved, negotiations must be conducted calmly and with level-headed
  determination," he said. "This is the only way to return hostages." </p><p>Netanyahu
  has kept a full schedule throughout Israel''s nearly six-month-long war against
  Hamas. A hernia was discovered during a routine checkup, but his doctors have said
  he is otherwise in good health. Doctors acknowledged last year that he had concealed
  a long-known heart problem after they implanted a pacemaker.</p><p>Israeli society
  was broadly united immediately after Oct. 7, when Hamas killed some 1,200 people
  during a cross-border attack and took 250 others hostage. Nearly six months of conflict
  have renewed divisions over the leadership of Netanyahu, though the country remains
  largely in favor of the war.</p><p>Thousands of Israelis gathered outside the parliament
  building in Jerusalem on Sunday, marking the largest anti-government demonstration
  since the war began. They urged the government to reach a cease-fire deal to free
  dozens of hostages held by the Hamas militant group in Gaza and to hold early elections.</p><p><a

  half the hostages in Gaza were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November.
  But attempts by international mediators to bring home the remaining hostages have
  failed. Talks resumed on Sunday with little expectation of a breakthrough.</p><p>Netanyahu
  has said there can be no victory without a military ground offensive in Rafah, the
  southern Gaza city where more than half of the territory''s population of 2.3 million
  now shelters after fleeing fighting elsewhere. </p><p>Gaza''s Hamas-run Health Ministry
  said Sunday that more than  32,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start
  of the war. The ministry''s count does not differentiate between civilians and fighters,
  but it has said that women and children make up around two-thirds of those killed.</p><p>Israel
  has disputed these figures, saying that more than one-third of the dead are militants,
  and it blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the group operates in residential
  areas.</p><p><i>Fox News'' Yael Rotem-Kuriel and The Associated Press contributed
