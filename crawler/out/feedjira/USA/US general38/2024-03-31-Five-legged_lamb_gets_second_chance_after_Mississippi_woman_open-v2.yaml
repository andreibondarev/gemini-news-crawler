  after a Mississippi woman took him in just in time for the Easter holiday.</p><p>"He
  is definitely one loved lamb by everyone who sees him," Natalie Renot told Fox News
  Digital.</p><p>Renot, who is passionate about rehabilitating animals that need a
  helping hand, said that Spider-Lamb was in rough shape when <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">she rescued him</a> earlier this week. </p><p>"My
  vet didn’t think he was going to pull through," Renot said. "He was infested with
  maggots, and he had a bad infection and an extremely high fever, but he pulled through!!"</p><p><a

  that helping animals is one of the "most rewarding" things.</p><p>"It’s stressful,
  it’s depressing, it’s losing a lot of sleep, but it’s also the most rewarding thing
  to give up your time to get an animal the opportunity to live," Renot said.</p><p><a
