  the world during their retirement — and they’re off and doing just that. </p><p>Bev
  and John Martin retired in 2020. They decided to start "small" on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">their travel adventures</a> by road tripping around
  the United States first.</p><p>The pair purchased an Airstream trailer and made
  it their mission to mark every state off their bucket list — something they proudly
  accomplished.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/pennsylvania-couple-traveling-all-over-globe-share-amazing-photos-stories-world-travels"

  who now run a blog called Retirement Travelers, decided to take things to the next
  level after that. </p><p>They sold <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/house-and-home"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">their home,</a> donated items to charity and gave
  things to their children and more, all to travel the world. </p><p>"We thought,
  ‘Why not go see the world?’" John Martin told SWNS.</p><p>The couple, who are grandparents,
  said they got rid of everything, including the Airstream that took them around the
  U.S. — but kept their golf clubs, as noted on Retirement Travelers.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/solo-travel-experts-benefits-traveling-alone-hot-destinations-put-bucket-list"

  the Martins told SWNS that their children were extremely supportive of their big
  decision. </p><p>"I think our children are excited for us to live out our best lives,"
  Bev said. </p><p>She continued, "I hope we are setting a good example for them that
  things don’t matter, items don’t matter."</p><p>At the age of just 60 and 61, John
  and Bev Martin left behind Stuart, Florida, for a life of backpacking across the
  globe. </p><p>So far, the pair have gone to Morocco, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia,
  Australia, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Croatia, Montenegro,
  Serbia, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Sweden, Ireland, Chile, Uruguay — and dozens more
  locations.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/bucket-list-solo-travelers"

  href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saving
  money</a> and living within their means, the Martins have been traveling around
  the world since Nov. 2021. </p><p>The retired travelers said on their blog that
  they normally stay in an Airbnb or hotel for between four and seven days before
  moving on to another spot. </p><p>"As we age, we anticipate slowing down a bit,
  but at this time, we are healthy enough to move about, and because we carry so little
  in our backpacks, it is not difficult to move on down the road when we choose,"
  the couple wrote on their blog. </p><p>The pair, now 92 countries into their excursion,
  said they come home to see their family twice a year but have met <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/family-and-friends"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">new friends</a> through their travels. </p><p>"We
  are happy to report [that] we make new friends all the time, and we are blessed
  beyond measure to have dear friends who support our dream and encourage us to go
  while we can," they said.</p><p>They said <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ukraine was one</a> of the most memorable spots they’ve
  visited, as John Martin’s grandfather came to the United States from Ukraine in
  the early 1900s — but was never able to return, as SWNS reported. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl"

  dream of returning, [and] it felt so incredible to cross the border not knowing
  when we might get to return," he recalled. </p><p>John Martin told Fox News Digital
  on Friday, March 29, that he and his wife are currently in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/south-africa"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cape Town, South Africa</a>, and are headed on a
  safari beginning the week of April 1 — something they''ve always dreamed of doing. </p><p>He
  noted that one stop was the most surprising: Guatemala. </p><p>"The landscape is
  incredible at Lake Atitlán, and so many people cautioned us not to go because of
  safety, [but] we had a wonderful visit and the people were so gracious," he said. </p><p>When
  asked what the couple might miss most about the United States, John Martin said
  a simple, home-cooked meal — plus Cracker Barrel. </p><p>"Usually when we land back
  in the States, you can find us at the nearest Cracker Barrel ordering a veggie platter
  and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/coffee-vs-tea-which-drink-better-you"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">a large glass of tea,</a>" he said. </p><p>He joked
  that "being called ‘Sweetie’ by the waitress is the welcome we need."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle"
