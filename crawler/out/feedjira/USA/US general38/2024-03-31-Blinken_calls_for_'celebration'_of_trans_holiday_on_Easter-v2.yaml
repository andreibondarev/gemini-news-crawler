  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Antony Blinken</a> became the latest Biden administration
  official to mark Transgender Day of Visibility, which has sparked controversy for
  being celebrated the same day as Easter.</p><p>"Transgender Day of Visibility is
  a celebration of the courage and resilience of transgender, nonbinary and gender
  non-confirming persons who exist in every country and culture around the world,"
  Blinken said in a statement Sunday. </p><p>"On this day, the United States recognizes
  the achievements and progress that trans persons have made in the global struggle
  for equality and re-affirms its commitment to supporting the equality, inclusion
  and full recognition of the human rights of transgender persons."</p><p>The statement
  comes after <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">President Biden</a> sparked backlash with a similar statement Friday,
  marking Sunday as a day to "honor the extraordinary courage and contributions of
  transgender Americans."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-demands-biden-issue-apology-over-blasphemous-trans-visibility-day-easter-sunday-appalling"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP DEMANDS BIDEN ISSUE APOLOGY OVER ''BLASPHEMOUS''
  TRANS VISIBILITY DAY ON EASTER SUNDAY: ''APPALLING''</strong></a></p><p>Conservatives
  on social media questioned the timing of the White House celebration, noting the
  day falls on Easter Sunday, one of the holiest days of the Christian calendar.</p><p>"The
  Biden White House has betrayed the central tenet of Easter — which is the resurrection
  of Jesus Christ," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mike-johnson"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>House Speaker Mike Johnson</u></a> said on X.
  "Banning sacred truth and tradition—while at the same time proclaiming Easter Sunday
  as ''Transgender Day''—is outrageous and abhorrent. The American people are taking
  note."</p><p>"I am absolutely disgusted that Joe Biden has declared the most Holy
  of Holy days — a self proclaimed devout Catholic — as Transgender Day of Visibility,"
  former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete Caitlyn Jenner said. "The only thing
  you should be declaring on this day is ‘HE is Risen’."</p><p>The White House celebration
  also earned the scorn of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">former President Trump</a>, and Trump''s national
  press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, called on Biden to issue an apology for the statement.</p><p><a

  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>BIDEN SLAMMED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER ANNOUNCING
  TRANSGENDER DAY OF VISIBILITY ON EASTER SUNDAY</u></strong></a> </p><p>"We call
  on Joe Biden''s failing campaign and the White House to issue an apology to the
  millions of Catholics and Christians across America who believe (Sunday) is for
  one celebration only — the resurrection of Jesus Christ," Leavitt said.</p><p>In
  Blinken''s statement, the secretary of state noted that "trans persons face violence,
  suppression, and infringements on their human rights and fundamental freedoms" in
  other parts of the world, but he argued the United States is urging "partners around
  the globe to work with the United States in fighting for a world in which transgender
  persons are free to live safely and openly as themselves."</p><p>The White House
  argued the celebration always falls on March 31 and that Easter is not always the
  same day, and it issued a statement in response Saturday, calling the backlash over
  its celebration of the day divisive.</p><p>"<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/christianity"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">As a Christian</a> who celebrates Easter with family,
  President Biden stands for bringing people together and upholding the dignity and
  freedoms of every American," the statement said. </p><p>"Sadly, it’s unsurprising
  politicians are seeking to divide and weaken our country with cruel, hateful and
  dishonest rhetoric. President Biden will never abuse his faith for political purposes
  or for profit."</p><p>Reached for comment, a State Department spokesperson referred
  Fox News Digital the White House statement.</p>'
