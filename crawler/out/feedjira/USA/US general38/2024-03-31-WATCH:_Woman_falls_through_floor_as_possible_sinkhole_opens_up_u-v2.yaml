content: <p>Video captured the moment last weekend when a woman casually shopping
  in a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">Chinese department store</a> disappeared as a possible sinkhole swallowed
  a portion of the floor. </p><p>A construction worker on the first floor of a shopping
  mall in the city of Zhenjiang in Jiangsu, China, told local outlets a sinkhole opened
  up, trapping him and causing the floor above to collapse. </p><p>In the video, a
  woman was walking around on the second story of a shopping mall in Zhenjiang when
  <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/disasters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the
  floor caved in</a>, toppling two clothing racks as the woman fell through the hole.
  A second woman, wearing a yellow jacket, ran away from the hole before stopping
  to go back and check on the other woman, according to Newsflare.</p><p>Mr. Huang,
  a representative of the mall, told reporters both people suffered only minor injuries.
  Emergency crews and firefighters responded immediately and helped rescue both of
  the victims before cleaning up the damage.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/could-protective-barriers-prevented-baltimore-bridge-collapse"

  to sinkholes. A giant one opened once up in an ancient forest in Guangxi Zhuang.
  The hole measured 1,000 feet in length, 490 feet in width and nearly 630 feet in
  depth. Experts determined the sinkhole had three cave entrances. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/3-killed-several-missing-incident-migrant-boat-southeastern-spain"

  to the local news agency.</p><p>Sinkholes can form when the ground is worn away,
  either due to composition — such as limestone, a porous rock that easily dissolves
  in water — from a loss of groundwater that causes air pockets to form or from acid
  rainwater eating away at bedrock. </p>
