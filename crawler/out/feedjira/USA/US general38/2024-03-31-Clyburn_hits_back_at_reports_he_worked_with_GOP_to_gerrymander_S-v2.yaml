content: <p>Rep. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/rep-jim-clyburn-very-concerned-black-voter-turnout-out-biden"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jim Clyburn,</a> D-S.C., hit back at a 2023 report
  that alleged he worked with Republicans to maintain a "grip" on his South Carolina
  district by making sure "30,000 Black voters" would be redrawn into his district
  for the 2024 elections, which he said was "absolutely not true." </p><p>"ProPublica
  has a report that you actually worked with Republicans on this map to maintain a
  tighter grip on your own district by ensuring that 30,000 Black voters would move
  from a neighboring swing district into your own. Was that the case?" NBC News host
  Kristen Welker asked Clyburn. </p><p>"No that is not the case at all," Clyburn said.
  "When someone picks up the phone and asks you, ‘what are your suggestions as we
  are about to get these lines drawn,' I offered my suggestions," he said. "And I
  certainly didn't ask my district to be turned into a minority district, and that's
  what it is. People keep publishing that I have a majority minority district, that
  is absolutely not true, check the numbers." </p><p>A federal <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/south-carolina-congressional-map-stay-this-years-elections-panel-rules"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">court in South Carolina ruled</a> on Thursday that
  this year's congressional elections in South Carolina will be held under a map that
  it had already deemed unconstitutional and discriminatory against Black voters,
  with time running out ahead of voting deadlines and a lack of a decision on the
  case by the Supreme Court.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/alabama-republicans-reject-proposal-create-2nd-majority-black-district-despite-supreme-court-ruling"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ALABAMA REPUBLICANS REJECT PROPOSAL TO CREATE
  2ND MAJORITY-BLACK DISTRICT DESPITE SUPREME COURT RULING</strong></a></p><p>A panel
  of three federal judges from South Carolina wrote that "with the primary election
  procedures rapidly approaching, the appeal before the Supreme Court still pending,
  and no remedial plan in place, the ideal must bend to the practical."</p><p>The
  case hinges on South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District, currently held by Republican
  Rep. Nancy Mace. Last year, the same 3-judge panel ordered South Carolina to redraw
  the district, which runs from Charleston to Hilton Head Island, after finding that
  the state used race as a proxy for partisan affiliation in violation of the equal
  protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.</p><p>Clyburn said
  people were misrepresenting what happened and that it had been going on for years. </p><p>"Yes,
  I offered my suggestions. Did they follow my suggestions? Absolutely not, and so
  when you say you spoke to me, and that there's an agreement, that is absolutely
  not true," he continued, adding that the reporter was trying to make a "headline"
  rather than "headway" on the story. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-supreme-court-rejects-michigan-commissions-plea-overturn-order-redraw-detroit-legislative-seats"

  PLEA TO OVERTURN ORDER TO REDRAW DETROIT LEGISLATIVE SEATS</u></strong></a></p><p><a
  href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/left-wing-nonprofit-leads-charge-against-justice-clarence-thomas-political-drive-by-shooting"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProPublica alleged</a> in 2023 that Clyburn sent
  an aide, Dalton Tresvant, to meet with state Republicans about the new congressional
  map. The report claimed Clyburn's suggested map would benefit his standing within
  his own district and Republicans in a neighboring district.</p><p>"Some of Tresvant’s
  proposals appealed to Republicans. The sketch added Black voters to Clyburn’s district
  while moving out some predominantly White precincts that leaned toward the GOP.
  The Republicans kept Tresvant’s map confidential as they worked through the redistricting
  process for the following two months," ProPublica reported. </p><p>According to
  ProPublica, a spokesperson previously confirmed that they "engaged in discussions
  regarding the boundaries of the 6th Congressional District."</p><p>After South Carolina's
  Legislature, which Republicans lead, redrew the district, civil rights groups swiftly
  filed a lawsuit, charging state lawmakers with choosing "perhaps the worst option
  of the available maps" for Black voters, arguing they had removed Black voters and
  made it a safer seat for Republicans.</p><p>Last year, a 3-judge panel — the same
  that issued Thursday's order — concluded that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/south-carolina"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Carolina’s legislature</a> "exiled" 30,000
  Democratic-leaning Black voters from the 1st District to help safeguard Mace. The
  state appealed that ruling, and the Supreme Court heard arguments in October but
  has yet to issue a decision.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>
