  Police told Fox News Digital that officers were called to a multi-vehicle accident
  on the expressway. Police said a preliminary investigation determined two drivers
  — one in a Corvette and one in a Lamborghini — were speeding in the left lane.</p><p>The
  drivers lost control of their vehicles, and the Lamborghini traveled onto the shoulder
  and hit the center median wall, causing a chain-reaction collision involving four
  other vehicles, six in total, police said.</p><p>The occupants in the Lamborghini
  and Corvette fled without stopping to see whether anyone needed help or providing
  information, police said. Two drivers involved in the crash were treated, and two
  others were taken to a hospital for minor injuries.</p><p>Police were still investigating
  the crash.</p><p>It was unclear which vehicle Rice was in.</p><p>The 23-year-old
