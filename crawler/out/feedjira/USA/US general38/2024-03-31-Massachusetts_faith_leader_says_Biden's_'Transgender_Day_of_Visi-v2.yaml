content: '<p>As Christians, even on Easter, "we expect friction (if not worse) from
  the world (Matthew 10:16-25)," said <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/james-spencer"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">faith leader James Spencer</a> to Fox News Digital
  this week.</p><p>And the right response to that, said the president of the D. L.
  Moody Center in Northfield, Massachusetts, "is to continue to deepen our commitment
  to Christ through worship and discipleship."</p><p>Spencer, however, expressed concern
  over President Biden''s recent proclamation of March 31, 2024, on which Easter Sunday
  falls, as the "Transgender Day of Visibility (TDOV)" in America. Spencer noted that
  the announcement drew harsh reactions on social media.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/jesus-christs-resurrection-means-all-road-emmaus-texas-pastor"

  ALL ON THE ‘ROAD TO EMMAUS,’ SAYS TEXAS PASTOR</strong></a></p><p>"Some have suggested
  that this was yet another <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/christianity"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">attack on Christianity</a> by the Biden administration,"
  he said.</p><p>"While I don’t see how declaring the TDOV on the same day as Easter,
  regardless of historical precedent, could encourage unity, I’m less concerned with
  the date of TDOV than with what I believe to be a potential distraction for the
  Christian community during the Easter season."</p><p>Charging that politicians don''t
  often have the church''s interests at heart, he decried "pandering to Christians
  by quoting Bible passages out of context" and "pointing to the truth that we are
  all made in the image of God to underscore human dignity without acknowledging the
  responsibility that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/faith-values" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">being made in God’s image</a> implies."</p><p>White House spokesperson
  Andrew Bates released a statement this weekend saying those who are critical of
  Biden’s inclusiveness message are trying to further divide the country.</p><p>"As
  a Christian who celebrates Easter with family, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden</a> stands for bringing people together
  and upholding the dignity and freedoms of every American," Bates said in an earlier
  statement to Fox News Digital. "Sadly, it’s unsurprising politicians are seeking
  to divide and weaken our country with cruel, hateful and dishonest rhetoric. President
  Biden will never abuse his faith for political purposes or for profit."</p><p>The
  date March 31 is one of several dates that has been designated to honor the transgender
  movement internationally since at least 2009. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-doubles-down-inclusiveness-message-backlash-transgender-day-visibility-easter"

  this year it falls on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/christianity"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Easter Sunday</u></a> — one of the most important
  days in all of Christianity as the resurrection of Jesus Christ is celebrated. </p><p>Spencer
  suggested some appropriate responses by Christians in the wake of the president''s
  declaration and the actions and comments of other political officials. </p><p>"First,
  we need to recognize that our governing officials are human," Spencer said. "Because
  they are human, they are often going to be misguided. As such, one of our first
  responses should be compassion. If Jesus can say it about the Roman guards who crucified
  Him, how can we not step back at a comparatively minor injury and say, ‘Father,
  forgive them, for they know not what they do.’"</p><p>He said as well, "Jesus offers
  us an example of what it means to love our enemies and to pray for those who persecute
  us."</p><p>Spencer said the second potential response is to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/faith"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">"endure in faithfulness."</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/cardinal-dolan-new-york-reveals-good-friday-message-god-has-last-word"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CARDINAL DOLAN OF NEW YORK REVEALS HIS

  we have set our sights on fixing what only God can fix. Our job is not to fix the
  broken world — but to endure faithfully within it. If we long for the restoration
  of all things, we must first focus on living ‘lives of holiness and godliness, waiting
  for and hastening the day of God’ (2 Peter 3:11-12)." </p><p>Spencer said that "as
  we live such lives, we will ultimately find ourselves loving our neighbor, caring
  for the vulnerable and proclaiming the gospel in word and deed."</p><p>In line with
  this, he said that "our world doesn’t need to change for us to serve Christ (1 Cor
  7:17-24). We serve Christ until the world around us changes and then we serve Christ
  some more."</p><p>And third, he said, is a potential "final lesson."</p><p>In the
  Garden of Gethsemane, "Jesus prayed and, in doing so, reaffirmed His willingness
  to submit to the Father’s will," Spencer told Fox News Digital via email. </p><p><a

  not want the pain and suffering He saw coming. He wanted to accomplish the work
  of providing a way for salvation for all who believe without the anguish of the
  cross." </p><p>And yet — "in the end, Jesus wanted something else more: He wanted
  the Father’s will to be done rather than His own (Matt. 26:39)." </p><p>Spencer
  added that "political and social pressure may be necessary on occasion … Still,
  we need to cultivate the deep conviction of Christ so that we, too, may say, ‘Not
  as I will, but as you will.’"</p><p>He also said, "The world needs to see the difference
  Christ makes. As such, in this moment (and a multitude of others), we must respond
  to Christ rather than [the world]." </p><p>If we do this, he said, "the world will
  not see our indignation or moral outrage but our unwavering loyalty to a risen Savior
  and Lord who has authority over all things in heaven and on Earth."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-demands-biden-issue-apology-over-blasphemous-trans-visibility-day-easter-sunday-appalling"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Trump campaign</a><a rel="noopener">,</a> among
  others, blasted the White House for the Biden TDOV proclamation.</p><p>"We call
  on Joe Biden’s failing campaign and White House to issue an apology to the millions
  of Catholics and Christians across America who believe [Easter Sunday] is for one
  celebration only — the resurrection of Jesus Christ," said Karoline Leavitt, the
  Trump campaign’s press secretary.</p><p>The Biden White House stood by its March
  29 proclamation. </p><p>"Transgender Americans are part of the fabric of our Nation,"
  the White House said in its statement on March 29th. "Whether serving their communities
  or in the military, raising families or running businesses, they help America thrive.
  They deserve, and are entitled to, the same rights and freedoms as every other American,
  including the most fundamental freedom to be their true selves."</p><p><i>Fox News
