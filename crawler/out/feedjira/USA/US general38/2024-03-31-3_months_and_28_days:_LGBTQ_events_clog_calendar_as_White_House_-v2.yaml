content: <p>Amid backlash <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">about the White House proclaiming</a> Transgender
  Day of Visibility on Easter Sunday, Fox News Digital found an extensive list of
  LGBT-focused holidays celebrated throughout the year, including a handful recognized
  by the White House. </p><p>"On Transgender Day of Visibility, we honor the extraordinary
  courage and contributions of transgender Americans and reaffirm our Nation’s commitment
  to forming a more perfect Union — where all people are created equal and treated
  equally throughout their lives," said a White House statement recognizing Transgender
  Day of Visibility on Easter Sunday, the most holy holiday for Christians. </p><p>"Today,
  we send a message to all transgender Americans: You are loved. You are heard. You
  are understood. You belong. You are America, and my entire Administration and I
  have your back," it added. </p><p>"Now, therefore, I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., President
  of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
  Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 31, 2024,
  as Transgender Day of Visibility."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-slammed-social-media-announcing-transgender-day-visibility-easter-sunday"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BIDEN SLAMMED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER ANNOUNCING
  TRANSGENDER DAY OF VISIBILITY ON EASTER SUNDAY</strong></a></p><p>Conservatives
  and other critics of the White House ripped the decision to recognize Transgender
  Day of Visibility on Easter, calling it an attack on Christianity. International
  Transgender Day of Visibility was created by activists more than 10 years ago and
  is celebrated each year on March 31, while the date of Easter Sunday changes from
  year to year. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/americans-arent-buying-bidens-devout-catholic-label-poll-finds"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>AMERICANS AREN'T BUYING BIDEN'S 'DEVOUT
  CATHOLIC' LABEL, POLL FINDS</u></strong></a></p><p>The Trump campaign called on
  Biden to apologize for the proclamation. </p><p>"<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">We call on Joe Biden's failing</a> campaign and the
  White House to issue an apology to the millions of Catholics and Christians across
  America who believe tomorrow is for one celebration only — the resurrection of Jesus
  Christ," Karoline Leavitt said. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-skewered-worlds-worst-catholic-cheapens-irish-catholic-identity"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>BIDEN SKEWERED AS 'WORLD’S WORST CATHOLIC'
  WHO CHEAPENS IRISH AND CATHOLIC IDENTITY</u></strong></a></p><p>Others on <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/social-media"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a> pointed out that cities, universities,
  LGBT organizations and government officials celebrate similar calendar events throughout
  the year. Fox News Digital found at least 28 other related holidays celebrated in
  the U.S., including International Asexuality Day, International Day of Pink, Day
  of Silence, Harvey Milk Day, Pansexual and Panromantic Awareness Day and International
  Drag Day. </p><p>There are also entire months devoted to LGBT causes or commemorations,
  including Pride Month in June, LGBT History Month in October and Transgender Awareness
  Month in November. </p><p>Not every holiday throughout the year is recognized by
  the White House or high-ranking lawmakers, but holidays are celebrated by advocacy
  groups in cities such as Seattle or on college campuses. </p><p>The Biden White
  House has celebrated at least seven other holidays celebrating and commemorating
  LGBT issues, including National Coming Out Day in October; Lesbian Day of Visibility
  in April; International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia in May;
  Pride Month in June; Spirit Day in October; Intersex Awareness Day in October; and
  Transgender Day of Remembrance in November. </p><p>The Biden administration has
  celebrated Transgender Day of Visibility each year since 2021 on March 31, and White
  House spokesman Andrew Bates said Biden, as a Christian, is working to bring "people
  together" with the event. </p><p>"As a Christian who celebrates Easter with family,
  President Biden stands for bringing people together and upholding the dignity and
  freedoms of every American," Bates said in comment to Fox News Digital on Sunday. </p><p><a

  target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WHITE HOUSE DOUBLES DOWN ON INCLUSIVENESS
  MESSAGE AMID BACKLASH OVER TRANSGENDER DAY OF VISIBILITY ON EASTER</strong></a></p><p>"Sadly,
  it’s unsurprising politicians are seeking to divide and weaken our country with
  cruel, hateful and dishonest rhetoric. President Biden will never abuse his faith
  for political purposes or for profit."</p><p>Biden, who is Catholic, did post a
  message Sunday celebrating Easter and Jesus’ resurrection. </p><p>"Jill and I send
  our warmest wishes to Christians around the world celebrating the power of hope
  and the promise of Christ’s Resurrection this Easter Sunday," he posted Sunday morning. </p><p>The
  Biden administration has a long history promoting and supporting <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/diversity"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">the LGBT community, including last year</a> when
  the president hosted the White House’s largest Pride celebration in its history,
  according to Reuters. Biden has repeatedly vowed to combat discrimination against
  the gay community and spoke in support of the trans community during his State of
  the Union address earlier this month. </p><p>The White House has previously come
  under fire from critics during events heralding the LGBT community, including last
  year when a transgender model and activist took off her top at a Pride event at
  the White House and cupped her breasts in photos and for inviting an anti-police
  nonbinary drag queen to attend the Respect for Marriage Act signing in 2022. </p><p>Republicans
  have continued hammering the Biden administration online for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/occasions/holiday"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrating the holiday on the same</a> day as Easter. </p>
