  <p>A grand jury has formally charged a 22-year-old man with capital murder and rape in the death of Nabra Hassanen, who was killed on her walk back to a Virginia mosque.</p>
  <p>The Fairfax County Circuit Court indicted Darwin Martinez-Torres of Sterling, Virginia, on Monday on four counts of capital murder for killing Nabra, who was with friends while they had a meal before Ramadan services. Dozens of people had gathered outside the courthouse today, <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMurilloWTOP/status/918910737573171201">chanting &#8220;Justice for Nabra.&#8221;</a></p>
  <p>Virginia law has specific conditions for pursuing the death penalty, but the Associated Press reported that the grand jury&#8217;s indictment described in graphic detail how Nabra&#8217;s killing was <a href="https://apnews.com/950a9642c9c84840a8a11535ecd5fcbb?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=APSouthRegion">grounds for a death penalty</a> against Martinez-Torres. The indictment appears to acknowledge for the first time that the 17-year-old Muslim teen was raped. Under state law, the combination of a rape charge with a premeditated murder charge means the death penalty can be pursued.</p>
  <p>Police have said that Martinez-Torres, who is an undocumented immigrant, got into a confrontation on June 18 with a group of teens walking back to the All Dulles Area Muslim Society after grabbing a late meal. He is accused of returning later and beating Nabra with a baseball bat. Police said Nabra&#8217;s body was later discovered in a pond. A search warrant affidavit revealed that Martinez-Torres admitted to killing Nabra and had led authorities to where he dumped her body, AP reported.</p>
  <p>Nabra&#8217;s parents and Muslim advocates have said that Nabra&#8217;s death was motivated by hate, but police has said that they will not treat the killing as a hate crime. Instead, police have said it was a <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/police-say-17-year-old-girl-killed-road-rage-incident-near-mosque/">road rage incident</a>.</p>
  <p>“The reason this guy he hit my daughter is because she’s Muslim,” Nabra&#8217;s father Mahmoud Hassanen <a href="http://wamu.org/story/17/10/13/man-accused-murder-nabra-hassanen-heads-court/">told WAMU</a>. “Why [didn’t he] hit the boy who bothered him?”</p>
  <p>Nabra&#8217;s father added that he hoped for the death penalty, while her mother said she wanted Martinez-Torres to serve life in prison.</p>
  <p>“I just want people to remember her, and don’t forget her,” Mahmoud told WAMU. “I think nobody can forget her too, for what she did in her life.”</p>
  <p>A preliminary hearing for Martinez-Torres reportedly <a href="http://www.fox5dc.com/news/local-news/nabra-hassanens-family-has-outburst-in-hearing-after-seeing-accused-killer">turned emotional</a> on Friday, with Nabra&#8217;s parents both shouting at the suspect in court. Nabra&#8217;s mother Sawsan Gazzar apparently threw a shoe at Martinez-Torres during the proceedings.</p>
