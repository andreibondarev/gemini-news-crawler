  <p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump says the U.S. stands with Greece as they recover from their economic crisis. He is speaking with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras at the White House in a joint news conference.</p>
  <p>The U.S. president says the two leaders have discussed defense, energy, commerce and trade.</p>
  <p>Trump is praising Greece for its defense spending under NATO and is noting a potential sale to Greece to upgrade its F-16 aircraft, which he says would be worth up to $2.4 billion and generate thousands of U.S. jobs.</p>
  <p>Tsipras says his country has made economic strides and is &#8220;leaving behind the economic model that led to the crisis.&#8221; He says Greece&#8217;s relationship with the U.S. is &#8220;more important than ever.&#8221;</p>
