  <p>But beyond the words, Xi is asserting power like no Chinese leader in decades.</p>
  <p>William Brangham reports.</p>
  <p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> The applause, the music, it was a reception befitting the commanding role that Xi Jinping has taken since being named party leader five years ago.</p>
  <p>He opened today&#8217;s proceedings by hailing reforms he&#8217;s put in place, and proclaiming a &#8212; quote &#8212; &#8220;new era for China.&#8221;</p>
  <p><strong>PRESIDENT XI JINPING,</strong> China (through interpreter): The Chinese nation has realized a great leap, from declining in modern history to twisting its fate fundamentally and continuously moving to prosperity.</p>
  <p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> Over 3.5 hours, Xi laid out his vision to shape the nation of 1.4 billion people into what he called a &#8212; quote &#8212; &#8220;great modern socialist country&#8221; over the next three decades.</p>
  <p><strong>PRESIDENT XI JINPING</strong> (through interpreter): Achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will be no walk in the park, and it will take more than drumbeating and gong-clanging to get there. The whole party must be prepared to make more arduous, strenuous efforts.</p>
  <p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> Susan Shirk is chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego.</p>
  <p><strong>SUSAN SHIRK,</strong> University of California, San Diego: Xi Jinping has a vision of China&#8217;s role in the world that is much more ambitious than anything we have seen before, talking about China kind of moving toward the center of the world and having a lot more influence than it did before.</p>
  <p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> In his address, Xi largely ignored the question of political reforms in China, and he didn&#8217;t mention President Trump or North Korea&#8217;s nuclear weapons program.</p>
  <p>But in a rare move, he did acknowledge that with global demand weakening, there were challenges facing China&#8217;s export-driven economy.</p>
  <p><strong>PRESIDENT XI JINPING</strong> (through interpreter):  While China&#8217;s overall productive forces have significantly improved and in many areas our production capacity leads the world, the more prominent problem is that our development is unbalanced and inadequate.</p>
  <p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> Xi was one of the first foreign leaders to meet with President Trump.</p>
  <p><strong>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:</strong> The relationship developed by President Xi and myself, I think, is outstanding.</p>
  <p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> That was decidedly warmer than Mr. Trump&#8217;s past criticism of China and its economic and trade policies.</p>
  <p>But other U.S. officials are more critical of Beijing&#8217;s actions.</p>
  <p><strong>REX TILLERSON,</strong> Secretary of State: China, while rising alongside India, has done so less responsibly.</p>
  <p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> Secretary of State Rex Tillerson today criticized China&#8217;s aggressive displays of economic and military power, particularly its expansion on man-made islands in the South China Sea.</p>
  <p><strong>REX TILLERSON:</strong> We will not shrink from China&#8217;s challenges to the rules-based order, and where China subverts the sovereignty of neighboring countries and disadvantages the U.S. and our friends.</p>
  <p><strong>SUSAN SHIRK:</strong> I think there are things to worry about in Chinese foreign policy that are mostly related to these maritime sovereignty issues and to a kind of bullying in Asia, but the global ambition could turn out to be positive.</p>
  <p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> Susan Shirk says China has filled a vacuum left by the United States&#8217; withdrawal from global agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate accords.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the most important thing to watch for in the next few days is who Xi establishes as his likely successor.</p>
  <p><strong>SUSAN SHIRK:</strong> That is why there is a lot of speculation now that he may be trying, much like Putin, to stay on beyond his normal term or to rule behind the scenes even after he retires.</p>
  <p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> President Trump will be traveling to Beijing to meet Xi next month.</p>
