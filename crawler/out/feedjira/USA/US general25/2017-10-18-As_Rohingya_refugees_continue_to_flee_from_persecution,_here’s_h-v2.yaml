  <p>More than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled their homes since August to <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/500000-rohingya-flee-rape-fire-murder-myanmar/">escape systematic violence</a> at the hands of government soldiers in Myanmar. The U.N. has called the actions taken by Myanmar forces against the group <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/500000-rohingya-flee-rape-fire-murder-myanmar/">“a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.”</a></p>
  <p>A <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa16/7288/2017/en/">report released by Amnesty International</a> on Wednesday documents widespread rape, killings and burnings of Rohingya across the Rakhine State in Myanmar. The report includes extensive interviews of Rohingya refugees who tell stories of live burnings, sexual violence and mass shootings at the hands of soldiers. </p>
  <p>To escape persecution, Rohingya refugees are <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/flooding-bangladesh-rohingya-refugees-flee-harrowing-violence/">fleeing in droves</a> to neighboring Bangladesh, a country described by some as a <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/10/16/558042344/for-half-a-million-rohingya-fleeing-myanmar-bangladesh-is-a-reluctant-host">reluctant host</a> for the thousands of refugees behind its borders.

  <p>Officials from Myanmar, a majority Buddhist state, claim Rohingya are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/world/asia/myanmar-rohingya-muslim.html">actually immigrants</a> from Bangladesh to justify their exclusion of the group. This most recent burst of violence comes from <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/rohingya-crisis">Myanmar’s crackdown</a> following clashes with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA).
