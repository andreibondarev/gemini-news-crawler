title: Michael Douglas on "Franklin," and playing a founding father
url: https://www.cbsnews.com/video/michael-douglas-on-franklin-and-playing-a-founding-father/
summary: He was the son of actors, but Michael Douglas says he was reluctant to follow
  in the deep footsteps of his father, Kirk Douglas. But as an Oscar-winning producer
  and performer, Michael has earned his own legendary status. He now stars as the
  revolutionary figure Benjamin Franklin in the Apple TV+ series "Franklin." He tells
  correspondent Mo Rocca that the show's story, about the founding father's efforts
  to save a burgeoning democracy, is timely given today's dangerous political climate.
