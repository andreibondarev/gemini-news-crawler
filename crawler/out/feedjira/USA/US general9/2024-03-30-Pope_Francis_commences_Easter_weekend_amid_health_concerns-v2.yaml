summary: Pope Francis presided over a nearly two-hour-long vigil to commence Easter
  weekend amid ongoing health concerns. The 87-year-old canceled his Friday appearance
  at the Roman Colosseum for the Way of the Cross as the Vatican said they wanted
  to preserve his health ahead of the weekend. The Pope battled colds and respiratory
  challenges throughout the winter. NBC Newsâ€™ Meagan Fitzgerald reports.
