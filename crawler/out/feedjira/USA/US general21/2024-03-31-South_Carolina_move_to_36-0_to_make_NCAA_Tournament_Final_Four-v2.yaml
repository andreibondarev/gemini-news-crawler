summary: <ul><li>Oregon State 58-70 South Carolina</li><li>Gamecocks aim for first
  undefeated season since 2016</li></ul><p>Tessa Johnson scored 15 points, Kamilla
  Cardoso added 12 and undefeated South Carolina advanced to the Final Four of the
  women’s NCAA Tournament with a 70-58 win over Oregon State on Sunday.<br><br>South
  Carolina made it to the national semifinals unbeaten for the second straight season.
  The Gamecocks lost to Caitlin Clark and Iowa in the Final Four last year. This time,
  with an entirely new starting lineup, coach Dawn Staley has her group on the verge
  of the school’s third national championship.<br><br>The Gamecocks, who have made
  the Final Four in four straight years, will play either Texas or NC State on Friday
  night in Cleveland. Two more wins by South Carolina would make the Gamecocks the
  10th school to finish a season undefeated and the first since UConn did so in 2016.<br><br>Top-seeded
  South Carolina (36-0) led by four at the half and built a 14-point lead before No
  3 seed Oregon State (27-8) closed the score to 62-58 with 3:55 left in the game.
  But the Beavers missed their final seven shots.<br><br>Johnson answered after a
  timeout with a three-point play, scoring on a drive to restore a seven-point cushion.
  No one scored until Johnson made two free throws with 44.5 seconds left. Raegan
  Beers scored 16 points to lead the Beavers.<br><br>This was the second straight
  game in the Albany 1 Region where South Carolina let a double-digit second-half
  lead slip away. Just as they did against Indiana in the regional semifinal, the
  young Gamecocks made the necessary plays down the stretch.<br><br>South Carolina
  led 43-41 before scoring 12 straight points in the third quarter. Raven Johnson,
  who hit the big 3-pointer to beat Indiana in the Sweet 16, connected on a corner
  3 to start the game-changing spurt. Tessa Johnson followed with five straight points,
  and Sania Feagin capped the burst with the four points that made it 55-41 with 1:36
  left in the third quarter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/31/south-carolina-move-to-36-0-to-make-ncaa-tournament-final-four">Continue
