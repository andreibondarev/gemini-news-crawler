summary: <p>Live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets as
  minister says water company’s leadership has been a ‘disgrace’</p><p><strong>The
  UK government has said it is prepared for “a range of scenarios” for Thames Water.</strong></p><p>A
  government spokesperson said:</p><p>Like any company needing to secure new investment
  there are a wide range of options available to water companies, including the injection
  of new equity from any prospective investors.</p><p>Ofwat, as the financial regulator
  of the water sector, continues to engage with Thames Water to improve its financial
  resilience.</p><p>I don’t want to pollute rivers, and nor does anyone in Thames
  Water. I would point out that <em>E coli</em> has many different sources. It’s not
  just from sewage; it’s also from land run-off, it is from highway run-off; it is
  from animal faeces. All of those things contribute to the problem.</p><p>And I am
  absolutely determined that at Thames, that we will pay our part in cleaning up the
  problem, and so the Thames is a river that people can use as they would like to
  every day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/mar/28/thames-water-crisis-sewage-rivers-funding-uk-recession-gdp-economy-sterling-business-live">Continue
