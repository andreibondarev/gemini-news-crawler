title: From the playground to politics, it’s the bullies who rule. But it doesn’t
  have to be this way | George Monbiot

summary: <p>At every stage of our lives we are forced into destructive competition.

  and impressive study</a> of children’s progress into adulthood found that those
  who display bullying and aggressive behaviour at school are more likely to prosper
  at work. They land better jobs and earn more. The researchers claim to be surprised
  by their findings, but is it really so remarkable? The association of senior positions
  with bullying and dominance behaviour will doubtless come as a shock to many.</p><p>This
  is not to suggest that all people with good jobs or who run organisations are bullies.
  Far from it. It’s not hard to think of good people in powerful positions. What this
  tells us is that we don’t need aggressive people to organise our lives for us. Neither
  good leadership, nor organisational success, nor innovation, insight or foresight,
  require a dominance mindset. In fact, all can be inhibited by someone throwing their
  weight around.</p><p>George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/30/playground-politics-bullies-competition">Continue
