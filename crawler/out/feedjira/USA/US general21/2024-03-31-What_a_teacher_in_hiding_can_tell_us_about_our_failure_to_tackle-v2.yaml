summary: <p>A class about free speech was cynically exploited by activists to incite
  fury in a local community</p><p>Three years ago, on 25&nbsp;March 2021, a teacher
  from Batley Grammar School (BGS) in West Yorkshire was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/west-yorkshire-news/devastated-batley-teacher-fearing-life-20282177">forced
  into hiding</a> after a religious studies class he gave led to&nbsp;protests from
  Muslim parents <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/mar/25/batley-head-apologises-for-teacher-using-charlie-hebdo-cartoons">and&nbsp;to
  death threats</a>. Today, that incident has been largely forgotten. Except by the
  teacher. He can’t forget it because, extraordinarily, he and his family are still
  in hiding. Equally extraordinarily, little is said about this.</p><p>The debate
  about the events at BGS, like many about Islam, blasphemy and offence, has been
  framed by two polarised arguments. Many on the reactionary right (and not just the
  reactionary right) view such confrontations as the unacceptable price of mass immigration
  and the inevitable product of a Muslim presence in western societies. Many liberals
  and radicals, on the other hand, think it morally wrong to cause offence, believing
  that for diverse societies to function, there is a need to self-censor so as not
  to disrespect different cultures and beliefs. Neither argument bears much scrutiny.
  The most comprehensive account of the events at BGS comes in a review <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65fdbfd265ca2ffef17da79c/The_Khan_review.pdf">published
  last week by Sara Khan</a>, the government’s independent adviser on “social cohesion
  and resilience”. The lesson that sparked the controversy was designed, ironically,
  to explore issues of blasphemy and free speech, and of appropriate ways of responding
  to religious disagreements.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/31/batley-school-what-teacher-in-hiding-can-tell-us-about-our-failure-to-tackle-intolerance">Continue
