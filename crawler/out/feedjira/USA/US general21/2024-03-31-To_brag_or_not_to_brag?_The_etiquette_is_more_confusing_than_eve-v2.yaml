title: To brag or not to brag? The etiquette is more confusing than ever | Emma Beddington

summary: '<p>Do you shout your achievements from the rooftops, or ‘move in silence’
  while waiting for the perfect moment to flex online? If only we could all sit this
  one out</p><p>I have belatedly discovered the phrase “move in silence”. Apparently,
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/lil-wayne">Lil Wayne</a> instructed people
  to do it in 2011 with the line: “Real Gs move in silence like lasagne,” a lyric
  that prompted various polemics (is the G in lasagne <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/lil-wayne-lasagna-line-in-67-causes-controversy-thoughts-949210/">actually
  silent</a>?). Even then, a music commentator told Billboard it was “such an old
  concept”. It hadn’t broken through in the south side of Brussels, where I was living
  then (despite lasagne, happily, being plentiful).</p><p>I was finally alerted to
  “moving in silence” by an Instagram post. The phrase grabbed me, since I am a cheerleader
  for silence. My take is: the more people move in silence, the better, especially
  if they are in coach H of the 8.02 York to London King’s Cross. It’s the “Quieter”
  coach! Don’t make me stare pointedly at the sign and sigh!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/31/brag-etiquette-more-confusing-than-ever-emma-beddington">Continue
