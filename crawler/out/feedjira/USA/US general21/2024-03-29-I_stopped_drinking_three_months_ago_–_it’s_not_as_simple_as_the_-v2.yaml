title: I stopped drinking three months ago – it’s not as simple as the internet makes
  it look | Ashe Davenport

summary: '<p>Influencer sobriety is a world where alcohol addiction is history, but
  it’s all too neat</p><p>At a glance, sobriety looks pretty on social media – and
  relatively simple to achieve. A quick search<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/mar/21/australia-alcohol-tax-system-rise-spirits-beer-costs-percentage">
  for sober motivation</a> will send you off on a stream of brightly coloured listicles
  that advise making plans that don’t involve alcohol, spending time with friends
  who support your choices, trying new things (like mocktails!) and going for a walk
  to combat alcohol cravings. The posts are often accompanied by a white-toothed influencer
  who is standing on a mountain in a bikini.</p><p>The internet paints a picture of
  sobriety that has been smoothed around the edges, with an occasional snag of vulnerability;
  a woman pushing her toddler on a swing with the caption “I was buzzed on vodka here”;
  a word tile that reads: “I realised that inebriated women are easier to control.”
  The darkness creeps in, but then it’s back to normal programming; memes and hashtags
  and journalling at sunrise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/30/giving-up-drinking-alcohol-tips-advice">Continue
