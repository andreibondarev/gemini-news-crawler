  twist at the Oscars</a> was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fmanjoo/status/836085336027455489\">seen</a>
  to echo all the last-minute twists in American culture lately—the Super Bowl, the
  election—a silly <a href=\"http://abc.go.com/shows/oscars/video/most-recent/VDKA3703864\">five-minute
  segment</a> earlier in the night should be noted for what it captured about the
  country’s ongoing tensions and tastes in iPhone peripherals.</p>\n\n<p>Host Jimmy
  Kimmel’s team arranged for a sightseeing bus of supposedly “real” tourists to walk
  into the room, expecting a museum exhibit about the Oscars but instead finding themselves
  in the middle of the actual thing. “Welcome to the Dolby Theater,” Kimmel announced.
  “This is the home of the Academy Awards, which are, in fact, happening right now.”</p>\n\n<blockquote

  27, 2017</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"
  charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<p>The bit was both amusing and squirmy: a weird
  microcosm of Hollywood’s relationship with America, America’s relationship with
  the media, and Jimmy Kimmel’s ability to make everything a little more awkward than
  it needs to be.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"></aside>\n\n<h4><font
  face=\"Lyon Display, Georgia, Times, serif\">The Hunger for Folk Heroes (and Memes)</font></h4>\n\n<p>At
  the front of the pack was the man who would be the moment’s breakout star, “Gary
  from Chicago.” In a room of tuxes, he wore basketball shorts, a baseball cap, and
  a “Hollywood” sweatshirt, with the gender-progressive touches of a purple phone
  case and a bag that might have been his fiancee’s purse. If the glitz ambush intimidated
  him, he showed no signs of it, happily introducing himself to stars and snappily
  replying to Kimmel’s jokes. On social media, pop culture’s craving for quirky symbolic
  everymen—see: Ken Bone, Joe the Plumber—quickly <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/movies/oscars-audience-wonders-who-is-gary-from-chicago.html?_r=0\">made
  itself known</a>. So did the cravings of<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ginoseast/status/836059060168425472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">various
  corporate marketing teams</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Our Collective Phone Addiction</h4>\n\n<p>The
  dozen or so tourists seemed to realize what was happening at different rates, and
  with different emotions—fear, elation, nonchalance—but were united in keeping their
  phones in front of their faces. “You know we’re on TV so you don’t need to do that,”
  Kimmel said as Gary kept filming the room. His reply: “I know but I want to. I want
  to.”</p>\n\n<p>The phone accessories themselves could make for a post-show fashion
  column: one woman had a sparkling jeweled case, another wielded a selfie stick as
  if it were a talisman. Devices in hand, the group pulled celebs in for selfies;
  Gary even handed his phone to Mahershala Ali as he posed with the actor’s Oscar.</p>\n\n<p>For
  the tourists, it was a rare chance to see in the flesh people normally only ever
  seen on a screen. Yet they still insisted on having a screen between them.</p>\n\n<h4>Piercing
  the Hollywood Bubble …</h4>\n\n<p>In an era when Americans have become sharply aware
  of how isolated its various niches are—politically, socially, geographically—workaday
  citizens from around the country were literally bussed in for cultural exchange
  with the cultural elite. The stars received them warmly: Ryan Gosling offered up
  some sort of present to Gary, Jennifer Anniston handed over her sunglasses, Meryl
  and Mahershala and others grinned and hugged. Denzel Washington even<strong> </strong>“married”<strong>
  </strong>Gary and his fiancee Vicky, though it must be said this particular cinematic
  icon seemed in a bit of a hurry to return to his seat.</p>\n\n<h4>… or Reinforcing
  It</h4>\n\n<p>The alternate political reading of the moment was that the regular
  folks were treated patronizingly, expected to react with gratitude and awe at the
  mere fact of breathing the same air as famous people. Kimmel seemed a little too
  insistent that the tourists be wowed, and an awkward image was set when Gary started
  kissing actresses’ hands: He wanted to do it, but it looked a lot like royalty receiving
  a supplicant. “Well that was the most condescending moment in Oscars<strike> </strike>history,”
  the writer Walter Kirn <a href=\"https://twitter.com/walterkirn/status/836054075263217664\">tweeted</a>.
  “Real people on parade. Weren’t they cute?”</p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" height=\"390\"

  face=\"Lyon Display, Georgia, Times, serif\">Oscars (Host) So White</font></h4>\n\n<p>The
  tourists were a mix of white and black and brown men and women. But Kimmel made
  the diversity seem anything but normal by using tired humor about “funny” names—which
  is to say, names unusual to white Americans. As the tourists entered the room, he
  had the crowd shout out “MAHERSHALA!,” the name of <em>Moonlight</em>’s Best Supporting
  Actor winner. Later, Kimmel reacted with horror when a woman of Asian descent told
  Kimmel her name rhymed with “jewelry.” When her husband said his name was Patrick,
  Kimmel replied with mock relief, “See, that’s a name.”</p>\n\n<p>At an event that
  has recently been accused of white supremacy, this was a pretty tone-deaf shtick.
  But Gary, of course, helped deflate it. “I feel like you’re ignoring the white celebrities,”
  Kimmel said. Gary: “Because I am, though!”</p>\n\n<h4><font face=\"Lyon Display,
  Georgia, Times, serif\">The Insanity of Live TV</font></h4>\n\n<p>My stress reflexes
  were in full effect watching the segment, and judging from the cringing reactions
  on Twitter, I wasn’t alone. It’s definitely possible the tourists were just actors,
  or that they’d at least been coached to a greater extent than we were led to believe.
  But still, the spectacle of chaos in a space as highly choreographed, as widely
  watched, and as culturally fraught as the Oscars was riveting. At the very end of
  the night, viewers would be reminded of what makes live TV like this so electrifying—the
  potential for disaster, and miracles.</p>\n"
