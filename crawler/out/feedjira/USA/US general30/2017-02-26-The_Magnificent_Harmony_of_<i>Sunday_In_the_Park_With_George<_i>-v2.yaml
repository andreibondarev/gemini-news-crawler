  currently playing in a limited run at New York’s Hudson Theatre starring Jake Gyllenhaal,
  is blissfully free of politics—a two-and-a-half hour respite from contemporary anxieties,
  a holiday on the banks of the Seine, bathed in sunlight and glorious harmony. And
  yet, without ever straining to, it makes one of the most persuasive cases imaginable
  for the power of artists, and how deeply integral their work is to a well-ordered
  society. Art shows us, as Gyllenhaal’s George demonstrates to his mother in one
  of the first act’s most moving songs, how life can be beautiful.</p>\n\n<p>But rather
  than simply celebrating the fruits of creative labor, <em>Sunday In the Park </em>is
  a testament to the <em>process</em> of making art; a substantial peek inside the
  mind of someone wrestling with their own genius. When the show—with music and lyrics
  by Stephen Sondheim and book by James Lapine—debuted in 1984, it was interpreted
  as one of Sondheim’s most personal expressions, coming on the heels of his critical
  and financial bomb, <em>Merrily We Roll Along.</em> George, the show’s hero, is
  obsessed with his paintings, to the detriment of everything else in his life. But
  as the show unfolds, moving from 19th-century France to 1980s Chicago, it explores
  the reasoning behind his single-minded fixation, and how George’s role as an observer
  lets everyone else see the world differently, too.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"callout-placeholder\"
  data-source=\"curated\"></aside>\n\n<p>That’s largely because this revival, directed
  by Sarna Lapine (James Lapine’s niece), is so magnificent and so emotionally rich,
  anchored by performances by Gyllenhaal and Annaleigh Ashford as George’s mistress
  and artist’s model, Dot. The show is based around Georges Seurat’s 1884 pointillist
  masterwork, <em>A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, </em>and George
  is a loose version of Seurat, with his life broadly fictionalized. As he sketches
  studies of Dot, who grumbles about the discomfort, the heat, and George’s fierce
  focus on his work, projections of his sketches appear on a backdrop onstage, rendered
  for the audience to witness in real time. All the while George narrates his thought
  process: the challenge of bringing order and harmony to a blank canvas.</p>\n\n<p>Gyllenhaal’s
  gifts as an actor are well-documented by now, so it’s his vocal talents that may
  come as a surprise (observe, if you haven’t already, Cary Fukunaga’s short <a href=\"http://www.indiewire.com/2017/02/jake-gyllenhaal-sunday-in-the-park-with-george-cary-fukunaga-1201779232/\">video</a>
  of Gyllenhaal singing George’s “Finishing the Hat” at the Hudson). His voice is
  rich, measured, and emphatic. But it’s the acting behind it that really cuts deep,
  in a remarkable fusion of technical accomplishment and intense absorption in a role.
  When he sings about mapping out a sky, sensing voices outside but being totally
  lost in focus, “dizzy from the height” of falling back to earth, you’re tempted,
  like Dot, to forgive him everything.</p>\n\n<p>Ashford, who won a Tony for the 2014
  revival of the<strong> </strong>daffy comedy <em>You Can’t Take It With You</em>,
  is George’s perfect foil as Dot: sassy, practical, and infinitely charming. But
  she also conveys the exquisite pain of loving someone so inaccessible, and her chemistry
  with Gyllenhaal is pure. Toward the end of the first act, when<strong> </strong>George<strong>
  </strong>directs the many elements and characters to come together in a synergy
  of music and visuals, he places Dot<strong> </strong>at the front of the “painting,”
  as if to keep her close. But the supporting cast, too, are adept at bringing comic
  relief, and balancing the harmony of the show: Robert Sean Leonard as Jules, an
  accomplished artist; Penny Fuller as George’s mother, lost in nostalgia; Phillip
  Boykin as a foulmouthed and obstreperous boatman. The peripheral characters by their
  nature are fleeting archetypes, included to provide contrast with the more textured
  portrayals of George and Dot.</p>\n\n<p>The second act of <i>Sunday In the Park</i>,
  which leaps ahead to 1984—with Gyllenhaal playing another artist named George and
  Ashford his grandmother, Marie, Dot’s daughter—has often seemed jarring after the
  perfection of the first act, but Lapine manages to make the two halves more symbiotic
  by emphasizing how George’s art is tied to his great-grandfather’s. Just as Seurat
  used pointillism and the science of light to create new colors and impressions,
  1984 George debuts a light installation called a “chromolume” at the Art Institute
  of Chicago. The work, created by the scenic designer Beowulf Boritt, looms above
  the audience in a dazzling display of illuminations, weaving and undulating overhead.
  Ashford, seamlessly segueing into playing a 90-year-old southern grandmother, spells
  out George’s isolation and creative frustration in “Children and Art,” a song addressed
  to her mother in the painting. The cracks in her vocals, and the deliberate weakness
  of Marie’s voice, make it one of the most moving numbers in the show.</p>\n\n<p>Modern
  George’s frustrations are different but rooted in the same fears—unlike his great-grandfather,
  he has to fundraise for his expensive, technologically advanced works, and respond
  to the criticism it inevitably receives. But in the song “Move On,” it becomes clear
  that the two are one and the same, straining to make art that counts, and to do
  something new. The resolution in the show comes from realizing that just doing the
  work is enough—everything else is out of an artist’s hands. This production, so
  deftly directed, emphasizes both the value in the struggle, and the timelessness
  of great art. It’s powerful indeed to have the experience, even briefly, of seeing
  the world through the eyes of a visionary.</p>\n"
