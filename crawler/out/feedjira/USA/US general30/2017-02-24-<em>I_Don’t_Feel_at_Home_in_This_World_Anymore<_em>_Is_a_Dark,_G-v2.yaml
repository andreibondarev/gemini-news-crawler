  an exasperated petty criminal asks Ruth Kimke (Melanie Lynskey), who’s in the middle
  of the strange vigilante rampage at the heart of the new film <em>I Don’t Feel at
  Home in This World Anymore</em>. Ruth thinks for a second. “For people to not be
  assholes!” she replies, which feels as good a battle cry as any in these angry,
  polarized times. Ruth is a fitting anti-hero for 2017: She’s depressed, she’s being
  taken for granted in her job, and she has no idea where to direct her resentment.</p>\n\n<p>So
  when it does come spilling out, it has all kinds of unintended consequences, some
  comical and others decidedly not. The debut film from Macon Blair, <em>I Don’t Feel
  at Home in This World Anymore</em> is a shambling piece of neo-noir that swerves
  between gentle indie comedy and horrifying violence with ease—a combination that
  helped it win this year’s Sundance Film Festival Jury Prize. The movie, released
  Friday on Netflix, is grounded by Blair’s eye for the gruesome, which he surely
  picked up working as an actor on projects like Jeremy Saulnier’s gory <em><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/04/green-room-jeremy-saulnier-review/479244/\">Green
  Room</a></em>. At its best, Blair’s film is like <em>Blood Simple</em> crossed with
  The Three Stooges—a clever, gritty tale of revenge at its most inept, anchored by
  performances that brim with goofy fury.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"callout-placeholder\"
  data-source=\"curated\"></aside>\n\n<p>The protagonist, Ruth, is a nurse living
  a fairly dull life in an unnamed town. Blair takes special care to focus on the
  tiny, insignificant details that clearly weigh on her, whether it’s someone cutting
  in front of her at the supermarket, or a local dog constantly using her front yard
  as a bathroom. When Ruth’s home is burglarized, the loss of her possessions seems
  to matter less than the sheer indignity of the matter. The local cops do little
  more than take a report, leading her to decide to take the matter in her own hands.</p>\n\n<p>But
  <em>I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore</em> is less like Joel Schumacher’s
  <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_Down\">Falling Down</a> </em>than
  it sounds, at least for most of its running time. Ruth’s confused mission is largely
  focused on finding her stuff at local pawn shops and taking it back; she’s more
  interested in reclaiming a little pride than in finding her laptop. She enlists
  her weirdo neighbor Tony (played by Elijah Wood) as backup, drawn to (if disgusted
  by) his shamelessness in letting his dog defecate on her property.</p>\n\n<p>Tony
  is the kind of neighbor you’d probably try to avoid interacting with too much if
  he lived near you; he has a collection of nunchucks and ninja stars but little social
  aptitude. But he proves a perfect companion for Ruth, and is eager to use her quest
  for some ineffable sort of justice as an outlet for his own boundless rage. They’re
  an odd pair of heroes to root for, and there is something darkly alluring about
  watching them run amok. Ruth finally secures some small moments of petty triumph—that
  is, until she meets the shady perpetrators of her burglary and things really descend
  into chaos.</p>\n\n<p>Blair started out as an actor working with his childhood friend
  Saulnier, the American indie-horror director who expertly deploys very realistic,
  very shocking scenes of violence in films like <em>Green Room</em> and <em>Blue
  Ruin</em>. So <em>I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore</em>’s eventual nightmarish
  turn makes sense, and there’s certainly something to be said for the bloody creativity
  on display. But as the film goes on, it gets hard to figure out just what kind of
  a larger point Blair is looking to make. Is Ruth a modern-day <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi_Driver\">Travis
  Bickle</a>, similarly angry at society but far less adept at resorting to violence?
  If so, her heart doesn’t really seem to be in it by the time the stakes get truly
  deadly.</p>\n\n<p><em>I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore</em> is most effective
  as a grumpy, shambolic comedy, a weird buddy picture for Lynskey and Wood that sees
  the former’s character dabbling in brutish selfishness and the latter’s enjoying
  a rare chance at a normal human friendship. It’s less interesting as a gory slapstick
  thriller, but the ending is memorable and Blair’s skill at directing action is undeniable.
  Still, the film perhaps works best of all as an unexpected treatise on the state
  of American manners in 2017—and as a story in which the real villain is humans’
  collective lack of empathy.</p>\n"

summary: Macon Blair’s directorial debut, a big winner at this year’s Sundance Film
  Festival, swerves wildly between indie comedy and ultra-violence.
