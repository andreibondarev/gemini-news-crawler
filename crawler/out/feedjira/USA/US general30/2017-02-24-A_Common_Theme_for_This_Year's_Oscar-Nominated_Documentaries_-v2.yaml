  to a bright, sunny day on the Aegean Sea. It’s October 28, 2015, and for a moment
  the setting is beautiful: blue sky, blue water, horizon tilting in and out of view.
  Then you hear the screams. A gloved hand reaches out of frame and returns pulling
  a young boy to safety aboard a coast-guard boat. Then the captain spins around with
  a baby girl in his arms. “Put the camera down,” he says to the person behind the
  lens. “Take this.”</p>\n\n<p>Just over four miles from Turkey, the Greek island
  of Lesbos has been on the front lines of the global refugee crisis. Since January
  2014, <a href=\"http://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean\">more than 1.5
  million people</a> have crossed the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, with many fleeing
  the Syrian civil war, the rise of ISIS, and oppressive regimes and poverty in sub-Saharan
  Africa. Upwards of 12,000 have died or gone missing along the way, but many of those
  who’ve survived the short but treacherous journey have landed on Lesbos, which received
  <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-01-27/the-growing-refugee-toll-on-lesvos\">more
  than 500,000 migrants</a> in 2015 alone.</p>\n\n<p>Daphne Matziaraki’s 20-minute
  Oscar-nominated film <em>4.1 Miles</em> follows Greek Coast Guard Captain Kyriakos
  Papadopoulos as he and a small crew on Lesbos head out to sea again and again to
  pluck desperate men, women, and children from the swells. Before thousands of Syrians,
  Afghans, and Iraqis started setting out in boats in the hopes of finding refuge
  in Europe, Papadopoulos spent his days making routine patrols. But the film finds
  the captain thrust into the role of professional savior without any additional training
  or equipment—an average citizen trying to deal with a humanitarian disaster.</p>\n\n<aside
  class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"></aside>\n\n<p>Of the 10 films
  nominated for the 2017 Academy Awards in the documentary categories, four deal with
  the Syrian conflict or refugee crisis. Along with <em>4.1 Miles</em>, the Netflix
  original <em>The White Helmets </em>and <em>Watani: My Homeland </em>are up for
  the short-form documentary Oscar, while <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/fire-at-sea-documentary-review/517359/\">the
  Italian film <em>Fire at Sea</em></a> was nominated for best feature documentary.
  The strength of these projects lies in the emotional, and often stark, portraits
  they paint of their characters. If audiences can imagine themselves in the shoes
  of Syrian rescue workers, a Greek coast-guard captain, an overwhelmed physician,
  or a migrant mother, these films may do more than enlighten or inform. Their creators
  all told me they hoped that, like other documentaries that have mobilized viewers
  and influenced lawmakers, their films can make far-away problems feel more immediately
  urgent.</p>\n\n<p>The films’ nominations were announced just four days after President
  Donald Trump’s inauguration and three days before <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/01/trump-immigration-order-muslims/514844/\">he
  issued an executive order</a> suspending refugee admissions from Syria indefinitely
  and from all other countries for 120 days. The order also temporarily halted arrivals
  from seven majority-Muslim nations and cut the total number of refugees that would
  be admitted to the U.S. in 2017 by more than half to 50,000. While the travel ban
  has since been <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/trump-ninth-circuit-defeat/517095/\">suspended
  by federal courts</a>, Trump’s executive order set off protests at airports across
  the country and pushed the people and issues portrayed in these documentaries back
  into the national spotlight.</p>\n\n<p>“When I made the film [in 2015], I thought
  it was very timely because it was when the refugee crisis was in the news,” Matziaraki
  told me. “I would never ever imagine that unfortunately the film would be so much
  more timely now in the U.S.”<strong> </strong>While it’s unusual to have so many
  Oscar nominees address the same topic, <em>The White Helmets </em>producer Joanna
  Natasegara told me it makes sense in this case: “Storytelling has always engaged
  with the most pressing issues of any given time, and documentary perhaps even more
  than narrative [film].” Those issues today, she said, are the refugee crisis and
  the war in Syria.</p>\n\n<p>As a medium, documentaries offer an intimacy and focus
  often missing in daily news. Since the Syrian conflict began in 2011, the escalating
  violence and resulting flood of migrants have been covered by the international
  press, but in the face of constant coverage, it’s difficult for many readers to
  sustain the same level of attention day to day. It often takes a particularly horrifying
  image—a dead toddler washed up on a beach, a blank-faced 5-year-old covered in blood
  and dust—to re-galvanize interest.</p>\n\n<p>Matziaraki, who grew up in Greece but
  is now based in the San Francisco Bay Area, said even she felt disconnected from
  the disaster playing out in her homeland. When she arrived on Lesbos, she found
  the situation was worse than she’d imagined. “I really wanted to make a film that
  would [bridge] this gap between our comfort zone and the reality of the world,”
  she said.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\">“I asked them, ‘Why
  go across the sea if you might die?’ They said, ‘It’s the word “might” that makes
  us go across the sea. The word “might” is hope.’”</aside>\n\n<p><em>The</em> <em>White
  Helmets </em>director Orlando von Einsiedel also admitted to feeling numb to the
  tragedy. The film, made with Natasegara, tells the story of the Syrian Civil Defense,
  a group of volunteer rescue workers in the country who respond to attacks on civilians.
  When the filmmakers saw a YouTube video of the White Helmets pulling a newborn from
  a bombed-out building, they recognized a story missing from the mainstream representation
  of Syria. “There’s a confusing, unbalanced picture of what is left behind for Syrian
  civilians on the ground, and a vacuum of any narrative about Syrians helping themselves
  or being active in their own saving,” Natasegara told me. “The idea of the Syrian
  hero was almost completely absent from the media landscape.” The White Helmets were
  the “perfect anecdote” to that gap: They were former bakers, builders, tailors,
  and students who’d banded together to save their fellow Syrians.</p>\n\n<p>The other
  Syria-specific film, <em>Watani: My Homeland </em>follows the family of a rebel
  commander in Aleppo who has been kidnapped by ISIS. His wife, Hala, and their four
  children make the heartbreaking decision to flee the country and begin a new life
  in Germany. The director Marcel Mettelsiefen, a veteran photojournalist who covered
  the Arab Spring, said documentaries offer an emotional way into a story that can
  otherwise feel abstract. “The importance of documentary filmmaking is to humanize
  the conflict,” he told me.</p>\n\n<p>In the feature category, Gianfranco Rosi’s
  <em>Fire at Sea </em>focuses on Lampedusa, an Italian island where hundreds of thousands
  of African refugees have landed since the 1990s. The filmmaker moved to Lampedusa
  for a year and a half to understand both the rhythms of daily life and the harrowing
  journey migrants endure to get there. “The film is a cry of help to raise awareness,”
  Rosi told me, recounting a conversation with one migrant. “When I asked them, ‘Why
  go across the sea if you might die?’ They said, ‘It’s the word “might” that makes
  us go across the sea. The word “might” is hope.’”</p>\n\n<p>While documentaries
  may have once been considered stale educational fare, their reputation as an exciting
  and mainstream art form <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2013/04/edelstein-documentary-is-better-than-filmmaking.html\">has
  undoubtedly grown in recent years</a>. Because of new distribution options and social
  media, documentaries now have the potential to reach a more global audience. By
  licensing <em>The White Helmets</em> to video-streaming giant Netflix, von Einsiedel
  and Natasegara made their film available in 190 countries (fellow documentary Oscar
  nominee <em>13th</em> is also on Netflix). Matziaraki’s <em>4.1 Miles—</em>produced
  while she was a graduate student in journalism at the University of California-Berkeley—<a
  href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000004674545/41-miles.html\">can
  be viewed</a> on the <em>New York Times</em>’ website, free to anyone with an internet
  connection. <em>Fire at Sea </em>has been released in 64 countries, including Japan,
  where it opened earlier this month. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-asylum-idUSKBN15O0UV?il=0\">According
  to <em>Reuters</em></a>, the country accepted only 28 refugees in 2016, yet the
  10 p.m. showing sold out in Tokyo on opening night.</p>\n\n<p>Documentaries can
  often have clear, measurable consequences—whether driving politicians to action
  or investing the general public in an issue that affects them. A <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0003122415598534\">2015
  study</a> found that <em>Gasland</em>, the 2010 documentary on the dangers of fracking,
  led to greater discussion on social media and increased mass-media coverage, after
  its release and subsequent nomination for an Oscar in 2011. Sometimes films are
  credited with inspiring legislation—as was the case with the 2012 Oscar-nominated
  film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invisible_War#Response\"><em>The
  Invisible War</em></a>, which investigated sexual assault in the military, and the
  2013 documentary <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackfish_(film)#Impact\"><em>Blackfish</em></a>,
  which explored the treatment of orca whales at SeaWorld. Of course, some films have
  been criticized for misleading audiences by omitting inconvenient details or twisting
  statistics to make a more convincing argument or interesting story (as was the <a
  href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2010/11/11/myth-charter-schools/\">accusation
  leveled</a> at the 2010 documentary <em>Waiting for “Superman</em>,” which portrayed
  charter schools as the prescription for an ailing public education system.)</p>\n\n<p>While
  it’s too soon to tell if this year’s Oscar-nominated documentaries have had a broader
  effect on people’s understanding of the migrant crisis or Syrian conflict, some
  of the filmmakers have already seen their work resonate on a smaller scale. Matziaraki
  said she’s received letters from viewers asking how they can help or donate, including
  from one who traveled to Lesbos to volunteer after seeing<em> 4.1 Miles</em>. “People
  that write to me and say, ‘Thank you for changing my mind. Thank you for making
  me realize what is happening.’ This is really maybe the most important thing,” Matziaraki
  said.</p>\n\n<p>In the <em>Fire at Sea</em> director Rosi’s experience, the emotional
  connection fostered by these documentaries inevitably leads to a question: “What
  can I do?” Over the phone from New York, one of Rosi’s film subjects, Pietro Bartolo,
  offered one answer. As the physician on Lampedusa, Bartolo is often the first person
  to have real human contact with the refugees who arrive; he’s also the man who performs
  autopsies on those who don’t make it alive. He told me it’s important to simply
  show migrants they are welcome. “People say, ‘Can I come to Lampedusa to help?’
  We don’t need the help. We never asked for any help,” he said. “On Lampedusa, we
  are the door. That we leave it open, this is not enough. [When the refugees] arrive
  in Europe they need to feel that they are home.”</p>\n"
