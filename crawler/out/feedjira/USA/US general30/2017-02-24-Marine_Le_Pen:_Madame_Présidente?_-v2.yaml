  Le Pen is hoping the wave of populism sweeping the Western world carries her to
  the Élysée Palace.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“The wind of history has turned,” Le Pen,
  who heads the far-right National Front (FN), <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHPOW91K-fM\">told</a>
  a crowd of supporters at the kickoff of her presidential bid earlier this month
  in Lyon, the industrial city in southeastern France. “It will carry us to the summit.”</p>\n\n<p
  dir=\"ltr\">Opinion polls have shown Le Pen winning the first round of France’s
  presidential election in April, only to lose to whomever she faces in the second
  round of voting in May. That candidate will likely be <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/11/francois-fillon-france/508607/\">François
  Fillon</a>, the center-right candidate, or <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir1_nk_aPSAhUFj1QKHcLnCocQFggaMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fnews%2Farchive%2F2017%2F02%2Fmacron-economics%2F515919%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNH2xaKOZJsUIoPfpTzqFN_AfzC6og&amp;sig2=fUSJncYjv0HPXoPFDu6Ewg&amp;bvm=bv.147448319,d.eWE\">Emmanuel
  Macron</a>, the independent; polls show the two men seesawing between second and
  third place in the first round. If no candidate achieves a majority in the first
  round, the top-two vote getters advance to a second round run-off. Although it’s
  still early, and polling can be wrong, the likelihood of Le Pen beating either Fillon
  or Macron in the second round is slim. Still, with the Western establishment reeling
  from Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election, the U.K.’s decision
  to leave the European Union, and growing anger at political elites throughout Europe,
  Le Pen and other far-right, populist leaders in Europe fancy their chances.</p>\n\n<p
  dir=\"ltr\">Le Pen envisions a France with closed borders, its own currency, and
  tough immigration controls; a country that is independent of international bodies
  like NATO, and one that ultimately puts itself first. This inward thinking, Le Pen
  reminded supporters, would not be unique to France.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“Other
  people have shown the way,” she said, alluding to the Brexit vote last summer and
  Trump’s election last November.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although such sentiments might
  be experiencing a resurgence, many of Le Pen’s policies are not new. Indeed, her
  <a href=\"https://www.marine2017.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/projet-presidentiel-marine-le-pen.pdf\">144-point
  manifesto</a> outlining her vision for France reflects many of the policies the
  FN has put forward since it was founded more than four decades ago by her father,
  Jean-Marie Le Pen. From the onset, the party has opposed the European Union, economic
  protectionism, and same-sex marriage. It has also been characterized by anti-immigrant,
  anti-Muslim, and anti-Semitic sentiment (Jean-Marie Le Pen has repeatedly dismissed
  the Holocaust as a minor “<a href=\"http://www.bfmtv.com/politique/jean-marie-le-pen-persiste-sur-les-chambres-a-gaz-873716.html\">detail</a>”
  of history and defended collaborators of the Vichy government, which deported tens
  of thousands of French Jews to death camps during World War II).</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Those
  views haven’t earned the FN much electoral success. The party <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/12/marine-le-pen-front-national-france/420348/\">didn’t
  win</a> a single local election in 2015, and claims only two<strong> </strong>seats
  in French parliament. The FN’s previous best performance in the presidential election
  was in 2002 when Jean-Marie Le Pen advanced to the second round for the first time
  in the FN’s history; voters handed then-incumbent President Jacques Chirac 82 percent
  of the vote—an unprecedented victory that was widely regarded more<strong> </strong>as
  a rebuke of the FN than approval of Chirac. By the time Marine Le Pen took over
  as the leader of the FN in 2011, the party began a period of transformative rebranding—one
  which retained its far-right values with less emphasis on the homophobic, anti-Semitic
  elements. This ultimately resulted in the expulsion of the elder Le Pen from the
  party in 2015 in a family battle played out in the media.</p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\"

  on March 17, 2007. (Daniel Joubert / Reuters)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“Voluntarily
  or not, he gave ammunition to our adversaries,” Le Pen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/01/the-ruthlessly-effective-rebranding-of-europes-new-far-right\">said</a>
  of her father in November, adding: “Today our adversaries no longer have that ammunition.”</p>\n\n<p
  dir=\"ltr\">Still, the younger Le Pen’s rebranding efforts alone may not be enough.
  Dr. David Lees, a researcher on French politics at Warwick University, told me last
  November<strong> </strong>that though Le Pen’s outsider status has certainly helped
  her anti-establishment image, it could also pose a challenge.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b>“</b>The
  FN has only got two members of the National Assembly in France … so if she does
  win, she wouldn’t be able to form a government,” Lees said. “She would find it very
  hard to govern without having any sense of support in Parliament. She just wouldn’t
  get anything through because the options of ruling by decree in France are very
  small for a president.”</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Indeed, finding common ground with
  other members of the government would prove difficult for Le Pen—especially in comparison
  to competitors like Macron, whose centrist, business-orientated agenda could be
  more appealing to swing votes on the left and right than the FN’s populist agenda.
  Still, Le Pen’s rebranding has proven effective in communities previously marginalized
  by the FN. The party has actively pursued more progressive causes such as promoting
  women’s rights and gay rights, as well as protecting France’s Jewish community from
  anti-Semitism—often by presenting Muslim immigration as a threat to all three.</p>\n\n<p
  dir=\"ltr\">“We do not want to live under the rule or threat of Islamic fundamentalism,”
  she told supporters in Lyon, and accused Muslim immigrants of “looking to impose
  on us gender discrimination in public places, full body veils or not, prayer rooms
  in the workplace, prayers in the streets, huge mosques.”</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The
  FN has found common cause with far-right parties throughout Europe who share its
  anti-Islam and anti-globalist agenda, as well as other governments. Le Pen has praised
  both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-le-pen-idUSKBN13B230\">noting</a>
  that if she were elected, the three leaders “would be good for world peace.” Le
  Pen has been a vocal proponent of rapprochement with Russia. In addition to rejecting
  the notion of Russia’s actions in Ukraine’s Crimea as an invasion, she also condemned
  U.S. and EU sanctions on Moscow as “<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2017/02/01/france-intv-amanpour-marine-le-pen-b.cnn\">completely
  stupid</a>.” The FN received an 11-million euro (about $11.6 million) loan from
  the Moscow-based First Czech Russian Bank in 2014, and Le Pen has <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/le-pen-russia-crimea-putin-money-bank-national-front-seeks-russian-cash-for-election-fight/\">reportedly</a>
  asked Russia for another loan to finance her current presidential bid, citing French
  banks’ refusal to lend.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fredrik Wesslau, the director of the
  Wider Europe Programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told me in
  January that<strong> </strong>Moscow’s ideological affinity with the FN is what
  attracts it to most of Europe’s far-right populist parties.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“They
  see a country that’s willing to stick up for socially conservative rights, that’s
  embraced authoritarian populism, that’s also xenophobic, in particular anti-Islam,
  which is something that many of these parties can relate to,” Wesslau said. “There’s
  a lot of overlap.”</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And while the FN leader isn’t the only
  French presidential candidate to support better relations with Russia (Fillon, the
  center-right candidate, has also supported reconciliation), reports of Russian media
  coverage favoring Le Pen against other contenders has sparked <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/19/opinion/russian-meddling-and-europes-elections.html\">concerns</a>
  Moscow might try to interfere in France’s elections similar to the way it did in
  the U.S. elections.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But for all the challenges Le Pen faces
  as an untested leader of historically fringe party, one that is often overlooked
  is her role as France’s sole female candidate. Women have historically been underrepresented
  in French politics, with female lawmakers making up <a href=\"http://www.ipu.org/wmn-f/classif.htm\">25
  percent</a> of the National Assembly and <a href=\"http://www.ipu.org/wmn-f/classif.htm\">27
  percent</a> of the Senate. Édith Cresson became the first and only woman to serve
  as prime minister in 1991 under President François Mitterrand, but suffered low
  approval ratings and lost the post after less than a year—a loss some attribute
  to <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=4wQe6IcBaMQC&amp;pg=PA189#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">misogynist
  attitudes</a> among the Socialist party elites. Socialist party member Ségolène
  Royal made French history in 2007 when she became the first woman to be nominated
  as a presidential candidate by a major party. She lost to Nicolas Sarkozy in the
  second round.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If Le Pen advances to the second round as polls
  suggest she could, she’ll only be the second female candidate to have done so since
  Royal. It’s a glass ceiling Lees said she may have a difficult time shattering.</p>\n\n<p
  dir=\"ltr\">“We’ve never had a female president, we’ve never had a female leader
  really in France,” Lees said. “So there really isn’t precedent there.”</p>\n\n<p
  dir=\"ltr\">With the first round of voting less than two months away, Le Pen has
  the task of maintaining the lead polls have given her since the start of the election.
  But it will also involve not being derailed by recent <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/liveblogs/2017/01/europe-elections/513677/14799/\">allegations</a>
  she misused 300,000 euros of EU funds to pay her parliamentary assistants. It’s
  a charge Le Pen denies, and one that has resulted in the arrest of her chief of
  staff, Catherine Griset, who has been <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/liveblogs/2017/01/europe-elections/513677/14799/\">charged
  with breach of trust</a>. Le Pen’s lawyers say the investigation is an attempt to
  harm the presidential hopeful “at the very moment when her candidacy is making a
  major breakthrough.”</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n"
