  \       \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n</figure>\n\n<p>Last year, the comedian Marc Maron
  brought the author Chuck Klosterman on as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHfg1mnZN3Y\">a
  guest on his <em>WTF</em> podcast</a>. The two <a href=\"http://screencrush.com/2016-the-year-of-surprise-10-cloverfield-lane-lemonade/\">discussed
  many things</a> (including Klosterman’s then-new book, <i>But What If We’re Wrong?</i>,
  which he was there to promote), but one of them was sports—and the particular thrill
  that they offer to audiences. Sporting events, Klosterman argued, promise that most
  dramatic of things: an unknown outcome. Unlike other widely watched events—the Super
  Bowl halftime show, the Grammys, the Oscars—the primary selling point of sporting
  events is that their endings are, by definition, unpredictable. Within them, anything
  can happen.</p>\n\n<p>Well. While you can say a lot about the Oscars on Sunday,
  you can’t say that the glitzy awards show was boringly predictable. The 89th Annual
  Academy Awards ceremony, right at its conclusion, brought a mixture of confusion
  and shock and full, deep delight to its viewers as Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway
  teamed up to announce the Best Picture winner and proceeded to, because of a backstage
  flub, announce the wrong movie. Chaos—and really, really good TV—ensued. Tired East
  Coasters were summoned back to their living rooms from their bedrooms, on the grounds
  that “ohmyGodyou’veGOTtoseethis.” Twitter erupted with jokes—about Bonnie and Clyde
  being at it again, about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/burritojustice/status/836086396792156161\">Schrödinger’s
  envelope</a>, about “Dewey Defeats Truman” getting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_MightyMarc_/status/836088378030379008\">an
  Oscars-friendly update</a>. It was late on a Sunday evening, and the unexpected
  had happened in the most unexpected of ways, and the whole thing was, as my colleague
  Adam Serwer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamSerwer/status/836081965778546689\">perfectly
  summed it up</a>, <i>Moon-lit</i>.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\">During
  a time when Google has made so much information attainable, knowingness has become
  a default presence in American cultural life.</aside>\n\n<p>The whole thing was
  also, however, a reminder of how rare it has become for audiences to witness, collectively,
  something that is truly Unexpected. This was live TV, with all the potential human
  error that live TV can bring—chaos, correction, drama, grace—at its depths but also
  its heights. What happened on Sunday hewed to roughly the same mechanics that gave
  the world all those <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/02/consider-the-left-shark/385258/\">Left
  Shark memes</a>, and those “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/nevertheless-she-persisted-and-the-age-of-the-weaponized-meme/516012/\">Nevertheless,
  She Persisted</a>” tattoos, and the term “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/01/the-legacy-of-janet-jacksons-boob/283499/\">wardrobe
  malfunction</a>”: The Oscars evoked caring by way of surprise. The Best Picture
  flub has become infamous overnight<strong> </strong>for roughly the same reason
  its predecessors did: It is exceedingly rare, in the highly produced world of mass
  media, for expectations to be thwarted.</p>\n\n<p>We know so much, nowadays. We
  are, in fact, <i>sure</i> of so much—about politics and human psychology and Hollywood
  awards shows and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/07/i-made-the-pea-guac/397565/\">the
  correct ingredients of guacamole</a>. During a time when Google has made so much
  information instantly attainable, knowingness has become a default presence in American
  cultural life. <em>Oooh, that show is supposed to be excellent. That movie is supposed
  to be terrible</em>. <em>Poke bowls are the thing now</em>. Big cultural events,
  the stuff of the Grammys and the Emmys and the Oscars, are in many ways the culmination
  of that posture: We know precisely what to expect of them. We can report, as they
  play out, that everything went according to plan, because we knew from the beginning
  what they were supposed to be; we can do that reporting, as well, with a note of
  disappointment. There are few things duller, after all, than met expectations.</p>\n\n<aside
  class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\">There are few things duller than met expectations.</aside>\n\n<p>In
  that context, the Beatty-Dunaway-Oscars flub was a gift to audiences (and perhaps
  to ABC’s future live-audience ratings). It was also Chuck Klosterman’s point to
  Maron, at once proven and proven wrong. Here was the anything-can-happen logic of
  the live sporting event, applied to Hollywood’s highest, most ceremonialized, and
  most expectation-driven, of rituals. That was a powerful thing: During a moment
  in the United States that so often takes for granted that “reality” is something
  that can be produced as well as experienced, the Best Picture Oscars flub was a
  powerful reminder that reality, still, has its own production values.</p>\n\n<p>Yes,
  the flub was many other things, too: a shame for <i>Moonlight</i>, which so richly
  deserved to win Best Picture and whose victory threatens to be overshadowed by the
  mistake and its ensuing dramas. A shame for <i>La La Land</i>, whose producers delivered
  their full acceptance speeches before learning that their “win” had been announced
  in error. A field day for photographers both professional and non-, who snapped
  reaction shots onstage and backstage and among the celebrity audience. A moment
  of grace, as <i>La La Land</i>’s producer, Jordan Horowitz, met Jimmy Kimmel’s cheeky
  suggestion that everyone should get an Oscar with a politely defiant “I’m going
  to be really thrilled to hand this to my friends from <i>Moonlight.</i>” And also,
  sure: a metaphor for the slings and arrows of the 2016 election. A ratification
  of pop culture's <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/01/the-oa-stranger-things-westworld-metaphysical-moment-alternative-realities-tv/511808/\">current
  obsession</a> with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MNightShyamalan/status/836084032798670848\">alternate
  realities</a>. A vehicle for many, many jokes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=steve%20harvey%20oscars&amp;src=tyah\">at
  the expense of Steve Harvey</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Mostly, though, it was a twist ending
  that arrived, by the looks of things, in the twistiest of ways: a shock that came
  not at the hands of a savvy producer, but at the hands of quirky reality. Twist
  endings may have been a defining feature of the events of 2016 and early 2017—the
  reality show that was the 2016 presidential campaign found its pundit-ratified frontrunner
  vanquished in the final episode; the 2016 World Series featured another victorious
  underdog; Super Bowl LI found the expected winners winning, but only after its game
  went into nail-biting overtime. Their twists, however, took place within events
  whose endings were, by definition, unknown. The Oscars was a ceremony, shockingly
  interrupted. It was expectation, compellingly thwarted.</p>\n\n<p>And so: It was
  powerful in a way that few things can be, anymore, in a world that knows so much
  and expects, in the end, so little. In <a href=\"http://screencrush.com/2016-the-year-of-surprise-10-cloverfield-lane-lemonade/\">an
  essay</a> for <i>Screen Crush</i> last year, Erin Whitney argued that “ours is a
  culture built on anticipation, where movies end with scenes teasing the next installment
  in the franchise, never allowing a moment’s rest to absorb what we just saw. We
  talk about movies years before they debut, we <a href=\"http://screencrush.com/tv-character-deaths-jon-snow-glenn-kevin-garvey/\">analyze
  TV plot twists</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.fuse.tv/2016/03/frank-ocean-new-album-guide-info\">anticipate
  albums</a> for years before hearing a single song.” This whole process has led,
  Whitney argued, to “the slow death of surprise.”</p>\n\n<p>The best evidence for
  that may be the fact that marketers have recently been focused on surprising consumers—capitalism
  doing its best to keep that particular kind of magic alive. The <a href=\"http://www.beyonce.com/album/lemonade-visual-album/\">dropped
  album</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/louis-c-k-surprise-releases-new-series-horace-and-pete-with-steve-buscemi-20160130\">surprise
  TV show</a>. The <a href=\"http://pcmreviews.com/news/2016/01/j-j-abrams-drops-surprise-trailer-for-secret-bad-robot-movie-titled-10-cloverfield-lane/\">secretly
  produced trailer</a>. The live-aired, anything-could-happen <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/12/hairspray-live-nbc-review/509972/\">TV
  musical</a>. They are trying to capture <a href=\"http://screencrush.com/2016-the-year-of-surprise-10-cloverfield-lane-lemonade/\">what
  Klosterman was conveying to Maron</a> in that <em>WTF</em> interview: “Sports is
  a connection to authentic aliveness,” the author <a href=\"http://screencrush.com/2016-the-year-of-surprise-10-cloverfield-lane-lemonade/?trackback=tsmclip\">put
  it</a> to the comedian. “This is not something that anybody can control or script.
  It’s this unknown thing.” He added: “There’s something real interesting about ‘nobody
  knows,’ because you just don’t experience that anymore.”</p>\n\n<p>You don’t, until
  you do—until that mistake makes its way onto the glitziest and scriptiest of all
  of Hollywood’s stages. Sunday’s Best Picture flub is not only already iconic; it
  is also already the subject of conspiracy theories from a wide range of Oscar truthers
  who suggest that, among other things, the mistake was <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2017/02/27/oscars-conspiracy-theory-trumps-revenge-kimmel/\">the
  result of President Trump exacting revenge on Jimmy Kimmel</a>; or <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/02/27/was-the-oscars-best-picture-mix-up-a-jimmy-kimmel-prank-conspiracy-theories-begin/?utm_term=.c3087d74cd54\">a
  prank pulled by Kimmel himself</a>; or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/accesshollywood/status/836084974033915904\">the
  dark dealings of Leonardo DiCaprio</a>. They may have a point; it is unclear, for
  now, how the wrong card got into Warren Beatty’s hands. What they forget, though,
  is what Klosterman knows, and what all those delighted audiences, on Sunday, knew
  along with him: that the best conspirator is often people’s great capacity to make
  big, and dramatic, mistakes.</p>\n"

summary: In an era when audiences are so sure about so much, the mistake—simple, dramatic,
  human—can be a wonderful thing.
