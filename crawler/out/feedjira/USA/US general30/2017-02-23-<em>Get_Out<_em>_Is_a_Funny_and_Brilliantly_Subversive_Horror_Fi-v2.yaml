  \   \n\n\n    \n    \n\n</figure>\n\n<p>The opening scene of <em>Get Out</em> is
  a familiar horror-movie image—a stranger walking an unfamiliar street, in the dead
  of night, nervously looking over their shoulder at every rustle of sound. The setting
  is the suburbs, a frequent favorite of the slasher genre, only the victim is not
  a scantily clad teen girl, but an African American man, uneasily navigating what
  seems like hostile territory. A car pulls up alongside him, blasting the dirge-like
  old-fashioned ditty “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXmk8dbFv_o\">Run
  Rabbit Run</a>.” “Not today,” he mutters, turning around and walking in the opposite
  direction. But of course, his fate is already sealed.</p>\n\n<p><em>Get Out</em>
  was written and directed by Jordan Peele, one half of the legendary sketch-comedy
  duo behind <em>Key & Peele</em>. That show had a remarkable grasp on the visual
  hallmarks of the film genres it often mimicked, and its humor often lay in the preciseness
  of its parody. But <em>Get Out </em>is no mere pastiche. It’s an atmospheric, restrained,
  extremely effective work of horror with a clear point of view, a darkly hilarious
  movie that never trips over itself in search of a cheap laugh or scare. What might
  sound like a one-joke premise turns into something richly textured; what might seem
  like an easy metaphor is, in fact, anything but.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"callout-placeholder\"
  data-source=\"curated\"></aside>\n\n<p>Like so many horror films, <em>Get Out</em>
  is exploring the creepy menace of the suburbs. Usually, similar slasher movies exist
  to puncture the false veneer of safety that comes with a white picket fence, but
  in <em>Get Out</em>, the threatening vibe is present from minute one. Chris (Daniel
  Kaluuya) is about to meet the parents of his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams)
  for the first time and is nervous when he realizes she hasn’t told them that he’s
  black. After a long drive, their manse turns out to be exactly what you might imagine—giant,
  secluded, pristine, and filled with trinkets from trips around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Rose’s
  father Dean (Bradley Whitford) is a little too eager to call Chris “my man,” her
  mother Missy (Catherine Keener) is icy and standoffish, and her brother Jeremy (Caleb
  Landry Jones) is weirdly aggressive, but there’s nothing that unusual going on at
  first. Peele layers in a familiar awkwardness before slowly introducing elements
  of dread. The house’s maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and the groundskeeper Walter
  (Marcus Henderson), both black, have strangely placid demeanors; Missy is a psychiatrist
  who keeps offering to hypnotize Chris (just to help him stop smoking, you understand);
  and, naturally, there’s a locked basement no one’s allowed to go into (just a nasty
  case of mold, of course).</p>\n\n<p>It’s best to know as little as possible about
  <em>Get Out</em>’s second and third acts. Peele’s plotting is as crisp as his knack
  for visual storytelling, and he doles out tidbits of information with glee, letting
  the audience slowly figure out the particulars of Rose’s family while they guess
  at just how deep the malevolence goes. Chris is on edge from minute one, understandably;
  behind the family’s friendly surface is the kind of passive prejudice he obviously
  feared from the get-go. The delight comes in watching how Peele heightens that into
  real terror. <em>Get Out</em> is clearly playing on the discomfort a young African
  American man might have in visiting a largely white community—something rarely explored
  by the horror genre.</p>\n\n<p>There are few more frightening monsters to conjure
  than racism, after all. It’s a topic the genre has brushed up against—with the black
  protagonist of <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>, a rare sight in 1968, or in Bernard
  Rose’s 1992 classic <em>Candyman</em>, in which the titular figure in part represented
  America’s history of slavery and repression. But racism is still a surprisingly
  uncommon subject matter, and Peele addresses a more insidious fear—of the fallacy
  of America being a post-racial society, and of the nightmares one can imagine under
  that benign surface.</p>\n\n<p>Kaluuya, a British actor who was extraordinary in
  the <em>Black Mirror </em>episode “Fifteen Million Merits” and, more recently, played
  Emily Blunt’s stoic partner in <em>Sicario</em>, is terrific in the lead role. Williams
  excels as Rose, weaponizing the lack of self-awareness she deploys so well on HBO’s
  <em>Girls</em>. The entire cast is perfectly restrained, save for maybe Jones, who
  feels unhinged from the start, and the delightful Lil Rel Howery, who plays Chris’s
  friend Rod, a TSA agent with the kind of moxie and deductive powers one might not
  expect from an employee of that particular agency.<strong> </strong>He’s a vehicle
  for the film’s biggest laugh lines—but <em>Get Out </em>is funny throughout, wringing
  jokes from even the tensest moments.</p>\n\n<p>Best of all, though, is that <em>Get
  Out </em>is truly frightening. Not because it’s loaded with jump scares (though
  it does have a couple of good ones), nor because it features excessively visceral
  violence. It’s so perfectly calibrated that every escalation feels organic: What
  begins as an awkward tale of meeting the parents becomes something much, much worse,
  but it’s all part of a fully realized whole. <em>Get Out </em>is an extremely confident
  debut feature for Peele, one steeped in the language of horror cinema rather than
  merely copying it. It’s also likely to be one of the wryest, funniest, most relevant
  films of the year.  </p>\n"
