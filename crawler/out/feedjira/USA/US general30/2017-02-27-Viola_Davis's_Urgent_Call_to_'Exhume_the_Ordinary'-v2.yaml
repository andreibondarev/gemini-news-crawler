  Davis’s acceptance speech for Best Supporting Actress began with a thanks to the
  Academy and this observation: “You know, there’s one place that all the people with
  the greatest potential are gathered.”</p>\n\n<p data-para-count=\"537\" data-total-count=\"1027\">Pause.
  Some viewers may have felt a queasy pang. Was the <em>Fences</em> actress about
  to give a sequel to Meryl Streep’s Golden Globes speech? Was the next line going
  to be “this room,” so as to stand up for the presidentially denounced entertainment
  industry, so as to preach for truth and inclusion, so as to spark another skirmish
  about whether Hollywood is too self-regarding?</p>\n\n<p data-para-count=\"537\"
  data-total-count=\"1027\">No. The next line: “One place, and that’s the graveyard.”</p>\n\n<p
  data-para-count=\"537\" data-total-count=\"1027\">Whew. Davis’s speech quickly went
  viral and received wide acclaim for a lot of reasons, and prime among them was simply
  good writing. She opened with a question and gave an answer few would have guessed.
  She exploited the power of surprise, a power <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/the-oscars-that-thing-that-happened-at-the-oscars-and-the-rare-power-of-shock/517917/\">demonstrated
  amply</a> elsewhere at the Oscars.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-video\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p

  data-para-count=\"537\" data-total-count=\"1027\">The speech also made self-evident
  why Davis deserves an Oscar. She seemed to be heaving with emotion, almost out of
  breath, and yet her words were clear and her sentences deftly paced. She gestured
  with the precision of her <em>How to Get Away With Murder</em> character Annalise
  Keating in law lecture, yet she showed the rawness of feeling that Mrs. Miller had
  in <em>Doubt</em>. But this was not acting. Or if it was, it was so good as<strong>
  </strong>to not seem like it. Which is, as Leonardo DiCaprio said from the stage
  elsewhere in the night, the definition of great acting.</p>\n\n<p data-para-count=\"537\"
  data-total-count=\"1027\">Most remarkable: the speech’s content. Typically, memorable
  Oscar acceptances make explicit political points, feature gaffes, or mark milestones.
  But Davis’s commanded attention through the mere discussion of art, as well as through
  specific, heartfelt shoutouts to colleagues and loved ones.</p>\n\n<p data-para-count=\"537\"
  data-total-count=\"1027\">“People ask me all the time: ‘What kind of stories do
  you want to tell, Viola?’” she said. “And I say, exhume those bodies, exhume those
  stories. The stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those dreams to
  fruition, people who fell in love and lost. I became an artist—and thank God I did—because
  we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life.”</p>\n\n<p
  data-para-count=\"537\" data-total-count=\"1027\">The resonance with Davis’s work
  was obvious: <em>Fences</em> is based on August Wilson’s play about a 1950s black
  working-class family whose members aren’t famous, who simply strive and spar against
  the backdrop of society and history. Wilson “exhumed and exalted the ordinary people,”
  Davis said; his story was “about people, and words, and life, and forgiveness, and
  grace.”</p>\n\n<p data-para-count=\"537\" data-total-count=\"1027\">But the resonance
  with other themes of the night, and the era, was also unmissable. The Best Picture
  nominees included many tales of the culturally invisible and frustrated: post-recession
  Texans bereft of opportunity in <em>Hell or High Water</em>, low-level NASA mathematicians
  mostly forgotten by history in <em>Hidden Figures</em>, orphans and destitute families
  in India in <em>Lion</em>. Most notably, Best Picture winner <em>Moonlight </em>unspooled
  the tale of a poor black gay man simply surviving, an ordinary life of the sort
  that is portrayed so infrequently as to seem extraordinary.</p>\n\n<p data-para-count=\"537\"
  data-total-count=\"1027\">So there is, in fact, politics here, though subtle. In
  the context of conversations about diversity and inclusion at the Oscars and in
  America more generally, Davis’s praise of stories about common people of thwarted
  dreams necessarily has a political meaning:<strong> </strong>Portraying previously
  unportrayed struggles means that lives other than white, straight, well-off, and/or
  male matter.</p>\n\n<p data-para-count=\"537\" data-total-count=\"1027\">The point
  was reinforced, lightly, as she thanked her sisters, remembering, “We were rich
  white women in the tea party games<em data-redactor-tag=\"em\" data-verified=\"redactor\">.”
  </em>They played as white and wealthy, perhaps, because that was what society had
  told them to fantasize about. Davis has shown the power of offering alternatives.</p>\n"
