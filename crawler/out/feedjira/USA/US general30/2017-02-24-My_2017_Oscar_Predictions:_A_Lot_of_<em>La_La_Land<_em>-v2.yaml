  \   \n\n\n    \n    \n\n</figure>\n\n<p>It’s that time of year again, when we can
  all grouse about the inanity of the Oscars: how the Academy ignores blockbusters
  or ignores indie films or ignores people of color. Only this time, there seems less
  to grouse about than usual. There are snubs here and there of course (cough, <em>Amy
  Adams</em>), and actors who through error or pretense find themselves in the wrong
  categories. But overall the Academy did a pretty credible job this time—credible
  enough that for this year I’m abandoning my customary categories of “who was nominated
  but shouldn’t have been” and “who wasn’t nominated but should have been.”</p>\n\n<p>But
  who is going to <em>win</em>? Before attempting to answer that question, I should
  disclose that I’ve gone 25 for 30 on my picks over the last three years (you can
  find them <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/02/my-2016-oscar-predictions/471027/\">here</a>,
  <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/02/my-2015-oscar-predictions/385655/\">here</a>,
  and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/02/my-2014-oscar-predictions/284125/\">here</a>),
  but I missed on Best Picture last year. (I thought <em>The Revenant </em>would beat
  <em>Spotlight</em>, and I was delighted to be wrong.) It is also perhaps worth noting
  that I was so spectacularly certain that <em>Avatar</em> would beat <em>The Hurt
  Locker</em> back in 2010 that I wrote an <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/73539/buy-me-love\">entire
  article</a> on the subject. (In that case, I was even happier to be wrong.) Also,
  as before, I’m only going through ten of the top categories, so if you need help
  with your picks for sound editing or live-action short, you’ll have to seek assistance
  elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>So keep all that in mind. As always, I obviously cannot condone
  any form of gambling, and will in no way consider it my fault if anyone happens
  to lose money based on my advice. Anyone who <em>makes </em>a little scratch, by
  contrast, and might be inclined to share it with their Oscar Whisperer, will find
  me easy enough to track down. Those curious about my own end-of-the-year awards,
  some of which are notably eccentric, can find them <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/12/the-best-movies-of-2016/511049/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<hr

  width=\"630\" />\n<figcaption class=\"credit\">A still from <em>La La Land </em>(Lionsgate
  / Summit)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p><strong>Best Picture</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Nominees:
  </strong><em>Arrival</em>, <em>Fences</em>, <em>Hacksaw Ridge</em>, <em>Hell or
  High Water</em>, <em>Hidden Figures</em>, <em>La La Land</em>, <em>Lion</em>, <em>Manchester
  by the Sea</em>, <em>Moonlight</em></p>\n\n<p>This has long been, and remains, <em>La
  La Land’s </em>race to lose. It’s become fashionable to lament that this is a bad
  thing and it would be better if <em>Moonlight</em> were to win instead. There are
  perhaps good arguments to be made on this score, but most of the arguments being
  made aren’t very good.</p>\n\n<p>It is without question a promising sign that <em>Moonlight</em>,
  a movie about the romance between two black men coming of age in inner-city Miami,
  directed by a black man, is not only a Best Picture nominee but a genuine contender
  to win. This is especially true given the Academy’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/oscarssowhite\">much-noted</a>
  shortcomings over the last couple of years.</p>\n\n<p>But the widespread critique
  that <em>La La Land</em> is “only” the frontrunner because it is about Hollywood’s
  love for itself dramatically shortchanges Damien Chazelle’s film, which is a tremendously
  ambitious undertaking on its own terms, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/12/la-la-land-review-damien-chazelle-ryan-gosling-emma-stone/510092/\">novel
  and nostalgic in equal measure</a>. This is not <em>The Artist</em>. Should <em>La
  La Land </em>come away with the statue, as I strongly suspect it will, it will mean
  nothing other than that it was a terrific film.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re looking for
  the upset, definitely go with <em>Moonlight</em>. If you’re looking for a really
  big upset, try <em>Manchester by the Sea</em> or <em>Hidden Figures</em>. If you
  want an upset even bigger than that, buy a lottery ticket.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What
  will win:</strong> <em>La La Land</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>What ought to win: </strong><em>Arrival</em></p>\n\n<hr

  width=\"630\" />\n<figcaption class=\"credit\">Damien Chazelle on the set of <em>La
  La Land </em>(Dale Robinette / Lionsgate / Summit)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p><strong>Best
  Director </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Damien Chazelle <em>(</em><em>La
  La Land</em><em>), </em>Mel Gibson<em> (</em><em>Hacksaw Ridge</em><em>), </em>Barry
  Jenkins<em> (</em><em>Moonlight</em><em>),</em> Kenneth Lonergan<em> (</em><em>Manchester
  by the Sea</em><em>)</em><em>, </em>Denis Villeneuve (<em>Arrival</em><em>)</em></p>\n\n<p>The
  big surprise here, of course, is that Mel Gibson was nominated, despite the facts
  that a) <em>Hacksaw Ridge</em> was good but not great; and b) not so long ago, Gibson
  had a very-well-earned reputation as a depraved maniac. But Hollywood can be forgiving,
  especially <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2017/01/mel-gibson-best-director-oscars.html\">if
  you have the right friends</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, Mel will not be repeating
  his <em>Braveheart</em> feat by taking home the actual statue. Here, again, the
  safe money is on Chazelle who, at 32, is already filling up his trophy case. For
  those who want to split their picture/director votes, Jenkins and Lonergan both
  have a shot here. Just not a very good one.</p>\n\n<p>Which seems like as good a
  time as any—and no, it won’t be the last—to express my unhappiness that <em>Arrival</em>,
  <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2017/01/mel-gibson-best-director-oscars.html\">the
  best film of the year</a>, is not really in the running for any of the major awards.
  My best explanation for this is that the film ultimately found itself betwixt and
  between: too big to be the kind of arty film that critics love to champion, but
  not big enough (its domestic box office was almost exactly $100 million) to force
  its way into the conversation, à la <em>Avatar</em>, in a “the people have spoken”
  fashion. Regardless, it’s terrific. Go see it if you haven’t already.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who
  will win: </strong>Damien Chazelle</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who ought to win: </strong>Denis
  Villeneuve</p>\n\n<hr />\n<figure><img alt=\"\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2017/02/LLL_D09_01624_R/273036bf2.jpg\"

  / Summit)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p><strong>Best Actress</strong></p>\n\n<p><b>Nominees:
  </b>Isabelle Huppert (<em>Elle</em><em>), </em>Ruth Negga (<em>Loving</em><em>)</em>,
  Natalie Portman (<em>Jackie</em><em>), </em>Emma Stone<em> </em><em>(</em><em>La
  La Land</em><em>)</em>, Meryl Streep (<em>Florence Foster Jenkins</em><em>)</em></p>\n\n<p>This
  is an unusually strong category this year, and would be stronger still if Academy
  voters hadn’t briefly lost their minds and forgotten to nominate Amy Adams, who
  gave one of the year’s truly indelible performances in <i>Arrival</i>. Shame on
  you, Academy voters.</p>\n\n<p>Emma Stone is the favorite here, and she’s a perfectly
  solid pick—even if I’d prefer Negga or Huppert. The strongest challenger is probably
  Portman, which would be extremely dispiriting. <i>Jackie</i> was not a good movie,
  nor was hers a particularly good performance. When it comes to portrayals of well-known
  figures from the 20th century, there are two ways an actor can go: pure mimesis
  (the accent, the mannerisms, maybe a little prosthetic enhancement) or actually
  digging beneath the surface to find the real person underneath the fame. The examples
  I typically think of are Cate Blanchett’s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2005/05/the-movie-review-the-aviator/69440/\">grating,
  empty portrait</a> of Katherine Hepburn in <i>The Aviator</i> (for the former category)
  and Christopher Plummer’s deft and nuanced work as Mike Wallace in <i>The Insider</i>
  (for the latter).</p>\n\n<p>Portman’s portrait of Jackie Kennedy falls firmly into
  the former set. Still, if you want to bet against Stone, this is probably the way
  to go. There’s a reason Blanchett won for <i>The Aviator</i> and Plummer wasn’t
  even nominated for <i>The Insider</i>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who will win: </strong>Emma
  Stone</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who ought to win: </strong>Amy Adams (had she been nominated<strong>);</strong><strong>

  width=\"630\" />\n<figcaption class=\"credit\">Casey Affleck in <em>Manchester by
  the Sea</em> (Amazon Studios)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p><strong>Best Actor</strong></p>\n\n<p><b>Nominees:
  </b>Casey Affleck (<em>Manchester by the Sea</em><em>), </em>Andrew Garfield (<em>Hacksaw
  Ridge</em><em>), </em>Ryan Gosling (<em>La La Land</em><em>), </em>Viggo Mortensen
  (<em>Captain Fantastic</em><em>)</em>, Denzel Washington (<em>Fences</em><em>)</em></p>\n\n<p>What
  was that I was saying about how Hollywood can be forgiving if you have the right
  friends? Well this is particularly true if those friends are Matt Damon and your
  big brother Ben Affleck. One can debate the ways in which <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/01/why-the-allegations-against-casey-affleck-should-stand-alone/512234/\">the
  cases of Nate Parker and Casey Affleck are similar and are different</a>, but the
  former’s early Oscar hopes vanished entirely and the latter’s appear to be chugging
  along unimpeded.</p>\n\n<p>It helps Affleck considerably that his performance was
  genuinely remarkable and his competition is relatively weak, especially given the
  customary strength of the category. Denzel Washington has the best chance of pulling
  off an upset here—and it’s a pretty decent one. He’s hampered a bit by the fact
  that <em>Fences</em> (which Washington directed himself) has very much a “filmed
  play” quality to it, as does his notably theatrical performance. Gosling may have
  a (very) outside shot here, too. But if you’re looking for an upset in the major
  categories—or you just don’t feel good about picking Affleck—Washington is probably
  the way to go.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who will win: </strong>Casey Affleck</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who

  Supporting Actress</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Viola Davis <em>(</em><em>Fences</em><em>),</em>
  Naomie Harris (<em>Moonlight</em><em>),</em> Nicole Kidman (<em>Lion</em>), Octavia
  Spencer (<em>Hidden Figures</em>), Michelle Williams (<em>Manchester by the Sea</em>)</p>\n\n<p>Every
  year, there is at least one performer who competes a weight class lower than he
  or she should in order to get a win. Last year, Rooney Mara and Alicia Vikander
  both submitted what were really lead performances, but were both nominated for supporting
  actress—a category that Vikander wound up winning.</p>\n\n<p>Viola Davis is no dummy.
  She’s been nominated for Oscars twice before without winning (for <em>Doubt </em>and
  <em>The Help</em>), and she wants to take home that statue. Which, as it happens,
  she is overwhelmingly likely to do. I said it last year and I’ll say it again. The
  Academy has to take firmer control of its own nominating process if we don’t want
  to see category fraud like this every season. Davis is a great actress, and was
  the best thing in <em>Fences</em>. But she should be competing—and perhaps winning—against
  Stone, Portman, Negga, and Huppert.</p>\n\n<p>If you must bet against Davis, Naomie
  Harris and Michelle Williams have about equal chances of pulling off an upset—which
  is to say, very little chance at all.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who will win: </strong>Viola

  width=\"630\" />\n<figcaption class=\"credit\">Mahershala Ali (left) in <em>Moonlight</em>
  (A24)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p><strong>Best Supporting Actor</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Nominees:
  </strong>Mahershala Ali <em>(</em><em>Moonlight</em><em>), </em>Jeff Bridges (<em>Hell
  or High Water</em>), Lucas Hedges (<em>Manchester by the Sea</em><em>),</em> Dev
  Patel (<em>Lion</em><em>), </em>Michael Shannon (<em>Nocturnal Animals</em>)</p>\n\n<p>Well,
  at least the Academy realized that if it was going to nominate a performance in
  <em>Nocturnal Animals</em> it should be Michael Shannon’s slightly creepy lawman
  and not Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s totally forgettable outlaw. The fact that the latter
  was nominated—<em>and won!</em>—at the Golden Globes is yet further evidence (as
  if any were needed in this age) that voters are capable of doing strange and awful
  things.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s assume that the universe has righted itself sufficiently
  to correct at least this injustice, by giving Mahershala Ali the award he so very
  clearly deserves. His work in <em>Moonlight </em>was nothing short of stunning.</p>\n\n<p>Jeff
  Bridges is no doubt just happy to be nominated for his <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/08/hell-or-high-water-is-an-iconic-tale-of-the-modern-west/495551/\">outstanding
  work</a> in <em>Hell or High Water</em>. But if you’re looking for someone to upset
  Ali, Dev Patel may have a very small shot. Or who knows? Maybe Aaron Taylor-Johnson
  can win again, this time by write-in vote. My capacity for astonishment has been
  pretty much exhausted of late.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who will win:</strong> Mahershala

  </strong><em>Hell or High Water, La La Land, The Lobster, Manchester by the Sea,
  20th Century Women</em></p>\n\n<p>It’s awfully nice to see <em>The Lobster</em>,
  Yorgos Lanthimos’s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/the-lobster-a-dystopian-tour-de-force/482619/\">dystopian
  tour de force</a>, get some attention here, though if it somehow manages an out-of-nowhere
  victory, I’ll eat … a lobster? That actually doesn’t sound so bad.</p>\n\n<p>It’s
  also nice to see what could be a genuinely close race here, between <em>La La Land</em>
  and <em>Manchester by the Sea</em>. There are a number of ways of looking at this
  one. Will voters go with director Lonergan’s screenplay as an alternative to voting
  for Affleck as best actor? Or will any Affleck-related drag be able to sink the
  movie in a close race (like this one) but not in a possible blowout in the acting
  category? Will <em>La La Land</em> benefit, sweep-like, from its many awards? Or
  could Chazelle fatigue set in?</p>\n\n<p>This is the category in which I am least
  confident of all, but I’m going with <em>Manchester by the Sea</em> by a nose.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What

  is the category in which <em>Moonlight</em>—which is adapted from Tarell Alvin McCraney’s
  play <em>In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue</em>—is most likely to come away a winner.
  <em>Arrival </em>once looked like it had a solid shot here, like its fellow “thinking

  </strong>Greig Fraser (<em>Lion</em>), James Laxton (<em>Moonlight</em>), Rodrigo
  Prieto (<em>Silence</em>), Linus Sandgren (<em>La La Land</em>), Bradford Young
  (<em>Arrival</em>)</p>\n\n<p>So what do we know about the cinematography award?
  We know that, because he is not nominated, Emmanuel Lubezki is probably not going
  to win for a fourth year in a row (following <em>Gravity</em>, <em>Birdman</em>,
  and <em>The Revenant</em>). And, nothing against Lubezki, but that’s probably a
  good thing. We also know that Roger Deakins, who has been nominated an incredible
  13 times without ever winning, isn’t going to win—because he’s not nominated either.
  Nor is (three-time winner, nine-time nominee) Robert Richardson. Keeping track of
  the award this year is a little like watching the NBA Finals with LeBron James,
  Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving, Draymond Green, and Kevin Love all sitting
  out hurt.</p>\n\n<p>Bradford Young is the first African-American cinematographer
  ever nominated for the award, which is shocking, and he’d be my pick in a heartbeat
  for his magnificent work on (you guessed it) <em>Arrival.</em> (He also shot my
  two favorite films of 2014, <em>Selma </em>and <em><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/01/a-most-violent-year-is-a-most-extraordinary-film/384392/\">A
  Most Violent Year</a></em>.) But here, again, <em>Arrival </em>doesn’t seem likely
  to get much love.The safest bet, as so often this year, is probably on <em>La La
  Land </em>and its cinematographer Linus Sandgren. If you want to look elsewhere,
  <em>Lion</em> probably has the best shot at an upset. Or partisans of <em>Moonlight</em>
  and <em>Arrival</em> can just cross their fingers and take their chances.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who

  is the way Pixar and Disney Animation—which are both owned by the same company and
  run by the same executives—have essentially switched places. (I’ll be writing more
  about this soon.) Disney scored two nominations in the Animated Feature category
  this year, with <em>Zootopia</em> and <em>Moana</em>. Pixar, meanwhile, couldn’t
  manage a nod for <em>Finding Dory</em>, despite the fact that it was the second-highest
  grossing movie of the year behind <em>Rogue One</em>. Go figure.</p>\n\n<p>It was
  actually a banner year for animated movies, especially if you managed to avoid the
  truly awful <em>Sing. The Red Turtle</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/01/the-elegant-simplicity-of-the-red-turtle/514190/\">gorgeous,
