url: https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/opinions/jim-jordan-clarence-thomas-judiciary-committee-obeidallah/index.html
summary: 'On Monday, the GOP-controlled House Judiciary Committee — chaired by Donald
  Trump ally Rep. Jim Jordan — is set to hold a field hearing in New York City called
  "Victims of Violent Crime in Manhattan." A statement bills the hearing as an examination
  of how, the Judiciary Committee says, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg''s
  policies have "led to an increase in violent crime and a dangerous community for
  New York City residents." '
