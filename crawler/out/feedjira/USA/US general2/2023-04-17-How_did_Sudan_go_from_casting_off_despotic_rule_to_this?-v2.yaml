url: https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/opinions/sudan-revolution-to-civil-war-lynch/index.html
summary: Four years ago, almost to the day, the people of Sudan were celebrating a
  revolution after overthrowing longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir. Now the East African
  country faces the possibility of a complete collapse similar to the chaos we see
  today in Yemen or Libya.
