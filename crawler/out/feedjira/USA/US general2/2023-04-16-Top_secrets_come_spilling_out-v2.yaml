summary: 'In 1917, British analysts deciphered a coded message the German foreign
  minister sent to one of his country''s diplomats vowing to begin "unrestricted submarine
  warfare" and seeking to win over Mexico with a promise to "reconquer the lost territory
  in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona" if the US entered the world war. When it became
  public, the Zimmerman Telegram caused a sensation, helping propel the US into the
  conflict against Germany. '
