title: 'Review: ''Barry'' takes a whack at its farewell season'
url: https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/entertainment/barry-season-4-review/index.html
summary: '"Barry" has taken chances from the very beginning, which is certainly true
  of a fourth and final season that picks up where the third left off, with its hitman-turned-wannabe
  actor getting arrested. That paves the way for an even darker season that accentuates
  the show''s ensemble aspect while leaning a little too heavily on blurring lines
  with flights of fancy.'
