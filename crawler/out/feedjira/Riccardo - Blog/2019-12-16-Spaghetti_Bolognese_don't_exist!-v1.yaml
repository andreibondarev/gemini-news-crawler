title: Spaghetti Bolognese don't exist!

summary: |-
  Spaghetti bolognese: Everyone knows them&hellip; except Italians.
  Right, read it again if you don&rsquo;t believe me&hellip; in Italy we don&rsquo;t prepare that kind of pasta.
  What the hell, you may be wondering&hellip; Italy is famous for spaghetti and bolognese sauce (that we call &ldquo;ragout alla bolognese&rdquo; or simply rag√º, but we would never mix these two things in the same dish).
  Why oh why, you may as well think? I think the reason can be found in two ways.
