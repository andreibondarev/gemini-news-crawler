  <p>British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak&#8217;s Conservative Party is on track to win fewer than 100 seats in the next election, with Labour likely to score a landslide victory, a new poll suggests.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>A seat-by-seat analysis based on a survey of 15,000 voters sees Sunak’s governing party winning in just 98 constituencies compared to Labour’s 468, the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/general-election-poll-tory-mp-party-cabinet-seats-6ktnbkt7b" target="_blank">Sunday Times reports</a>.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>The poll, conducted by agency <a href="https://www.survation.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.survation.com/" target="_blank">Survation</a> on behalf of the <a href="https://www.bestforbritain.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bestforbritain.org/" target="_blank">Best for Britain</a> campaign group, puts Keir Starmer’s Labour Party at 45 percent of the overall vote, a <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/public-stopped-listening-tories-poll-102914900.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/public-stopped-listening-tories-poll-102914900.html" target="_blank">19-point lead</a> over the Tories. </p>



  <p>Reform U.K., the right-wing populist party set up by Nigel Farage, would score 8.5 percent and win seven seats, with the Liberal Democrats getting 22 seats, according to the survey.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>In Wales and Scotland, the Conservatives would see a complete wipeout, winning no seats, according to the report. The analysis gives the Scottish National Party 41 seats and Plaid Cymru two seats.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>The poll did not account for undecided voters, which represented 15 percent of the people surveyed.&nbsp;</p>
