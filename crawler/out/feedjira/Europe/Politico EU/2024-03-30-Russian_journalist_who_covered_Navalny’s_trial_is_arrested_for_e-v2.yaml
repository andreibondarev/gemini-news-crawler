  <p>Russian journalist Antonina Favorskaya was charged with extremism on Friday and remanded in custody for two months, according to media reports.</p>



  <p>A Moscow court <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-charges-journalist-who-covered-navalny-trials/32883609.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-charges-journalist-who-covered-navalny-trials/32883609.html" target="_blank">formally charged</a> Favorskaya with participating in the activities of late opposition leader Alexei Navalny&#8217;s Anti-Corruption Foundation, which was labeled as extremist in 2021, according to <a href="https://news.sky.com/video/russia-journalist-who-covered-alexei-navalnys-trial-arrested-for-extremism-13104135" data-type="link" data-id="https://news.sky.com/video/russia-journalist-who-covered-alexei-navalnys-trial-arrested-for-extremism-13104135" target="_blank">the reports</a>. The journalist <a href="https://t.me/moscowcourts/2823" data-type="link" data-id="https://t.me/moscowcourts/2823" target="_blank">faces up to six years</a> in prison.</p>



  <p>Favorskaya on Feb. 15 recorded <a href="https://news.sky.com/video/russia-journalist-who-covered-alexei-navalnys-trial-arrested-for-extremism-13104135" data-type="link" data-id="https://news.sky.com/video/russia-journalist-who-covered-alexei-navalnys-trial-arrested-for-extremism-13104135" target="_blank">the last video of Navalny</a> at a court hearing he was taking part in via video-link from an Arctic prison. The next day, Navalny suddenly died in the prison.</p>



  <p>Favorskaya, a correspondent for independent broadcaster Sotavision, was<a href="https://t.me/sotavisionmedia/28588" target="_blank">&nbsp;detained</a>&nbsp;for a <a href="https://t.me/moscowcourts/2823" data-type="link" data-id="https://t.me/moscowcourts/2823" target="_blank">second time on Wednesday</a> after initially serving a 10-day administrative sentence in the Moscow region on charges of disobeying police orders, Sotavision said in a <a href="https://t.me/sotavisionmedia/28588" data-type="link" data-id="https://t.me/sotavisionmedia/28588" target="_blank">post on Telegram</a>.</p>



  <p>She had also extensively covered Navalny&#8217;s funeral in Moscow before she was detained at a cafe on an anonymous tip, the <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/03/28/2-russian-journalists-detained-in-navalny-extremism-case-a84663" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/03/28/2-russian-journalists-detained-in-navalny-extremism-case-a84663" target="_blank">Moscow Times</a> reported. Colleagues of Favorskaya were also detained; the charges against those individuals remain unclear, the newspaper said.</p>



  <p>Prosecutors say Favorskaya posted materials on social media that are <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/russian-court-orders-journalist-navalny-145512645.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/russian-court-orders-journalist-navalny-145512645.html" target="_blank">banned in Russia</a>, AFP reported. In court on Friday, she said the case was retribution for an article she wrote about how Navalny was &#8220;tortured&#8221; in prison, according to the report.</p>



  <p>Navalny&#8217;s team has <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/russian-court-orders-journalist-navalny-145512645.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/russian-court-orders-journalist-navalny-145512645.html" target="_blank">condemned the case</a> and said the Russian regime was trying to create a &#8220;new wave of fear&#8221; among its critics.</p>
