  <br /></p><p>Republicans are on the offensive this week against what they say is
  Democrats’ lack of support for Israel following Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s
  recent criticism of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. House Speaker Mike
  Johnson announced that he will invite Netanyahu to address a joint session of Congress,
  a move he made without first consulting the Senate leader. This comes after President
  Joe Biden and Netanyahu spoke for the first time in more than a month, and after
  Donald Trump, the former president and current Republican presidential nominee,
  accused Jews who support Democrats of hating Israel and their own religion.</p><p>Joining
  the editor in chief of <em>The Atlantic</em> and moderator, Jeffrey Goldberg, this
  week to discuss this and more are Anne Applebaum, a staff writer at <em>The Atlantic</em>;
  Franklin Foer, a staff writer at <em>The Atlantic</em> and the author of <em>The
  Last Politician: Inside Joe Biden’s White House and the Struggle for America’s Future</em>;

  Trump and the End of the Grand Old Party</em>.</p><p>Watch the full episode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbiUI11Cn4s&amp;ab_channel=WashingtonWeekPBS">here</a>.</p><div
