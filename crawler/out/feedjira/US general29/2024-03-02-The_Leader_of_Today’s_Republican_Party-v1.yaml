  <br /></p><p dir="ltr">The race to become the Senate’s top Republican is already
  under way. Mitch McConnell made the surprise announcement this week that he will
  step down from his role as Senate minority leader in November—ending his tenure
  as the longest-serving Senate leader in U.S. history and solidifying former President
  Donald Trump as the leader of today’s Republican Party.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile,
  both President Joe Biden and Trump won their respective primaries on Tuesday, but
  the results underscored vulnerabilities in their 2024 bids for the White House.</p><p
  dir="ltr">Joining the editor in chief of <em>The Atlantic</em> and moderator, Jeffrey
  Goldberg, this week to discuss this and more are Adam Harris, a staff writer for
  <em>The Atlantic</em>; Leigh Ann Caldwell, a co-author of the Early 202 newsletter
  at <em>The Washington Post</em> and an anchor at <em>Washington Post Live</em>;
  Ed O’Keefe, a senior White House and political correspondent at CBS; and Nancy Youssef,
