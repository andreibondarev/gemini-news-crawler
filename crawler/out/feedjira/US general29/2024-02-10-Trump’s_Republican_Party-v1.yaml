Trump is also expected to ask the Supreme Court as early as next week to overturn a federal appeals court’s rejection of his immunity claims.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Trump’s influence on the Republican Party was on display this week on Capitol Hill. The House GOP failed to win key votes, and Senate Republicans blocked a bipartisan border-security package that they themselves had demanded from Democrats.</p><p dir="ltr">Joining the editor in chief of <em>The Atlantic</em> and moderator, Jeffrey Goldberg, this week to discuss this and more are James Bennet, a senior editor at <em>The Economist</em>; John Dickerson, the chief political analyst at CBS News and anchor of <em>CBS News Prime Time With John Dickerson</em>; Josh Gerstein, a senior legal-affairs reporter for <em>Politico</em>; and Amna Nawaz, a co-anchor of <em>PBS NewsHour</em>.</p><div class="oembed" data-oembed-name="www.youtube.com" data-oembed-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj9gS1lQofE&amp;ab_channel=WashingtonWeekPBS">
