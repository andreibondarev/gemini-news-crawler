summary: <p>In discovering the joy of a ready-made community, I have made unexpected
  connections with neighbours who understand grief</p><p>Not long after my mum died,
  I talked to a friend’s mother about grief, and I compared what I was feeling to
  the loss she was experiencing after her husband’s death. She smiled warmly and reached
  out to hold my hand, explaining in the gentlest voice so as not to upset me that
  it was very different because losing your partner, your person, is unlike anything
  else. I didn’t understand it at the time, but I do now. My person died in 2020,
  and while the act of grieving shares many things, the loneliness and emptiness of
  losing the person you share your daily space with is very particular.</p><p>When
  we moved into an apartment building in 2021, it was the tail end of two years of
  Melbourne’s hard lockdowns and a year after my partner had died. Like most households,
  we’d been inside for much of this time, away from the random interactions with strangers
  that usually filled our days. It had been many years since I’d lived in an apartment
  and I’d forgotten the unavoidable intimacy of sharing walls and common spaces with
  so many people.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/31/since-my-husbands-death-the-intimacy-of-apartment-living-has-brought-more-than-just-shared-walls">Continue
