At a hearing today, he bridled at Democratic Senator Al Franken&#8217;s accusation that he&#8217;d &#8212; quote &#8212; &#8220;moved the goalposts&#8221; on the nature of his discussions.</p>
<p><strong>SEN. AL FRANKEN, </strong>D-Minn.: First it was, I didn&#8217;t have communications with Russians, which wasn&#8217;t true. Then it was, I never met with any Russians to discuss any political campaign, which may or may not be true.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s, I didn&#8217;t discuss interference in the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>JEFF SESSIONS, </strong>Attorney General: Well, let me just say without hesitation, that I conducted no improper discussions with the Russians at any time regarding the campaign or any other item facing this country.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Sessions has recused himself from the Justice Department&#8217;s investigation into Russia&#8217;s election meddling.</p>
<p>President Trump had new criticism today for former FBI Director James Comey over the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe. He complained again that Comey decided to clear Clinton before she was even interviewed. That&#8217;s based on newly released draft statements by Comey from May of 2016. FBI officials say it was already clear that no charges were warranted.</p>
<p>On another issue, the president faced fallout over the death of Army Sergeant La David Johnson in Niger this month. Congresswoman Frederica Wilson says she was with Mrs. Johnson when the president called. The Florida Democrat told The Washington Post that Mr. Trump said &#8212; quote &#8212; &#8220;He knew what he was signing up for, but I guess it hurts anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sergeant&#8217;s mother confirmed it, but the president denied it, and White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders went after Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>SARAH SANDERS,</strong> White House Press Secretary: This is a president who loves our country very much, who has the greatest level of respect for men and women in uniform and wanted to call and offer condolences to the family, and I think to try to create something from that, that the congresswoman is doing, is, frankly, appalling and disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> The Post also reported on another incident today. It quoted the father of a soldier killed in Afghanistan as saying the president offered $25,000 from his personal account, but never followed through.</p>
<p>We will get more detail on all of this after the news summary.</p>
<p>The death toll in Northern California&#8217;s wildfires rose to 42 today. Officials in Sonoma County found the remains of the latest victim, as they searched hundreds of burned homes. Meanwhile, fire crews made new gains overnight with the help of cooler weather and low winds.</p>
<p>A two-time Olympic medalist says the former team doctor for U.S. women&#8217;s gymnastics sexually abused her for years. McKayla Maroney is the highest profile athlete to come forward in the scandal. In a statement today, she said Dr. Larry Nassar began molesting her when she was just 13. He&#8217;s awaiting sentencing on a child pornography charge, but has denied any sexual abuse.</p>
<p>More questions tonight about drug pricing. A new study finds the costs of injectable cancer drugs, approved since 1996, rose an average of 25 percent over eight years. That&#8217;s far higher than the rate of inflation. The study was based at Emory University and published in &#8220;The Journal of Clinical Oncology.&#8221;</p>
<p>And on Wall Street, health insurers and IBM fueled a surge in stocks today. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 160 points, more than half-a-percent, to close above 23000 for the first time. The Nasdaq rose just a fraction, and the S&amp;P 500 was up two points.</p>

<p>But beyond the words, Xi is asserting power like no Chinese leader in decades.</p>
<p>William Brangham reports.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> The applause, the music, it was a reception befitting the commanding role that Xi Jinping has taken since being named party leader five years ago.</p>
<p>He opened today&#8217;s proceedings by hailing reforms he&#8217;s put in place, and proclaiming a &#8212; quote &#8212; &#8220;new era for China.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT XI JINPING,</strong> China (through interpreter): The Chinese nation has realized a great leap, from declining in modern history to twisting its fate fundamentally and continuously moving to prosperity.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> Over 3.5 hours, Xi laid out his vision to shape the nation of 1.4 billion people into what he called a &#8212; quote &#8212; &#8220;great modern socialist country&#8221; over the next three decades.</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT XI JINPING</strong> (through interpreter): Achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will be no walk in the park, and it will take more than drumbeating and gong-clanging to get there. The whole party must be prepared to make more arduous, strenuous efforts.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> Susan Shirk is chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego.</p>
<p><strong>SUSAN SHIRK,</strong> University of California, San Diego: Xi Jinping has a vision of China&#8217;s role in the world that is much more ambitious than anything we have seen before, talking about China kind of moving toward the center of the world and having a lot more influence than it did before.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> In his address, Xi largely ignored the question of political reforms in China, and he didn&#8217;t mention President Trump or North Korea&#8217;s nuclear weapons program.</p>
<p>But in a rare move, he did acknowledge that with global demand weakening, there were challenges facing China&#8217;s export-driven economy.</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT XI JINPING</strong> (through interpreter):  While China&#8217;s overall productive forces have significantly improved and in many areas our production capacity leads the world, the more prominent problem is that our development is unbalanced and inadequate.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> Xi was one of the first foreign leaders to meet with President Trump.</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:</strong> The relationship developed by President Xi and myself, I think, is outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> That was decidedly warmer than Mr. Trump&#8217;s past criticism of China and its economic and trade policies.</p>
<p>But other U.S. officials are more critical of Beijing&#8217;s actions.</p>
<p><strong>REX TILLERSON,</strong> Secretary of State: China, while rising alongside India, has done so less responsibly.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> Secretary of State Rex Tillerson today criticized China&#8217;s aggressive displays of economic and military power, particularly its expansion on man-made islands in the South China Sea.</p>
<p><strong>REX TILLERSON:</strong> We will not shrink from China&#8217;s challenges to the rules-based order, and where China subverts the sovereignty of neighboring countries and disadvantages the U.S. and our friends.</p>
<p><strong>SUSAN SHIRK:</strong> I think there are things to worry about in Chinese foreign policy that are mostly related to these maritime sovereignty issues and to a kind of bullying in Asia, but the global ambition could turn out to be positive.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> Susan Shirk says China has filled a vacuum left by the United States&#8217; withdrawal from global agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate accords.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important thing to watch for in the next few days is who Xi establishes as his likely successor.</p>
<p><strong>SUSAN SHIRK:</strong> That is why there is a lot of speculation now that he may be trying, much like Putin, to stay on beyond his normal term or to rule behind the scenes even after he retires.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> President Trump will be traveling to Beijing to meet Xi next month.</p>
