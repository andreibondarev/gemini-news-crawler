            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Co-Author:</strong> <a href="https://medium.com/@zackakil">Zack Akil</a></p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F8xO0-b_XmJA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D8xO0-b_XmJA&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F8xO0-b_XmJA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/49b30e151d1e06040298c0547df7c65b/href">https://medium.com/media/49b30e151d1e06040298c0547df7c65b/href</a></iframe><p>Many of us like to participate in sports, and if you’re competitive at all, you likely want to get better in some way: run faster, be more accurate, have more power, vanquish your opponents — and maybe even look good while doing it.</p><p>One challenge in improving is that some aspects of our performance are hard to measure, and getting access to high quality data and personalized coaching can be difficult — we’re not all on track to be professional athletes, after all. But what if we can get some of that insightful data and analysis with the help of AI?</p><p>Enter one of Google Cloud’s most popular in-person demos that’s gone from London to Berlin to Las Vegas, and is coming to <a href="https://io.google/2024/">Google I/O</a> this week: AI Penalty Challenge! It’s a unique end-to-end interactive soccer coaching experience that uses the latest in Generative AI on Google Cloud, combined with other Cloud and Android technologies. The demo has stolen the show at various events over the last several months and continues to inspire participants to build amazing things with Google.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Xq7COOKJBg3yDWir" /></figure><p><em>(Sidenote: For those outside the US, please feel free to read the word “soccer” as “football” and forgive us for the “misspelling” throughout this article </em>😆<em>.)</em></p><p>The AI Penalty Challenge setup is pretty straightforward, as shown in the video above and explained in <a href="https://youtu.be/Z1wCyhmgMyU?si=rLOVAPUs_aPPMEyB">this one</a>: each participant takes three penalty kicks at a soccer goal, aiming for one of the yellow boxes in the top corners.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*sDwreEMn-oFJtFf1" /></figure><p>The magical part is that each kick is evaluated on power, accuracy, and style within seconds, and afterwards, participants receive personalized feedback from an AI soccer coach and a unique player card as takeaways.</p><p>Let’s dive into the different aspects of this experience in more detail to understand how it works.</p><h3>Recording the Penalty Kick</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*3K7W0ZxL5f_FBeeH" /></figure><p>The first step is to actually record the kicks, which is done using the cameras on six Pixel phones placed in different spots around pitch: one focusing on the goal, one focused on the ball path, one from each side focused on the kicker, and one in each top corner box.</p><p>The camera timing is synchronized using a “referee” tablet that has an app that starts and stops recording between each session. The raw videos are uploaded to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage">Cloud Storage</a> almost immediately after each kick, and are used in replays on screens around the pitch.</p><h3>Triggering Video Analysis in the Cloud</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*K7sHWz-ct-AeL6_P" /></figure><p>When a video hits the specified Cloud Storage bucket, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/eventarc">a Firestore trigger for Eventarc</a> routes the video through a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions">Cloud Function</a> that triggers Python scripts that run the analysis in a serverless way. Results are then sent to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore">Cloud Firestore</a> (stats) and Cloud Storage (images).</p><h3>Measuring Speed and Accuracy</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*d_TFuwIFP1Vw-ict" /></figure><p>Diving more into the actual analysis, custom object detection models trained with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision-ai/docs">Vertex AI Vision</a> are used to track the ball and the goal. Task-specific models shine in cases like these where there is enough labeled training data (images with the types of soccer balls and goals used in the demo) and the desired results are precise position estimates of objects in frame.</p><p>Tracking the ball across frames enables the speed calculation that makes up the power score, and how close the ball is to the closest bin determines the accuracy score. All of this logic is called within a Cloud Function, with the calculated scores going to Cloud Firestore and some visualizations of the kick going to Cloud Storage.</p><h3>Analyzing Style</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*BD79t0uO5IWPnsy4" /></figure><p>The most subjective of the three attributes is style. Leveraging <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/gemini">Gemini in Vertex AI</a>’s multimodality and reasoning ability, a prompt asks the model to look at frames of the kick, analyze how good or creative the kicker’s technique is, and return a style score with the reasoning behind it. With no additional soccer-specific training data (unlike what might be required for a more traditional ML model), Gemini still returns insightful results and explanations about style.</p><p>The style score and reasoning are sent to Cloud Firestore, where the three scores can be averaged together to get a total score for each kick.</p><h3>Coaching Feedback from a Pro</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*N9_BWTt4zBLmIWwg" /></figure><p>Once all three kicks for a given participant have scores, another Firestore trigger for Eventarc initiates another Cloud Function, this time prompting <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/overview#1.5-pro-use-cases">Gemini 1.5 Pro</a> (with extended reasoning ability) with the player’s scores and specific instructions to generate some encouraging constructive feedback in the voice of a soccer coach. The coaching feedback is converted to audio using the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech">Text-to-Speech API</a>, and, with the help of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/custom-voice/docs">Custom Voice</a>, comes out sounding like it came from a professional soccer coach!</p><p>Below are the images and the coaching feedback I received for the three kicks I took at <a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next">Google Cloud Next </a>’24 in Las Vegas.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*cTVOkGQXEm62uRWC" /></figure><p>He’s right: I should focus on driving through the ball more to get more power!</p><h3>Generating a Player Card</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*kR6v_RKV47XmuJFt" /></figure><p>In addition to the practical coaching feedback, participants get another cool takeaway from this experience: a player card featuring their image and stats from their best kick, with a cool AI-generated background. Participants pick their background theme from a variety of types — forest, cosmic, heroic, etc. — and then <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/image/overview">Imagen on Vertex AI</a> takes the kicker image and specific prompt to do <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/image/edit-inpainting">mask-based editing</a>, generating a new image that gets inserted into the player card.</p><p>The result is often something spectacular, like what I got in back in April.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*-bH8gix7azGpz2o5" /></figure><p>What a cool bonus to help memorialize my penalty kick experience!</p><h3>Highlighting Top Performers on a Leaderboard</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*4DzcgsmZSlglZsL2" /></figure><p>No interactive demo experience where people get scores would be complete without a leaderboard, so of course all AI Penalty Challenge events have one. In this case, there’s a web client that renders the top performers along with some stats like total number of kicks for the day or overall event, backed by tables in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/">BigQuery</a> with all the data for every kick.</p><p>After each kick gets analyzed, Firestore triggers a Cloud Function that injects the complete kick stats as a row in BigQuery, so that the leaderboard updates in near real-time. My 80 in Las Vegas wasn’t enough to make the screen, but I’ll console myself knowing that it’s hard to crack the top 20 when there were more than 1000 kicks a day at that particular event!</p><h3>Putting It All Together</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*J4e3pCulpXQjdtLg" /></figure><p>So that’s it: 15+ Google products including some of Cloud’s most exciting AI tools like Gemini, Imagen, and custom text-to-speech — all part of the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai">Vertex AI</a> platform — come together organically to power this one-of-a-kind experience.</p><p>If this gets you excited, look out for the AI Penalty Challenge at an event near you — including Google I/O in Mountain View later this week. And even if you can’t make it to the actual demo, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform">get started with Vertex AI</a> and stay tuned for more detailed architecture breakdowns and code coming soon — hopefully to serve as inspiration to build the next great AI-powered experience with Google Cloud!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=eae42d014659" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/optimize-your-athletic-performance-with-gemini-and-vertex-ai-eae42d014659">Optimize Your Athletic Performance with Gemini and Vertex AI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud">Google Cloud - Community</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost one year ago, I talked about <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">AsyncAPI</a> 2.6 and how confusing its publish and subscribe operations can be in my <a href="https://atamel.dev/posts/2023/05-18_asyncapi_publishsubscribe_refactor">Understanding AsyncAPI&#39;s publish &amp; subscribe semantics with an example</a> post.</p><p>Since then, a new 3.0 version of AsyncAPI has been released with breaking changes and a totally new send and receive operations.</p><p>In this blog post, I want to revisit the example from last year and show how to rewrite it for AsyncAPI 3.0 with the new send and receive operations.</p><h3>AsyncAPI 3.0</h3><p>AsyncAPI 3.0 was released in December 2023. Since it&#39;s a major version, it has some breaking changes. These two pages does a good job explaining the changes and the rationale behind them:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/release-notes-3.0.0">AsyncAPI 3.0.0 Release Notes</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/migration/migrating-to-v3">Migrating to v3</a>.</li></ul><p>I won’t go through all the changes. For me, the biggest change is the separation of operations and channels, and changing publish and subscribe operations to send and receive.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/693/0*JRRNdhOa9QSlg9u_.png" /></figure><h3>Recap: Publish and subscribe operations in AsyncAPI 2.6</h3><p>As a recap, AsyncAPI 2.6 has the following publish and subscribe operations with these semantics:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/783/1*qt82k4Q2nNRNfxRTiEz9xA.png" /></figure><p>In 2.6, publish and subscribe operations are from <strong>user&#39;s perspective</strong>.</p><h3>New: Send and receive operations in AsyncAPI 3.0</h3><p>In 3.0, the publish and subscribe operations are replaced with send and receive operations. In <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/migration/migrating-to-v3">Migrating to v3</a> page, the rationale is given as follows:</p><blockquote>In v2, the publish and subscribe operations consistently caused confusion, even among those familiar with the intricacies.</blockquote><blockquote>When you specified publish, it implied that others could publish to this channel since your application subscribed to it. Conversely, subscribe meant that others could subscribe because your application was the one publishing.</blockquote><blockquote>In v3, these operations have been entirely replaced with an action property that clearly indicates what your application does. That eliminates ambiguities related to other parties or differing perspectives.</blockquote><p>While I agree that publish and subscribe were confusing, I&#39;m not sure if send and receive are less confusing. You still need to talk about whose perspective when defining these operations. AsyncAPI docs talk about <em>application</em> but that&#39;s not clear either. Does application refer to the code sending the message (user) or the code receiving the message (server)?</p><p>In Async 3.0, send and receive operations are from <strong>server&#39;s perspective</strong>. An example will clarify.</p><h3>Account and Email Services</h3><p>Let’s revisit our example from last year. You have two microservices: Account Service emits an userSignedUp event and Email Service receives that event:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*9Ydxd0aMTSxeLya1" /></figure><p>How do you define such an architecture in AsyncAPI 2.6 vs 3.0?</p><h3>Account Service</h3><p>For Account Service, in 2.6, you had to define a channel with subscribe operation because the <strong>user</strong> has to subscribe to receive messages:</p><pre>asyncapi: 2.6.0<br><br>channels:<br>  user/signedup:<br>    subscribe:<br>      operationId: publishUserSignedUp<br>      message:<br>        $ref: &#39;#/components/messages/userSignedUp&#39;</pre><p><a href="https://github.com/meteatamel/asyncapi-basics/blob/main/samples/account-email-services/account-service-2.6.yaml">account-service-2.6.yaml</a></p><p>In 3.0, the channel does not have an operation anymore. Instead, there&#39;s a new publishUserSignedUp operation with send action that refers to the channel. This is because the <strong>server</strong> sends the message:</p><pre>asyncapi: 3.0.0<br><br>channels:<br>  user/signedup:<br>    address: user/signedup<br>    messages:<br>      publishUserSignedUp.message:<br>        $ref: &#39;#/components/messages/userSignedUp&#39;<br><br>operations:<br>  publishUserSignedUp:<br>    action: send<br>    channel:<br>      $ref: &#39;#/channels/user~1signedup&#39;<br>    messages:<br>      - $ref: &#39;#/channels/user~1signedup/messages/publishUserSignedUp.message&#39;</pre><p><a href="https://github.com/meteatamel/asyncapi-basics/blob/main/samples/account-email-services/account-service-3.0.yaml">account-service-3.0.yaml</a></p><h3>Email Service</h3><p>Similarly, in Email Service, in 2.6, you had to define a publish operation because the <strong>user</strong> had to publish a message to the server:</p><pre>asyncapi: 2.6.0<br><br>channels:<br>  user/signedup:<br>    publish:<br>      operationId: receiveUserSignedUp<br>      message:<br>        $ref : &#39;#/components/messages/userSignedUp&#39;</pre><p><a href="https://github.com/meteatamel/asyncapi-basics/blob/main/samples/account-email-services/email-service-2.6.yaml">email-service-2.6.yaml</a></p><p>However, in 3.0, the <strong>server</strong> receives a message, so the operation has receive action:</p><pre>asyncapi: 3.0.0<br><br>channels:<br>  user/signedup:<br>    address: user/signedup<br>    messages:<br>      receiveUserSignedUp.message:<br>        $ref: &#39;#/components/messages/userSignedUp&#39;<br><br>operations:<br>  receiveUserSignedUp:<br>    action: receive<br>    channel:<br>      $ref: &#39;#/channels/user~1signedup&#39;<br>    messages:<br>      - $ref: &#39;#/channels/user~1signedup/messages/receiveUserSignedUp.message&#39;</pre><p>In this blog post, I explored a small part of AsyncAPI and explained the differences between 2.6 operations publish and subscribe and 3.0 operations send and receive. In a nutshell, in 2.6, you need to think from user&#39;s perspective and in 3.0 in server&#39;s perspective when you define these operations.</p><p>If you’re interested in learning more, I have a talk on CloudEvents and AsyncAPI and a repo with some samples:</p><ul><li><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/meteatamel/open-standards-for-building-event-driven-applications-in-the-cloud">Open standards for building event-driven applications in the cloud</a>.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/meteatamel/asyncapi-basics/">asyncapi-basics</a></li></ul><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href="https://atamel.dev/posts/2024/05-13_asyncapi_30_send_receive/"><em>https://atamel.dev</em></a><em>.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=013dd1d6265b" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/asyncapi-gets-a-new-version-3-0-and-new-operations-013dd1d6265b">AsyncAPI gets a new version 3.0 and new operations</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud">Google Cloud - Community</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Securing Anthos Workloads With Chronicle Backstory — A comprehensive approach</h3><p>Implementation process, threat detection strategies, and remediation workflows to get started.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/0*RpN2FuNx2P5E8wai.jpg" /></figure><p>How cool would it be to have a single glass-pane to secure Anthos as well as GKE clusters on the go? Helping implement automation to be granular security findings before it escalates?</p><p>The world of multiple clouds and hybrid systems poses distinct security challenges. The Anthos platform from Google Cloud makes it easier to deploy applications in a variety of environments, but securing these workloads calls for a thorough strategy. With the recent integration of Chronicle Backstory, a threat detection and investigation tool, with Anthos, we can now leverage extended detection and response (XDR) capabilities throughout this intricate environment. This blog delves deeply into the technical aspects of using Chronicle Backstory to secure Anthos workloads, including data ingestion, threat hunting queries, and utilizing the integrations that are already built in.</p><h3>Implementing Backstory with Anthos</h3><p>Chronicle Backstory uses pre-existing data sources to identify potential threats. Our main goal in integrating it with Anthos will be to consume information from two main sources:</p><p><strong>Cloud Audit Logs:</strong> Your GCP projects’ administrative activity, including that of Anthos clusters, is recorded in these logs.<br><strong>GKE Logs: </strong>The Kubernetes Engine (GKE) logs offer valuable information about the activities of containers and possible security incidents that occur in your Anthos workloads.</p><h4>Configuring cloud audit logging for Backstory</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*e6I_qtdeaCqpVhuqPvmYXg.gif" /><figcaption><a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/dM7fV7uT2ZPAD6ZD9">https://images.app.goo.gl/dM7fV7uT2ZPAD6ZD9</a></figcaption></figure><p>We start with enabling cloud audit logs for our GCP project as starters, run the command below to add an IAM binding to the Chronicle ingestor service account.</p><pre>gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \<br>  --member=&quot;serviceAccount:chronicle-ingestor@backstory.iam.gserviceaccount.com:user&quot; \<br>  --role=&quot;roles/logging.logWriter&quot;</pre><p>Now that we have a log ingestor in place we can go ahead and create a logging sink to backstory. With this setup, Anthos cluster activity from Cloud Audit Logs can be ingested by Backstory.</p><pre>gcloud logging sinks create backstory-sink \<br>  --log-filter=&quot;resource.type=cluster&quot; \<br>  --destination=&quot;projects/PROJECT_ID/sinks/backstory-sink&quot; \<br>  --destination-type=backstory</pre><p>Enabling GKE logging for backstory includes two steps:</p><ul><li>Enable Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring for your Anthos cluster.</li><li>Create a sink within Stackdriver Monitoring to export logs to Backstory:</li></ul><pre># Configure the Stackdriver Logging Agent<br>apiVersion: logging.k8s.io/v2<br>kind: LoggingDeployment<br>metadata:<br>  name: backstory-agent<br>spec:<br>  sinkRefs:<br>  - name: &quot;backstory-sink&quot;<br>    namespace: &quot;logging&quot;<br>  # Replace with your Backstory ingestion endpoint<br>  outputDataset: &quot;projects/your-project-id/datasets/anthos-logs&quot;<br>  # Filters to select relevant container logs<br>  selectors:<br>  - expression: &quot;resource.type=k8s_container&quot;<br>---<br># Define the Stackdriver Logging Sink to route logs to Backstory<br>apiVersion: logging.k8s.io/v2<br>kind: LoggingSink<br>metadata:<br>  name: backstory-sink<br>spec:<br>  # Replace with your Backstory ingestion credentials<br>  secretRef:<br>    name: backstory-credentials<br>  destination: <br>    # Configure secure HTTPS destination for Backstory<br>        destination: &quot;https://your-backstory-endpoint.google.com/v2/ingest&quot;<br>    # Define the log format for Backstory ingestion<br>    outputFormat: &quot;json&quot;</pre><p>With this setup, Backstory receives GKE logs from your Anthos workloads that show container activity.</p><h3>Threat Detection With Backstory Queries</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*mkKqN1LfvAgBx4jO.jpg" /></figure><p>Using Chronicle Query Language, Backstory is highly proficient in threat detection (CQL). Here are a few instances:</p><h4>Detecting Suspicious APIs</h4><p>This query finds instances of unauthorized users within Anthos clusters making API calls to the Secrets API.</p><pre>SELECT resource.labels.cluster_name, <br>       timestamp, <br>       protoPayload.methodName, <br>       protoPayload.request.principalEmail <br>FROM audit_log <br>WHERE protoPayload.methodName LIKE &#39;%/v1/secrets%&#39; <br>  AND NOT protoPayload.request.principalEmail LIKE &#39;%admin@yourdomain.com&#39;<br>ORDER BY timestamp DESC;</pre><h4>Unusual Container Activity Detection</h4><p>This query finds containers that crash frequently in Anthos workloads, which may be a sign of suspicious activity.</p><pre>SELECT resource.labels.cluster_name, <br>       container.name, <br>       timestamp, <br>       jsonPayload.reason <br>FROM container <br>WHERE jsonPayload.reason LIKE &#39;%CrashLoopBackOff%&#39; <br>ORDER BY timestamp DESC;</pre><pre># Find container executions with unusual resource usage<br>SELECT process.name, container.name, resource.usage.cpu.usage_in_cores, resource.usage.memory.usage_in_bytes<br>FROM logs<br>WHERE resource.type = &quot;k8s_container&quot;<br>AND resource.usage.cpu.usage_in_cores &gt; (AVG(resource.usage.cpu.usage_in_cores) + 3 * STDDEV(resource.usage.cpu.usage_in_cores))<br>OR resource.usage.memory.usage_in_bytes &gt; (AVG(resource.usage.memory.usage_in_bytes) + 3 * STDDEV(resource.usage.memory.usage_in_bytes))<br>ORDER BY resource.usage.cpu.usage_in_cores DESC, resource.usage.memory.usage_in_bytes DESC</pre><h4>Suspicious Login Attempts</h4><p>This query looks for login attempts made during a specified time period from odd locations. Additional filtering options include user accounts or unsuccessful login attempts.</p><pre>SELECT user_email, source_ip, timestamp<br>FROM events<br>WHERE event_type = &#39;login.attempt&#39; AND<br>timestamp &gt;= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1d) AND<br>geo_country(source_ip) NOT IN (&#39;US&#39;, &#39;GB&#39;)  -- Replace with trusted countries</pre><h4>Potential Lateral Movements</h4><p>This query looks for user activity that may indicate lateral movement across clusters involving multiple GCP resources. Events can be narrowed down by particular resource kinds or activities that take place within a constrained time frame.</p><pre>SELECT user_email, resource_type, resource_name, timestamp<br>FROM events<br>WHERE event_type IN (&#39;resource.create&#39;, &#39;resource.access&#39;)<br>GROUP BY user_email, resource_type, resource_name<br>HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 5  -- Adjust threshold based on expected activity</pre><h4>Unusual File Access</h4><p>This query looks for file access events coming from source IP addresses or unexpected user accounts. Additional filters can be applied based on particular file types or attempts to access data after business hours.</p><pre>SELECT user_email, source_ip, file_path, timestamp<br>FROM events<br>WHERE event_type = &#39;file.access&#39;<br>AND (user_email NOT IN (&#39;admin@example.com&#39;, &#39;service_account@project.com&#39;)  -- Trusted accounts<br>OR geo_country(source_ip) NOT IN (&#39;US&#39;))  -- Trusted location </pre><h3>Remediation?</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*x9a8vmb4z1_JhlwL" /></figure><p>For automated remediation, Backstory integrates with a number of tools. Here are some examples using Cloud Functions (because that’s what I found closest at hand).</p><p>Isolating infected workloads on the cluster requires a cloud function to be triggered via Backstory findings after which we can add the function:</p><pre>def isolate_workload(data, context):<br>  # Extract cluster name and pod details from Backstory alert.<br>  cluster_name = data[&#39;resource&#39;][&#39;labels&#39;][&#39;cluster_name&#39;]<br>  pod_name = data[&#39;container&#39;][&#39;name&#39;]<br><br>  # Use Kubernetes API to cordon the infected node.<br>  from kubernetes import client, config<br>  config.load_kube_config()<br>  v1 = client.AppsV1Api()<br>  v1.patch_namespaced_daemon_set(<br>      &quot;kube-system&quot;, &quot;kube-dns&quot;, body={&quot;spec&quot;: {&quot;template&quot;: {&quot;spec&quot;: {&quot;taints&quot;: [{&quot;effect&quot;: &quot;NoSchedule&quot;, &quot;key&quot;: &quot;infected&quot;}]}}}}<br>  )</pre><p>With the addition of a taint to stop additional pod scheduling, this Cloud Function automatically isolates the compromised node.</p><p>Further, you can implement something like:</p><pre>def remediate_backstory_finding(data, context):<br>  &quot;&quot;&quot;Cloud Function triggered by Backstory detection.&quot;&quot;&quot;<br>  # Parse the Pub/Sub message data<br>  pubsub_message = json.loads(data)<br>  backstory_finding = json.loads(pubsub_message[&quot;data&quot;])<br><br>  # Extract relevant details from the detection<br>  finding_name = backstory_finding[&quot;findingName&quot;]<br>  threat_type = backstory_finding[&quot;externalSystems&quot;][0][&quot;threatType&quot;]<br><br>  # Implement logic for remediation based on threat type<br>  if threat_type == &quot;MALWARE&quot;:<br>    # Example: Isolate the affected workload<br>    print(f&quot;Isolating workload associated with finding: {finding_name}&quot;)<br>    # Replace with your specific isolation workflow (e.g., API call to Anthos)<br>  elif threat_type == &quot;PORT_SCAN&quot;:<br>    # Example: Block suspicious IP addresses<br>    print(f&quot;Blocking suspicious IP addresses from finding: {finding_name}&quot;)<br>    # Replace with your specific IP blocking workflow (e.g., firewall rule update)<br>  else:<br>    print(f&quot;Unrecognized threat type: {threat_type} for finding: {finding_name}&quot;)<br>    # Implement logic for handling unknown threats or sending notifications<br><br></pre><p>A Pub/Sub message with the Backstory detection details in JSON format initiates the function. After parsing the message data, the threat type and finding name are extracted.<br>The function carries out particular remediation actions based on the type of threat. Including examples of workload isolation for malware and IP blocking for port scans in this case.</p><h3>Conclude</h3><p>These are but a few simple instances. Depending on your unique Anthos environment, security posture, and the threats you want to find, you’ll need to modify the queries. As the integration develops, it’s also advised to refer to the official Backstory documentation for the most recent syntax and functionalities.</p><h3>Get in touch??</h3><p><a href="https://linktr.ee/imranfosec">imranfosec | Instagram | Linktree</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=fcf4a9a3a78b" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/securing-anthos-workload-with-chronicle-backstory-a-comprehensive-approchg-fcf4a9a3a78b">Securing Anthos Workload With Chronicle Backstory — A comprehensive approchg</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud">Google Cloud - Community</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this brief article, i am going to show you how to leverage the langchain framework with OpenAI (gpt-4) to work with Google clouds BigQuery vector search offering.</p><p>We are going to use a PDF file which provides a comprehensive overview of trends in AI research and development as of 2023. It covers various aspects of AI advancements including the growth in AI publications, the evolution of machine learning systems, and significant trends in AI conference attendance and open-source AI software. Key highlights include detailed statistics on AI journal, conference, and repository publications categorized by type, field of study, and geographic area.</p><p>This PDF will be converted to text embeddings after which i will show you how to retrieve them using langchain’s <strong>ConversationalRetrievalChain with memory </strong>by creating a retriever object which will point to the embeddings and eventually talk to the PDF using simple search queries.</p><p>So lets begin.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>- You need an active GCP account for this tutorial, even a trial account will do.</p><h4>Step-1: Install the necessary modules in your local environment</h4><blockquote>pip3 install — upgrade langchain langchain_google_vertexai</blockquote><blockquote>pip3 install — upgrade — quiet google-cloud-storage</blockquote><blockquote>pip3 install pypdf</blockquote><h4>Step-2: Create a BigQuery Schema and download credentials file from GCP Account</h4><p>Head over to bigquery, open up an editor and create a schema. Call it <strong>bq_vectordb </strong>and this is the schema where the table which will store our vector embeddings will be created.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-LkhEbUf5INjqNH7uA5jjQ.png" /></figure><p>Now, navigate to <strong>IAM</strong> from the GCP console and select <strong>Service Accounts </strong>from the left navigation. Here we will create and download the permissions json file containing the private key which we will use in the Python script. This json file grants our local environment access to the services in our GCP account on a project level.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*prwgQH8LWrlaiDLv5rO76g.png" /></figure><p>Click on <strong>Manage keys</strong> and then select <strong>ADD KEY</strong> followed by <strong>Create new key. </strong>Thats it, select the key type as JSON and a file will be automatically downloaded to your system.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tMZn_SLrTwt2BRYUpQieEQ.png" /></figure><p>Rename and copy this file to your current working directory.</p><p>That was as far as the environment setup goes, now we can get to the execution part.</p><h4>Step-3: Create and Ingest Embeddings using VertexAIEmbeddings, GCSFileLoader &amp; BigQueryVectorSearch</h4><p>First, we need to create embeddings from the PDF File: <strong>example.pdf</strong> using <strong>VertexAIEmbeddings</strong>. To do that, we load this pdf file from a GCS bucket using <strong>GCSFileLoader</strong> from <strong>langchain</strong> and use the <strong>RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter</strong> to split this pdf into several chunks with an overlap size set to 100.</p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Before you execute the below code, make sure to upload example.pdf to a gcs bucket and change the path values accordingly.</p><blockquote>from langchain_google_vertexai import VertexAIEmbeddings</blockquote><blockquote>from langchain_community.vectorstores import BigQueryVectorSearch</blockquote><blockquote>from langchain.document_loaders import GCSFileLoader</blockquote><blockquote>from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader</blockquote><blockquote>from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter</blockquote><blockquote>import os</blockquote><blockquote>os.environ[‘GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS’] = ‘your-json-filename.json’</blockquote><blockquote>PROJECT_ID = “{project-id}”</blockquote><blockquote>embedding = VertexAIEmbeddings(</blockquote><blockquote>model_name=”textembedding-gecko@latest”, project=PROJECT_ID</blockquote><blockquote>)</blockquote><blockquote>gcs_bucket_name = “your-bucket-name”</blockquote><blockquote>pdf_filename = “test_data/example.pdf”</blockquote><blockquote>def load_pdf(file_path):</blockquote><blockquote>return PyPDFLoader(file_path)</blockquote><blockquote>loader = GCSFileLoader(</blockquote><blockquote>project_name=PROJECT_ID, bucket=gcs_bucket_name, blob=pdf_filename, loader_func=load_pdf</blockquote><blockquote>)</blockquote><blockquote>documents = loader.load()</blockquote><blockquote>text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(</blockquote><blockquote>chunk_size=10000,</blockquote><blockquote>chunk_overlap=100,</blockquote><blockquote>separators=[“\n\n”, “\n”, “.”, “!”, “?”, “,”, “ “, “”],</blockquote><blockquote>)</blockquote><blockquote>doc_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)</blockquote><blockquote>for idx, split in enumerate(doc_splits):</blockquote><blockquote>split.metadata[“chunk”] = idx</blockquote><blockquote>print(f”# of documents = {len(doc_splits)}”)</blockquote><p>Once you have chunked your PDF data, now its time to ingest it into BigQuery vector search.</p><p>Define your dataset (created in the first step) and table name. The table will be created at run time. Next, create an object <strong>BigQueryVectorSearch </strong>and use this object to invoke the <strong>add_documents</strong> method.</p><blockquote>DATASET = “bq_vectordb”</blockquote><blockquote>TABLE = “bq_vectors” # You can come up with a more innovative name here</blockquote><blockquote>bq_object = BigQueryVectorSearch(</blockquote><blockquote>project_id=PROJECT_ID,</blockquote><blockquote>dataset_name=DATASET,</blockquote><blockquote>table_name=TABLE,</blockquote><blockquote>location=”US”,</blockquote><blockquote>embedding=embedding,</blockquote><blockquote>)</blockquote><blockquote>bq_object.add_documents(doc_splits)</blockquote><p>You can execute the entire <strong>bq_ingest_data.py </strong>script<strong> </strong>as a single python script.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ck70GOSwdEcUkUsXMHZHSA.png" /></figure><p>Once the execution is complete, you can head back to Bigquery and refresh your schema. You should see a table <strong>bq_vectors </strong>with the below columns and data. This means your embeddings have been created and are now stored in a BigQuery table.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iBOif5duBgOT-W3BcKMaPw.png" /></figure><h4>Step-4: Retrieve embeddings &amp; use langchain with OpenAI to chat with your data</h4><p>Most of the below code is self-explanatory. We import the necessary libraries and use langchains <strong>ConversationBufferMemory</strong> which will retain the history of the chat in the subsequent messages which, is quite important if you are building a chatbot.</p><p>Make sure to use the actual values in the below script before executing it.</p><blockquote>from langchain_community.vectorstores import BigQueryVectorSearch<br>from langchain_google_vertexai import VertexAIEmbeddings<br>from langchain_google_vertexai import VertexAI<br>from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA<br>from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain<br>from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory<br>from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI<br>import pandas as pd <br>import os</blockquote><blockquote>api_key = “your-openai-api-key”<br>os.environ[‘GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS’] = ‘json-filename.json’</blockquote><blockquote>DATASET = “bq_vectordb”<br>TABLE = “bq_vectors”<br>PROJECT_ID = “project-id”</blockquote><blockquote>embedding = VertexAIEmbeddings(<br> model_name=”textembedding-gecko@latest”, project=PROJECT_ID<br>)</blockquote><blockquote>memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=”chat_history”, return_messages=True,output_key=’answer’)</blockquote><blockquote>bq_object = BigQueryVectorSearch(<br> project_id=PROJECT_ID,<br> dataset_name=DATASET,<br> table_name=TABLE,<br> location=”US”,<br> embedding=embedding,<br>)</blockquote><p>You can execute this code inside a jupyter notebook.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KaswBhP0_5ocyFZi7GdrOA.png" /></figure><p>We now define our <strong>llm model </strong>and create a <strong>retriever</strong> object which will point to the embeddings stored in the bigquery table.</p><blockquote>llm_openai = ChatOpenAI(model=”gpt-4-turbo-2024–04–09&quot;,api_key=api_key)<br>retriever = bq_object.as_retriever()</blockquote><blockquote>conversational_retrieval = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(<br> llm=llm_openai,retriever=retriever, memory=memory,verbose=False<br>)</blockquote><p>Define a function which will simply accept a user query and return the answer from the bigquery vector table.</p><blockquote>def QaWithMemory(query):<br> return conversational_retrieval.invoke(query)[“answer”]</blockquote><p>Now lets ask a question : “ <strong>What was the rate of growth in AI research publications from 2010 to 2021,<br> and which type of AI publication saw the most significant increase in this period?</strong>”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*m3ZA7ojEsmKHbYq11NL84Q.png" /></figure><p>You can see the response. Its quite accurate if you read the PDF content. You can ask a followup question now without giving too many details, such as <strong>“and how might this growth impact the future of AI research priorities?”</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Zivc9_q_VhoaA9U154SFUg.png" /></figure><p>Alright, that was it for this tutorial.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent story highlighted how unauthorized access to an empty AWS S3 bucket can result in surprising charges. This raised the question: can unauthorized access to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) also lead to unexpected bills?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/512/1*7wvAYoDth1XHDtqOA_BJJQ.jpeg" /></figure><h3>Catchup: what happened?</h3><p>A bit over a week ago, an interesting Medium story popped-up into many social feeds:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@maciej.pocwierz/how-an-empty-s3-bucket-can-make-your-aws-bill-explode-934a383cb8b1">How an empty S3 bucket can make your AWS bill explode</a></p><p>It even made into <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40203126">Hacker News frontpage</a>.</p><p>To sum up: a user found that unauthorized 403 requests to upload files to his AWS S3 empty bucket by other users were billed to his account, as his bucket ID was used as a default value into a popular open-source solution and thousands of deployments tried by mistake to upload backup data into his bucket.</p><p><strong>This was quite worrisome</strong>, as could be exploited by a malicious actor to bring anyone down just knowing any of our S3 bucket IDs: not by DoS but by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cybersecurity/article/10/1/tyae004/7634012">Denial-of-Wallet attacks</a>.</p><p>This bore the question — <em>would this also happen on Google Cloud Storage?</em></p><p>Spoiler alert: <strong><em>no, 403 PUT requests are not billed in GCS.</em></strong></p><h3>Considerations</h3><h4>Base scenario</h4><p>The original story stated that 403 non-authorized requests to AWS S3 were billed.</p><p>We wanted to also verify whether in Google Cloud Storage 403 non-authorized PUT requests to private GCS buckets are billed or not.</p><h4>Number of requests</h4><p>As per the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#operations-by-class">GCS pricing docs</a>, listing and uploading objects are billed as <em>Class A operations</em> and downloading/reading objects as <em>Class B operations</em>. Pricing is per 1000 operations, so we aimed for a adequate number of requests to make sure we would notice the charges.</p><h4>Requester pays disabled</h4><p>In GCS and S3 you can opt-in for “requester pays”, where the user making the request is paying for it instead of the bucket’s owner, which is intended for other scenarios e.g. sharing public data, rather than e.g. public website static date. Therefore, it was intentionally disabled, as is the usual configuration.</p><h4>“Always free” tier and billing exports</h4><p>In Google Cloud, there is a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features#storage">free tier for Cloud Storage</a> for some amount of Class A and B operations, so it would mask the costs of our requests.</p><p>Therefore, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/export-data-bigquery">detailed usage cost data</a> was exported to BigQuery and analyzed using SQL, where we could see the charges for operations even if they would fall in this free tier or be subjected to credits, discounts and promotions.</p><p>This cost data is exported to BigQuery with some latency (usually several hours, depending on service and SKU), so results were checked after 24 hours.</p><h3>Simulating unauthorized access: the experiment</h3><p>2 Google Cloud projects were created:</p><ol><li><em>gcs-unauthorized-requests</em></li><li><em>gcs-requesting-instance</em></li></ol><p><em>Note: Usually you would want to keep your project IDs private for security.</em></p><h4>Billing</h4><p>Billing was configured for both projects with an active, good-standing billing account, with detailed usage cost data exported to BigQuery.</p><h4>Details for gcs-unauthorized-requests project</h4><ul><li>Required roles: Cloud Storage Admin</li><li>Enabled APIs: Cloud Storage (<em>storage.googleapis.com</em>), BigQuery (<em>bigquery.googleapis.com</em>, to analyze exported billing data, could also be run in another project)</li><li>Cloud Storage resources: location — <em>regional</em>, <em>europe-southwest1</em>, storage class — <em>standard</em></li><li>Private bucket: bucket-name-redacted, label bucket-private</li></ul><h4>Details for gcs-requesting-instance project</h4><ul><li>Required roles: Compute Engine Admin, Service Account Admin</li><li>Enabled APIs: Compute Engine (<em>compute.googleapis.com</em>)</li><li>Networking — VPC &amp;

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is mirrored from my personal website </em><a href="https://leoy.blog"><em>leoy.blog</em></a><em>. See reader-friendly </em><a href="https://leoy.blog/posts/google-cloud-slo-demystified/"><em>original</em></a><em>. This material was prepared with help from </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethantruong/"><em>Ethan Truong</em></a><em>.</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/799/1*MHwc3EM1GjxKpsDXL3YCTQ.png" /></figure><p>Google Cloud supports <a href="https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/slo-monitoring"><strong>service monitoring</strong></a> by defining and tracking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_objective"><strong>SLO</strong></a> of the services based on their metrics that are ingested to Google Cloud. This support greatly simplifies implementing SRE practices for services that are deployed to Google Cloud or that store telemetry data there. To make it even more simple to developers, the service monitoring is able to automatically detect many types of managed services and supports predefined <em>availability</em> and <em>latency</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_level_indicator"><strong>SLI</strong></a> definitions for them.<br>When you define a new SLO you are prompted to select a predefined SLI or to define your own.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/757/0*78QiebDtoB3PG1KF.png" /></figure><p>While it is convenient to use predefined SLIs you aren’t provided with information about SLI definitions. If you already defined an SLO using one of predefined SLIs, you can get its detailed description using the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/services.serviceLevelObjectives/get"><strong>services.serviceLevelObjectives.get</strong></a> API. For example, the following command returns JSON payload that describes the SLO named availability_slo of the frontend service that was defined using the predefined availability SLI:</p><pre>curl -X GET \<br>https://monitoring.googleapis.com/v3/projects/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/\<br>services/frontend/\<br>serviceLevelObjectives/frontend-availability-slo?view=EXPLICIT \<br>-H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)&quot; \<br>-H &quot;Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8&quot;</pre><p>This example uses gcloud <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud"><strong>CLI</strong></a> and the environment variable GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT. This variable is automatically set by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/launching-cloud-shell"><strong>Cloud Shell</strong></a>. However, if you run this command in your shell, you will need to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk"><strong>install</strong></a> gcloud, then to authenticate vs Google Cloud and to set up the GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT environment variable to the project ID where your SLO is defined. The following paragraphs describe predefined SLIs to enable you to make an educated choice next time you use them.</p><h3>Managed (auto-detected) services</h3><p>The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/slo-monitoring/api/using-api#managing-services"><strong>managed services</strong></a> generate metrics that are further used to calculate predefined SLIs. The service monitoring automatically detects these managed services or the user can provision them manually. As long as the service is defined as one of the basic services and uses one of the following types, it can leverage the predefined SLIs.</p><ul><li>APP_ENGINE – Every <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/testing-and-deploying-your-app"><strong>deployed application</strong></a> is considered a service. This service can be monitored using multiple ways including SLOs.</li><li>ISTIO_CANONICAL_SERVICE – When vanilla Istio is configured to ingest its metrics to Cloud Monitoring, its services are auto-detected as Istio canonical services. GKE workloads that leverage the managed version of Istio (aka <a href="https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh"><strong>ASM</strong></a>) do not use this type.</li><li>CLUSTER_ISTIO – Services that run on GKE with ASM are identified as Cluster Istio services. Note that since ASM supports Kubernetes clusters on Azure and AWS you can implement service monitoring for these clusters as well.</li><li>CLOUD_RUN – Cloud Run <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/overview/what-is-cloud-run#services"><strong>services</strong></a> are auto-detected using this type. Important to remember that service monitoring does not support Cloud Run jobs.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>NOTE:</strong> Not all services that Service monitoring automatically detects, have predefined SLIs. For example, services of types GKE_SERVICE or GKE_WORKLOAD do not have predefined SLIs (because they do not ingest any metrics to Google Cloud).</blockquote><h3>Predefined SLIs</h3><p>All predefined SLIs are measured in % and calculated based on the well known formula of</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/321/0*SFvP6lTuqqsst9Qp.jpg" /></figure><p>The predefined SLIs use a <strong>resource type</strong> and a <strong>metric</strong> to get the event data. The <strong>availability metric</strong> is used to get availability events and the <strong>latency metric</strong> is used to get latency events. From all metric data the good events are derived using a <strong>good service filter</strong> and valid events — using the union of <strong>good service filter</strong> <em>AND</em> <strong>bad service filter</strong>. The filters are built using metric labels and leverage the fact that both availability and latency metrics have the same set of labels. You can use the following MQL query to see the <em>valid events</em>:</p><pre>fetch %%resource%%<br>| metric &#39;%%metric%%&#39;<br>| filter (%%good_service_filter%%) || (%%bad_service_filter%%)</pre><p>And this MQL query to see the <em>good events</em>:</p><pre>fetch %%resource%%<br>| metric &#39;%%metric%%&#39;<br>| filter %%good_service_filter%%</pre><blockquote><strong>NOTE:</strong> You will have to replace values enclosed with double percentage (%%) with the actual values of the predefined SLIs.</blockquote><h3>AppEngine service</h3><p>Detects both standard and flexible AppEngine services.</p><p><strong>Resource type</strong>: gae_app</p><p><strong>Availability metric</strong>: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#appengine/http/server/response_count"><strong>appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_count</strong></a></p><p><strong>Latency metric</strong>: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#appengine/http/server/response_latencies"><strong>appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies</strong></a></p><p><strong>Good service filter</strong>:</p><pre>resource.module_id = &#39;MODULE_ID&#39; &amp;&amp;<br>metric.response_code &gt;= 200 &amp;&amp; metric.response_code &lt;= 299</pre><blockquote><strong>NOTE:</strong> MODULE_ID should be replaced with the actual AppEngine service/module name.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>GCP Cross-region internal application load balancer : why and how</h3><p>Context :</p><p>A Google Cloud<strong><em> internal Application Load Balancer</em></strong> is a proxy-based layer 7 load balancer that enables you to run and scale your services behind a single internal IP address. The internal Application Load Balancer distributes HTTP and HTTPS traffic to backends hosted on a variety of Google Cloud platforms such as Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and Cloud Run. This load balancer is available in 2 flavors :</p><ol><li>Regional internal application load balancer</li><li>Cross-regional internal application load balancer</li></ol><p>The cross-region internal application load balancer enables you to load balance traffic to backend services that are globally distributed, including traffic management that ensures traffic is directed to the closest backend.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/911/0*1RXP-_RyrxR_ngJ6" /></figure><p>The idea of this blog post is to see how cross-regional internal application load balancer is deployed and its use-cases under steady state and failover situations.</p><p>Failover may fall in 2 categories : (a) failover of a regional backend (b) failover of iLB frontend</p><ul><li>Failover of Frontend: When the proxy tasks in a region (where the forwarding rule is configured) fail. Failover to a forwarding rule in a different region is done using a DNS failover policy.</li><li>Failover of Backend: When all of the backends (e.g. VM instances) in a region fail, the load balancer automatically chooses healthy, available backends in the next closest region.</li></ul><h3>Topology</h3><p>In the test topology used in this blog , I had one VPC with subnets in 2 regions : asia-south1 ( Mumbai) and asia-south2 ( Delhi ) . The CIDR used in each subnet is shown in the topology diagram below . These 2 subnets host the instance groups where web application servers are hosted.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*XsF-O-_jjjgd-dLW" /></figure><p>As a next step ( and a mandatory step ) for setting up cross regional internal application load balancer , it is necessary to reserve PROXY subnet for each region in context . In my example , I have reserved 2 proxy subnets ( one each for asia-south1 and asis-south2 )</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/742/0*jCHDHuwtb6bpguLO" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*tZyjIMJGJNJCbZ9h" /></figure><p>Setup Load balancer : Lets break this in 3 simple parts</p><ol><li>Front end setup</li><li>Backend setup</li><li>Routing rules</li></ol><p><strong>Front End :</strong> Create one front end per region .

Customer relied on making separate entries in DNS for each front end and this was used by respective clients in their application access method. The load balancer served traffic from closest healthy backend available.</p><h3>TEST # 2</h3><p>Client sending traffic to cross-regional front-end : This is continuation of test case 1 , where the requirement is to access a workload in a cross-region ; i.e. client in asia-south1 (Mumbai) trying to access workload in asia-south2 by accessing front end name / IP of layer7 iLB in asia-south2 region</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*5xlcWKelOS-SYrhF" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4gFU4GGLPR868OnKlK-chg.png" /></figure><p>Hence , once the requests land on a iLB frontend , it tries to route it to a healthy backend nearest to it</p><h3>TEST # 3</h3><p>Failover Scenario : In this case , let’s assume service in asia-south2 failed ( Or all VMs down ) . For simulation in my setup , I removed the backend in Delhi region from the iLB backend service configuration.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*5V3H5pYuX7hmvtDc" /></figure><p>Lets see the results</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NPgfHr0OtxKuAAAPfwG98Q.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zz7jqMMh8ezDuhxHai22CQ.png" /></figure><p>Hence , as expected , in event of no healthy backend , the iLB will redirect the traffic to healthy backends in next closest region.</p><h3>TEST # 4</h3><p>Combining Cross region ILB functionality with GCP CLOUD DNS GEO routing POLICY</p><p>This is most interesting usecase . Here ; instead of using separate domain names for application hosted in asia-south1 / asia-south2, the customer created a domain name called “<a href="http://application.myapp.com">application.myapp.com</a>”. In addition to this , customer created a GEO routing policy specifying region as ‘asia-south1’ resolve to 10.10.152.10 [ load balancer front end in asia-south1 ] and asia-south2 resolve ot 10.10.151.11 [ load balancer front end in asia-south1 ] . Sample DNS configuration is as follows -</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*u81MR6Lacpz10SnG" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eNvPTqsf_g-1OAKE" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A-AcPldmLJwaN4B4R8RFHQ.png" /></figure><p>When client attempted to access the app behind<strong> </strong><a href="http://application.myapp.com">application.myapp.com</a><strong> </strong>; the response came from the nearby region</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*w1m9uOolhhvormxUGHsUXg.png" /></figure><p>BACKEND FAILOVER ( no healthy backend in one of region )</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*QST9fnimdqhQMzGi" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0hChkmK94Q9SMUc8Qdhq9w.png" /></figure><p>Again , as expected , no matter which frontend IP the query lands , iLB send the request to nearby healthy backend. For example , if client in Delhi region sends request to front-end in Delhi-region of iLB , this will be routed to next near healthy backend ( which is Mumbai in my setup )</p><h3>TEST # 5</h3><p>This test has to do with failover of proxy task in a given region . This is where Failover Policy of Cloud DNS can come handy.</p><p>In this setup , customer needs to serve everything from Asia-south1 application instance and if this is not available / reachable ; asia-south2 instance shall be considered .</p><p>Lets look at Cloud DNS Failover Policy</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7fuPsVppPUXHl6cxa31kaA.png" /></figure><p>This simply means that clients will resolve to iLB frontend IP address in Asia-south1 ( 10.10.152.10 ) and if this isnt reachable ; clients in both regions will resolve app1.myapp.com to iLB front-end IP in asia-south2 ( 10.10.151.12 )</p><p>Hence in steady state the setup will work like follows</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sQ5ubMo1PNetYpbPngKuUQ.png" /></figure><p>However in case of Front end fail , the setup will work like following</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*93E6z75MsUUVRDhMInYsRw.png" /></figure><p>Useful URLs</p><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/l7-internal/setting-up-l7-cross-reg-internal">Setup cross-regional internal L7 load balancer</a></p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This is to inform readers that the views, thoughts, and opinions expressed in the text belong solely to the author, and not necessarily to the author’s employer, organization, committee or other group or individual.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f3a33226d690" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/gcp-cross-region-internal-application-load-balancer-why-and-how-f3a33226d690">GCP Cross-region internal application load balancer : why and how</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud">Google Cloud - Community</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learn how to quickly create a chatbot over your API using Vertex AI Extensions. No coding or training required. Interact with your API seamlessly through a chat interface. Read more to explore the possibilities!</p><h3>What is API?</h3><p>An API (Application Programming Interface) serves as a bridge between various software programs. It defines a set of rules and requirements that apps may follow to interact with one another.</p><h3>What is Chatbot?</h3><p>A software program that simulates human-user conversations. Chatbots are frequently used in messaging apps, websites, and customer service to offer information or do tasks.</p><p><strong>Traditionally</strong>, a Chatbot is trained on intents to understand which data to be fetched, what all parameters are required and how to extract them from the prompt given by user and at the end format the API response for easy reading. This will improve readability for the user.</p><h4><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></h4><p>If any changes are made to API, like taking in a new parameter, change in the response from API, in that case, we will have to make the changes in the chatbot as well to handle the new changes. Similarly, if a new API is added, then the whole process of creating intent, extracting parameters, prettifying API response.</p><h4><strong>Solution:</strong></h4><p>Using Extension in Vertex AI, to build Chatbots over your API. How to do it?? Just follow the steps below!!</p><blockquote><strong>Disclaimer: Extensions in Vertex AI is still in PREVIEW. It </strong>Is under development and gaining functionalities.</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NzBLlx8ssBksQoAYY9f9Yg.jpeg" /><figcaption>AI Generated by SDXL 1.0</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>How to Build a Chatbot over your API?</strong></h4><ol><li>Create a sample <a href="https://swagger.io/docs/specification/basic-structure/"><strong><em>OpenAPI specification file</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong>(only yaml file supported till now). I have used a sample file from <a href="https://petstore.swagger.io/#/"><strong>swagger</strong></a><strong> </strong>and trimmed down the file to only include API related to pets.</li><li>Login to Google cloud console, and navigate to <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/extensions"><strong>Extensions in Vertex AI</strong></a>. Click on “Create Extension”</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/967/1*XhAbnI0WjAi2LwiGO9NqRg.png" /></figure><p>3. Enter the name that you want to give to the extension, we have given name as “pet_store”. Then enter any description that you want and in the Extension Type, Click on <strong>“Custom”. </strong><em>(For other 2 Extension Types stay tuned and follow, I am going to soon write about them)</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/736/1*n4HJxa0_rimgxzJN0EoN5w.png" /></figure><p>4. Once you select Custom Extension Type, you will get a below form, just enter details according to your API. In the OpenAPI Spec file section, upload you YAML file created in STEP 1.</p><p>If there are no error, you would get the below confirmation as “No errors detected”. Along with that it will also list down all the APIs that are present in the YAML file. (as seen in the below image). For this demo, with will select “No Authentication”, but if your application requires authentication you can set that up in the “Authentication” dropdown.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/620/1*a1AYbiYTqah3RI1vpg6tGg.png" /></figure><p>5. Once the extension is created you would see a screen like shown below. This shows that your Chatbot is ready and you can query it in the below text box. Let us try some examples and check.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VTDjZCc7YoZULPsMZN79Cw.png" /></figure><h4>Testing the Chatbot:</h4><ol><li>Lets try to create a new pet in our pet store. I just put the query as “add a pet” and it was quickly able to understand what are the required parameters to create a pet. So the bot asked me one by one to enter the name and then the id for our new pet. Once it got all the required information, it created the pet.</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Xj_zCG3FaOXULUAbx4gNlw.jpeg" /></figure><p>2. Let’s try to get the information for our newly created pet. When I ask “get pet”, it understood that there is not API to get all pets and hence asked me for an id. Once the id is entered, the chatbot was able to fetch the information for the pet we just now created.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aY_yRDGdq3PUsFbJ7COFOw.jpeg" /></figure><p>3. Let’s add one more pet. When queried for “add a pet”, it asked for the name, then id and then finally the status. Notice how it gave me the options for status (available, pending or sold). This is because these are the options mentioned in the YAML file for the status field.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GAioFu8z194NXUT8eqYVnA.jpeg" /></figure><p>4. Let’s try to get the new pet that we created. The Chatbot gets the complete information when the id is entered.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AqY7U5u3i0Fqz3Kolsnd9Q.jpeg" /></figure><p>5. Now let us try to update the pet and see if the bot is able to handle it. So when I query “update pet”, it asks for the id, and then asks what field i need to update, is it name or status. So when I enter “status is sold”, it updates that and gives the response for the successful status update.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vxeEJ46eOZUPZC9R70CPIg.jpeg" /></figure><p>6. To be actually sure if the value is updated in backend or not, I tried to get the pet infomation. But this time, in the first query itself i have the id and did a query as “get pet 123”. This time the Chatbot got the id and did not ask again for the id. In the very next step, it has come back with the response saying the pet with id 123 is sold.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1013/1*XnLPpJCCto9yMK2FT4YuXg.jpeg" /></figure><p>7. Finally, lets now try to delete the pet. When I query “delete pet”, the Chatbot asks me for the id, and when the id is entered it deletes that entry for pet with id 123.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1010/1*4opSTPvFIBWlGFsfxmjObg.jpeg" /></figure><p>As seen above, We were able to interact with our API, perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) through the Chatbot which required no training, no coding!!</p><h3>Opportunities for improvement<strong>:</strong></h3><ol><li>It only supports Content Type with “application/JSON” for input and output.</li><li>Currently it does not work with query parameters.</li><li>There should be an option to update the YAML file once uploaded. Currently to update the YAML, you would have to delete the old Extension and create a new one.</li><li>Currently it only supports calling the Chatbot through REST API or through GCP console. It would be great to have it integrated in the Vertex AI SDK.</li></ol><h3>Conclusions:</h3><ol><li>It have become very easy to create a Chatbot over your APIs.</li><li>You won’t have to train the Chatbot again once new APIs are added.</li><li>You won’t have to manage the context and parameter values given by the user.</li></ol><h3>If you enjoyed this post, give it a clap! 👏 👏</h3><h3>Interested in similar content?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*K83VzvK4cZWYiMUiLK9A2w.png" /></figure><h3>Intro</h3><p>I was fighting recently with approach for granting time-based access to my organization. I didn’t wanted to use 3rd party solution like CyberArk (which is super great). I wanted to utilize something cloud native, provided by vendor. I found open-community project called “Just-in-time”. That was fantastic approach at that time. But today I’ve discovered that Google Cloud pushed into Pre-GA phase service called Privileged Access Manager (PAM)</p><p>➡️ More info about JIT <a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/manage-just-in-time-privileged-access-to-project">here</a></p><h3>Short info about PAM</h3><p>Privileged Access Manager (PAM) is a security solution designed to manage, monitor, and secure access to privileged accounts within an organization’s IT infrastructure. These privileged accounts typically have elevated permissions and access to sensitive resources, making them a prime target for cyber attackers.</p><p>You can use PAM in following situations:</p><ul><li>As a general practice, instead of permanently granting roles. Combined with approvals and justifications, this lets you manage access to sensitive resources without resorting to permanently over-permissioned principals. You can also use PAM to audit when granted roles were active for a principal, what resources were accessible during that time, what the justification was for that access, and who approved the access.</li><li>For select emergency responders, to allow them to perform critical tasks without having to wait for approval. You can require justifications for additional context on why the emergency access is needed.</li><li>For service accounts, to only grant them roles when they need the roles to perform an automated task.</li><li>For contractors, to allow temporary access to resources during business hours that requires approvals and justifications.</li></ul><h3>How to enable PAM</h3><p>PAM can be configured at the organization, folder, or project level. You need also mandatory permissions to do that, so before you start:</p><p>Grant you the following IAM roles on the organization, folder, or project:</p><ul><li>To create, update, and delete entitlements: Privileged Access Manager Admin (roles/privilegedaccessmanager.admin). Additionally, either Folder IAM Admin (roles/resourcemanager.folderIamAdmin), Project IAM Admin (roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin), or Security Admin (roles/iam.securityAdmin)</li><li>To view entitlements and grants: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#privilegedaccessmanager.viewer">Privileged Access Manager Viewer </a>(roles/privilegedaccessmanager.viewer)</li><li>To view audit logs: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#logs.viewer">Logs Viewer </a>(roles/logs.viewer)</li></ul><p>The following permissions are required to work with entitlements and grants:</p><ul><li>To enable PAM at the organization, folder, or project scope:</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.locations.checkOnboardingStatus</li><li>resourcemanager.organizations.get</li><li>resourcemanager.organizations.getIamPolicy</li><li>resourcemanager.organizations.setIamPolicy</li><li>resourcemanager.folders.get</li><li>resourcemanager.folders.getIamPolicy</li><li>resourcemanager.folders.setIamPolicy</li><li>resourcemanager.projects.get</li><li>resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy</li><li>resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy</li><li>To manage entitlements and grants:</li><li>resourcemanager.folders.get</li><li>resourcemanager.organizations.get</li><li>resourcemanager.projects.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.create</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.delete</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.list</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.setIamPolicy</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.grants.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.grants.list</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.grants.revoke</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.locations.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.locations.list</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.operations.delete</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.operations.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.operations.list</li><li>To view entitlements and grants:</li><li>resourcemanager.folders.get</li><li>resourcemanager.organizations.get</li><li>resourcemanager.projects.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.list</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.grants.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.grants.list</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.locations.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.locations.list</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.operations.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.operations.list</li><li>To view audit logs: logging.logEntries.list</li></ul><p>You might also be able to get these permissions with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles">custom roles</a> or other <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles">predefined roles</a>.</p><p>➡️ More info about managing accesses can be found <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access">here</a></p><p>Once granted, complete following steps to enable PAM:</p><ol><li>Go to the <strong>Privileged Access Manager</strong> page.</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/637/1*3guT0c9zLqp8yYEBwBY5Cw.png" /><figcaption>Fig1. PAM</figcaption></figure><p>2. Select the organization, folder, or project that you want to enable PAM for.</p><p>ℹ️ Enabling PAM for an organization or folder also enables PAM for all folders and projects below them in the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy">resource hierarchy</a>.</p><p>3. Click <strong>Enable PAM</strong> to enable the service for the selected resource scope. 4. When asked to grant the <strong>Privileged Access Manager Service Agent</strong> role to the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-types#service-agents">Privileged Access Manager Service Agent</a> to manage privilege escalations, click <strong>Grant role</strong>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/776/1*AQ6v4M_B9nHjps7pIuX4pQ.png" /><figcaption>Fig2. Complete setup for PAM</figcaption></figure><p>5. Click <strong>Complete setup</strong>.</p><h3>How to create entitlements</h3><p>Once PAM has been enabled, we are able to create entitlements.</p><blockquote>Entitlements can be created at the organization, folder, or project level. Roles granted by an entitlement at each level follow the Google Cloud <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/resource-hierarchy-access-control">resource hierarchy</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>For example, roles granted by an entitlement at the organization level are inherited at the folder and project levels.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-create-entitlements">https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-create-entitlements</a></blockquote><h4>Before you begin</h4><p>Make sure you have <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-permissions-and-setup">enabled PAM and set up permissions for it</a>.</p><p>To create entitlements complete following steps:</p><ol><li>Go to the <strong>Privileged Access Manager</strong> page.</li><li>Select the organization, folder, or project you want the entitlement to apply to.</li><li>Click the <strong>Entitlements</strong> tab.</li><li>Click <strong>Create</strong>.</li><li>You will see following image.

Additionally, you can configure entitlement to being approved automatically by ticking “Activate access without approvals” checkbox.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/537/1*2X7aj1G7S3ueS6x_YoF7UA.png" /><figcaption>Fig5. Adding approvers</figcaption></figure><p>8. You can add additional notifications emails if for example you want to notify customers also about entitlement.</p><blockquote>Add the email addresses of people to notify when the entitlement is available to request, when a grant is pending approval, and when a requester is granted access. Google identities associated with the entitlement, like approvers and requesters, are automatically notified. However, you might want to notify a different set of email addresses, especially if you’re using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation">Workforce Identity Federation</a>.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-create-entitlements">https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-create-entitlements</a></blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/526/1*3P0BjHgaihkTMPIhM_gj6Q.png" /><figcaption>Fig6.
