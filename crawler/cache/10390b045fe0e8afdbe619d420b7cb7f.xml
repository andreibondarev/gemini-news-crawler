            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent story highlighted how unauthorized access to an empty AWS S3 bucket can result in surprising charges. This raised the question: can unauthorized access to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) also lead to unexpected bills?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/512/1*7wvAYoDth1XHDtqOA_BJJQ.jpeg" /></figure><h3>Catchup: what happened?</h3><p>A bit over a week ago, an interesting Medium story popped-up into many social feeds:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@maciej.pocwierz/how-an-empty-s3-bucket-can-make-your-aws-bill-explode-934a383cb8b1">How an empty S3 bucket can make your AWS bill explode</a></p><p>It even made into <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40203126">Hacker News frontpage</a>.</p><p>To sum up: a user found that unauthorized 403 requests to upload files to his AWS S3 empty bucket by other users were billed to his account, as his bucket ID was used as a default value into a popular open-source solution and thousands of deployments tried by mistake to upload backup data into his bucket.</p><p><strong>This was quite worrisome</strong>, as could be exploited by a malicious actor to bring anyone down just knowing any of our S3 bucket IDs: not by DoS but by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cybersecurity/article/10/1/tyae004/7634012">Denial-of-Wallet attacks</a>.</p><p>This bore the question — <em>would this also happen on Google Cloud Storage?</em></p><p>Spoiler alert: <strong><em>no, 403 PUT requests are not billed in GCS.</em></strong></p><h3>Considerations</h3><h4>Base scenario</h4><p>The original story stated that 403 non-authorized requests to AWS S3 were billed.</p><p>We wanted to also verify whether in Google Cloud Storage 403 non-authorized PUT requests to private GCS buckets are billed or not.</p><h4>Number of requests</h4><p>As per the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#operations-by-class">GCS pricing docs</a>, listing and uploading objects are billed as <em>Class A operations</em> and downloading/reading objects as <em>Class B operations</em>. Pricing is per 1000 operations, so we aimed for a adequate number of requests to make sure we would notice the charges.</p><h4>Requester pays disabled</h4><p>In GCS and S3 you can opt-in for “requester pays”, where the user making the request is paying for it instead of the bucket’s owner, which is intended for other scenarios e.g. sharing public data, rather than e.g. public website static date. Therefore, it was intentionally disabled, as is the usual configuration.</p><h4>“Always free” tier and billing exports</h4><p>In Google Cloud, there is a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features#storage">free tier for Cloud Storage</a> for some amount of Class A and B operations, so it would mask the costs of our requests.</p><p>Therefore, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/export-data-bigquery">detailed usage cost data</a> was exported to BigQuery and analyzed using SQL, where we could see the charges for operations even if they would fall in this free tier or be subjected to credits, discounts and promotions.</p><p>This cost data is exported to BigQuery with some latency (usually several hours, depending on service and SKU), so results were checked after 24 hours.</p><h3>Simulating unauthorized access: the experiment</h3><p>2 Google Cloud projects were created:</p><ol><li><em>gcs-unauthorized-requests</em></li><li><em>gcs-requesting-instance</em></li></ol><p><em>Note: Usually you would want to keep your project IDs private for security.</em></p><h4>Billing</h4><p>Billing was configured for both projects with an active, good-standing billing account, with detailed usage cost data exported to BigQuery.</p><h4>Details for gcs-unauthorized-requests project</h4><ul><li>Required roles: Cloud Storage Admin</li><li>Enabled APIs: Cloud Storage (<em>storage.googleapis.com</em>), BigQuery (<em>bigquery.googleapis.com</em>, to analyze exported billing data, could also be run in another project)</li><li>Cloud Storage resources: location — <em>regional</em>, <em>europe-southwest1</em>, storage class — <em>standard</em></li><li>Private bucket: bucket-name-redacted, label bucket-private</li></ul><h4>Details for gcs-requesting-instance project</h4><ul><li>Required roles: Compute Engine Admin, Service Account Admin</li><li>Enabled APIs: Compute Engine (<em>compute.googleapis.com</em>)</li><li>Networking — VPC &amp;

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is mirrored from my personal website </em><a href="https://leoy.blog"><em>leoy.blog</em></a><em>. See reader-friendly </em><a href="https://leoy.blog/posts/google-cloud-slo-demystified/"><em>original</em></a><em>. This material was prepared with help from </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethantruong/"><em>Ethan Truong</em></a><em>.</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/799/1*MHwc3EM1GjxKpsDXL3YCTQ.png" /></figure><p>Google Cloud supports <a href="https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/slo-monitoring"><strong>service monitoring</strong></a> by defining and tracking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_objective"><strong>SLO</strong></a> of the services based on their metrics that are ingested to Google Cloud. This support greatly simplifies implementing SRE practices for services that are deployed to Google Cloud or that store telemetry data there. To make it even more simple to developers, the service monitoring is able to automatically detect many types of managed services and supports predefined <em>availability</em> and <em>latency</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_level_indicator"><strong>SLI</strong></a> definitions for them.<br>When you define a new SLO you are prompted to select a predefined SLI or to define your own.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/757/0*78QiebDtoB3PG1KF.png" /></figure><p>While it is convenient to use predefined SLIs you aren’t provided with information about SLI definitions. If you already defined an SLO using one of predefined SLIs, you can get its detailed description using the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/services.serviceLevelObjectives/get"><strong>services.serviceLevelObjectives.get</strong></a> API. For example, the following command returns JSON payload that describes the SLO named availability_slo of the frontend service that was defined using the predefined availability SLI:</p><pre>curl -X GET \<br>https://monitoring.googleapis.com/v3/projects/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/\<br>services/frontend/\<br>serviceLevelObjectives/frontend-availability-slo?view=EXPLICIT \<br>-H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)&quot; \<br>-H &quot;Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8&quot;</pre><p>This example uses gcloud <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud"><strong>CLI</strong></a> and the environment variable GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT. This variable is automatically set by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/launching-cloud-shell"><strong>Cloud Shell</strong></a>. However, if you run this command in your shell, you will need to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk"><strong>install</strong></a> gcloud, then to authenticate vs Google Cloud and to set up the GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT environment variable to the project ID where your SLO is defined. The following paragraphs describe predefined SLIs to enable you to make an educated choice next time you use them.</p><h3>Managed (auto-detected) services</h3><p>The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/slo-monitoring/api/using-api#managing-services"><strong>managed services</strong></a> generate metrics that are further used to calculate predefined SLIs. The service monitoring automatically detects these managed services or the user can provision them manually. As long as the service is defined as one of the basic services and uses one of the following types, it can leverage the predefined SLIs.</p><ul><li>APP_ENGINE – Every <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/testing-and-deploying-your-app"><strong>deployed application</strong></a> is considered a service. This service can be monitored using multiple ways including SLOs.</li><li>ISTIO_CANONICAL_SERVICE – When vanilla Istio is configured to ingest its metrics to Cloud Monitoring, its services are auto-detected as Istio canonical services. GKE workloads that leverage the managed version of Istio (aka <a href="https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh"><strong>ASM</strong></a>) do not use this type.</li><li>CLUSTER_ISTIO – Services that run on GKE with ASM are identified as Cluster Istio services. Note that since ASM supports Kubernetes clusters on Azure and AWS you can implement service monitoring for these clusters as well.</li><li>CLOUD_RUN – Cloud Run <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/overview/what-is-cloud-run#services"><strong>services</strong></a> are auto-detected using this type. Important to remember that service monitoring does not support Cloud Run jobs.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>NOTE:</strong> Not all services that Service monitoring automatically detects, have predefined SLIs. For example, services of types GKE_SERVICE or GKE_WORKLOAD do not have predefined SLIs (because they do not ingest any metrics to Google Cloud).</blockquote><h3>Predefined SLIs</h3><p>All predefined SLIs are measured in % and calculated based on the well known formula of</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/321/0*SFvP6lTuqqsst9Qp.jpg" /></figure><p>The predefined SLIs use a <strong>resource type</strong> and a <strong>metric</strong> to get the event data. The <strong>availability metric</strong> is used to get availability events and the <strong>latency metric</strong> is used to get latency events. From all metric data the good events are derived using a <strong>good service filter</strong> and valid events — using the union of <strong>good service filter</strong> <em>AND</em> <strong>bad service filter</strong>. The filters are built using metric labels and leverage the fact that both availability and latency metrics have the same set of labels. You can use the following MQL query to see the <em>valid events</em>:</p><pre>fetch %%resource%%<br>| metric &#39;%%metric%%&#39;<br>| filter (%%good_service_filter%%) || (%%bad_service_filter%%)</pre><p>And this MQL query to see the <em>good events</em>:</p><pre>fetch %%resource%%<br>| metric &#39;%%metric%%&#39;<br>| filter %%good_service_filter%%</pre><blockquote><strong>NOTE:</strong> You will have to replace values enclosed with double percentage (%%) with the actual values of the predefined SLIs.</blockquote><h3>AppEngine service</h3><p>Detects both standard and flexible AppEngine services.</p><p><strong>Resource type</strong>: gae_app</p><p><strong>Availability metric</strong>: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#appengine/http/server/response_count"><strong>appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_count</strong></a></p><p><strong>Latency metric</strong>: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#appengine/http/server/response_latencies"><strong>appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies</strong></a></p><p><strong>Good service filter</strong>:</p><pre>resource.module_id = &#39;MODULE_ID&#39; &amp;&amp;<br>metric.response_code &gt;= 200 &amp;&amp; metric.response_code &lt;= 299</pre><blockquote><strong>NOTE:</strong> MODULE_ID should be replaced with the actual AppEngine service/module name.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>GCP Cross-region internal application load balancer : why and how</h3><p>Context :</p><p>A Google Cloud<strong><em> internal Application Load Balancer</em></strong> is a proxy-based layer 7 load balancer that enables you to run and scale your services behind a single internal IP address. The internal Application Load Balancer distributes HTTP and HTTPS traffic to backends hosted on a variety of Google Cloud platforms such as Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and Cloud Run. This load balancer is available in 2 flavors :</p><ol><li>Regional internal application load balancer</li><li>Cross-regional internal application load balancer</li></ol><p>The cross-region internal application load balancer enables you to load balance traffic to backend services that are globally distributed, including traffic management that ensures traffic is directed to the closest backend.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/911/0*1RXP-_RyrxR_ngJ6" /></figure><p>The idea of this blog post is to see how cross-regional internal application load balancer is deployed and its use-cases under steady state and failover situations.</p><p>Failover may fall in 2 categories : (a) failover of a regional backend (b) failover of iLB frontend</p><ul><li>Failover of Frontend: When the proxy tasks in a region (where the forwarding rule is configured) fail. Failover to a forwarding rule in a different region is done using a DNS failover policy.</li><li>Failover of Backend: When all of the backends (e.g. VM instances) in a region fail, the load balancer automatically chooses healthy, available backends in the next closest region.</li></ul><h3>Topology</h3><p>In the test topology used in this blog , I had one VPC with subnets in 2 regions : asia-south1 ( Mumbai) and asia-south2 ( Delhi ) . The CIDR used in each subnet is shown in the topology diagram below . These 2 subnets host the instance groups where web application servers are hosted.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*XsF-O-_jjjgd-dLW" /></figure><p>As a next step ( and a mandatory step ) for setting up cross regional internal application load balancer , it is necessary to reserve PROXY subnet for each region in context . In my example , I have reserved 2 proxy subnets ( one each for asia-south1 and asis-south2 )</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/742/0*jCHDHuwtb6bpguLO" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*tZyjIMJGJNJCbZ9h" /></figure><p>Setup Load balancer : Lets break this in 3 simple parts</p><ol><li>Front end setup</li><li>Backend setup</li><li>Routing rules</li></ol><p><strong>Front End :</strong> Create one front end per region . You may choose the protocol as HTTP or HTTPs for the front end . In our case , we had following configured for the front end</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*oRK2qM9x-wbnZ3K4" /></figure><p><strong>Backend</strong></p><p>Created one backend service</p><p>In this backend service → I created 2 backends . One for each regional instance group.In my case , each backend consist of instance groups running web server.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*fx1m5yQriei4epnU" /></figure><p>Sample output of load balancer backend service</p><pre>$ gcloud compute backend-services describe cross-region-bserv-for-ilb --global<br>affinityCookieTtlSec: 0<br>backends:<br>- balancingMode: UTILIZATION<br>  capacityScaler: 1.0<br>  group: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/gm-test-337806/zones/asia-south1-c/instanceGroups/lb-test-mumbai-umig<br>  maxRatePerInstance: 100.0<br>  maxUtilization: 0.8<br>- balancingMode: UTILIZATION<br>  capacityScaler: 1.0<br>  group: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/gm-test-337806/zones/asia-south2-a/instanceGroups/lb-test-delhi-01<br>  maxRatePerInstance: 100.0<br>  maxUtilization: 0.8<br>connectionDraining:<br>  drainingTimeoutSec: 300<br>creationTimestamp: &#39;2024-04-27T21:04:05.231-07:00&#39;<br>description: &#39;&#39;<br>fingerprint: WRypjLxKN0M=<br>healthChecks:<br>- https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/gm-test-337806/global/healthChecks/auto-health<br>id: &#39;1322192009993155674&#39;<br>kind: compute#backendService<br>loadBalancingScheme: INTERNAL_MANAGED<br>localityLbPolicy: ROUND_ROBIN<br>logConfig:<br>  enable: false<br>  optionalMode: EXCLUDE_ALL_OPTIONAL<br>name: cross-region-bserv-for-ilb<br>port: 80<br>portName: lb-test-mumbai-http<br>protocol: HTTP<br>selfLink: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/gm-test-337806/global/backendServices/cross-region-bserv-for-ilb<br>sessionAffinity: NONE<br>timeoutSec: 30<br>usedBy:<br>- reference: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/gm-test-337806/global/urlMaps/cross-regional-internal-layer7</pre><h3>TEST # 1</h3><p>Client sending traffic to regional front-end :In this test , we assumed that regional clients will send traffic to respective iLB front end ; i.e Mumbai client sent traffic to ilB front end in Mumbai (asia-south1) and Delhi client sent requests to Delhi (asia-south2) front end</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*JQ_eqgNPJ7FLA4Km" /></figure><p>Test initiated from TEST-CLIENT-2 (Delhi region)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nsf8Ldi_ft8FSE8Ard0sSA.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wNpJFYX8rVZbXdpRiAJxVA.png" /></figure><p>This worked as expected . Customer relied on making separate entries in DNS for each front end and this was used by respective clients in their application access method. The load balancer served traffic from closest healthy backend available.</p><h3>TEST # 2</h3><p>Client sending traffic to cross-regional front-end : This is continuation of test case 1 , where the requirement is to access a workload in a cross-region ; i.e. client in asia-south1 (Mumbai) trying to access workload in asia-south2 by accessing front end name / IP of layer7 iLB in asia-south2 region</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*5xlcWKelOS-SYrhF" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4gFU4GGLPR868OnKlK-chg.png" /></figure><p>Hence , once the requests land on a iLB frontend , it tries to route it to a healthy backend nearest to it</p><h3>TEST # 3</h3><p>Failover Scenario : In this case , let’s assume service in asia-south2 failed ( Or all VMs down ) . For simulation in my setup , I removed the backend in Delhi region from the iLB backend service configuration.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*5V3H5pYuX7hmvtDc" /></figure><p>Lets see the results</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NPgfHr0OtxKuAAAPfwG98Q.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zz7jqMMh8ezDuhxHai22CQ.png" /></figure><p>Hence , as expected , in event of no healthy backend , the iLB will redirect the traffic to healthy backends in next closest region.</p><h3>TEST # 4</h3><p>Combining Cross region ILB functionality with GCP CLOUD DNS GEO routing POLICY</p><p>This is most interesting usecase . Here ; instead of using separate domain names for application hosted in asia-south1 / asia-south2, the customer created a domain name called “<a href="http://application.myapp.com">application.myapp.com</a>”. In addition to this , customer created a GEO routing policy specifying region as ‘asia-south1’ resolve to 10.10.152.10 [ load balancer front end in asia-south1 ] and asia-south2 resolve ot 10.10.151.11 [ load balancer front end in asia-south1 ] . Sample DNS configuration is as follows -</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*u81MR6Lacpz10SnG" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eNvPTqsf_g-1OAKE" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A-AcPldmLJwaN4B4R8RFHQ.png" /></figure><p>When client attempted to access the app behind<strong> </strong><a href="http://application.myapp.com">application.myapp.com</a><strong> </strong>; the response came from the nearby region</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*w1m9uOolhhvormxUGHsUXg.png" /></figure><p>BACKEND FAILOVER ( no healthy backend in one of region )</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*QST9fnimdqhQMzGi" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0hChkmK94Q9SMUc8Qdhq9w.png" /></figure><p>Again , as expected , no matter which frontend IP the query lands , iLB send the request to nearby healthy backend. For example , if client in Delhi region sends request to front-end in Delhi-region of iLB , this will be routed to next near healthy backend ( which is Mumbai in my setup )</p><h3>TEST # 5</h3><p>This test has to do with failover of proxy task in a given region . This is where Failover Policy of Cloud DNS can come handy.</p><p>In this setup , customer needs to serve everything from Asia-south1 application instance and if this is not available / reachable ; asia-south2 instance shall be considered .</p><p>Lets look at Cloud DNS Failover Policy</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7fuPsVppPUXHl6cxa31kaA.png" /></figure><p>This simply means that clients will resolve to iLB frontend IP address in Asia-south1 ( 10.10.152.10 ) and if this isnt reachable ; clients in both regions will resolve app1.myapp.com to iLB front-end IP in asia-south2 ( 10.10.151.12 )</p><p>Hence in steady state the setup will work like follows</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sQ5ubMo1PNetYpbPngKuUQ.png" /></figure><p>However in case of Front end fail , the setup will work like following</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*93E6z75MsUUVRDhMInYsRw.png" /></figure><p>Useful URLs</p><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/l7-internal/setting-up-l7-cross-reg-internal">Setup cross-regional internal L7 load balancer</a></p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This is to inform readers that the views, thoughts, and opinions expressed in the text belong solely to the author, and not necessarily to the author’s employer, organization, committee or other group or individual.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f3a33226d690" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/gcp-cross-region-internal-application-load-balancer-why-and-how-f3a33226d690">GCP Cross-region internal application load balancer : why and how</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud">Google Cloud - Community</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learn how to quickly create a chatbot over your API using Vertex AI Extensions. No coding or training required. Interact with your API seamlessly through a chat interface. Read more to explore the possibilities!</p><h3>What is API?</h3><p>An API (Application Programming Interface) serves as a bridge between various software programs. It defines a set of rules and requirements that apps may follow to interact with one another.</p><h3>What is Chatbot?</h3><p>A software program that simulates human-user conversations. Chatbots are frequently used in messaging apps, websites, and customer service to offer information or do tasks.</p><p><strong>Traditionally</strong>, a Chatbot is trained on intents to understand which data to be fetched, what all parameters are required and how to extract them from the prompt given by user and at the end format the API response for easy reading. This will improve readability for the user.</p><h4><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></h4><p>If any changes are made to API, like taking in a new parameter, change in the response from API, in that case, we will have to make the changes in the chatbot as well to handle the new changes. Similarly, if a new API is added, then the whole process of creating intent, extracting parameters, prettifying API response.</p><h4><strong>Solution:</strong></h4><p>Using Extension in Vertex AI, to build Chatbots over your API. How to do it?? Just follow the steps below!!</p><blockquote><strong>Disclaimer: Extensions in Vertex AI is still in PREVIEW. It </strong>Is under development and gaining functionalities.</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NzBLlx8ssBksQoAYY9f9Yg.jpeg" /><figcaption>AI Generated by SDXL 1.0</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>How to Build a Chatbot over your API?</strong></h4><ol><li>Create a sample <a href="https://swagger.io/docs/specification/basic-structure/"><strong><em>OpenAPI specification file</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong>(only yaml file supported till now). I have used a sample file from <a href="https://petstore.swagger.io/#/"><strong>swagger</strong></a><strong> </strong>and trimmed down the file to only include API related to pets.</li><li>Login to Google cloud console, and navigate to <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/extensions"><strong>Extensions in Vertex AI</strong></a>. Click on “Create Extension”</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/967/1*XhAbnI0WjAi2LwiGO9NqRg.png" /></figure><p>3. Enter the name that you want to give to the extension, we have given name as “pet_store”. Then enter any description that you want and in the Extension Type, Click on <strong>“Custom”. </strong><em>(For other 2 Extension Types stay tuned and follow, I am going to soon write about them)</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/736/1*n4HJxa0_rimgxzJN0EoN5w.png" /></figure><p>4. Once you select Custom Extension Type, you will get a below form, just enter details according to your API. In the OpenAPI Spec file section, upload you YAML file created in STEP 1.</p><p>If there are no error, you would get the below confirmation as “No errors detected”. Along with that it will also list down all the APIs that are present in the YAML file. (as seen in the below image). For this demo, with will select “No Authentication”, but if your application requires authentication you can set that up in the “Authentication” dropdown.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/620/1*a1AYbiYTqah3RI1vpg6tGg.png" /></figure><p>5. Once the extension is created you would see a screen like shown below. This shows that your Chatbot is ready and you can query it in the below text box. Let us try some examples and check.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VTDjZCc7YoZULPsMZN79Cw.png" /></figure><h4>Testing the Chatbot:</h4><ol><li>Lets try to create a new pet in our pet store. I just put the query as “add a pet” and it was quickly able to understand what are the required parameters to create a pet. So the bot asked me one by one to enter the name and then the id for our new pet. Once it got all the required information, it created the pet.</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Xj_zCG3FaOXULUAbx4gNlw.jpeg" /></figure><p>2. Let’s try to get the information for our newly created pet. When I ask “get pet”, it understood that there is not API to get all pets and hence asked me for an id. Once the id is entered, the chatbot was able to fetch the information for the pet we just now created.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aY_yRDGdq3PUsFbJ7COFOw.jpeg" /></figure><p>3. Let’s add one more pet. When queried for “add a pet”, it asked for the name, then id and then finally the status. Notice how it gave me the options for status (available, pending or sold). This is because these are the options mentioned in the YAML file for the status field.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GAioFu8z194NXUT8eqYVnA.jpeg" /></figure><p>4. Let’s try to get the new pet that we created. The Chatbot gets the complete information when the id is entered.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AqY7U5u3i0Fqz3Kolsnd9Q.jpeg" /></figure><p>5. Now let us try to update the pet and see if the bot is able to handle it. So when I query “update pet”, it asks for the id, and then asks what field i need to update, is it name or status. So when I enter “status is sold”, it updates that and gives the response for the successful status update.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vxeEJ46eOZUPZC9R70CPIg.jpeg" /></figure><p>6. To be actually sure if the value is updated in backend or not, I tried to get the pet infomation. But this time, in the first query itself i have the id and did a query as “get pet 123”. This time the Chatbot got the id and did not ask again for the id. In the very next step, it has come back with the response saying the pet with id 123 is sold.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1013/1*XnLPpJCCto9yMK2FT4YuXg.jpeg" /></figure><p>7. Finally, lets now try to delete the pet. When I query “delete pet”, the Chatbot asks me for the id, and when the id is entered it deletes that entry for pet with id 123.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1010/1*4opSTPvFIBWlGFsfxmjObg.jpeg" /></figure><p>As seen above, We were able to interact with our API, perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) through the Chatbot which required no training, no coding!!</p><h3>Opportunities for improvement<strong>:</strong></h3><ol><li>It only supports Content Type with “application/JSON” for input and output.</li><li>Currently it does not work with query parameters.</li><li>There should be an option to update the YAML file once uploaded. Currently to update the YAML, you would have to delete the old Extension and create a new one.</li><li>Currently it only supports calling the Chatbot through REST API or through GCP console. It would be great to have it integrated in the Vertex AI SDK.</li></ol><h3>Conclusions:</h3><ol><li>It have become very easy to create a Chatbot over your APIs.</li><li>You won’t have to train the Chatbot again once new APIs are added.</li><li>You won’t have to manage the context and parameter values given by the user.</li></ol><h3>If you enjoyed this post, give it a clap! 👏 👏</h3><h3>Interested in similar content?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*K83VzvK4cZWYiMUiLK9A2w.png" /></figure><h3>Intro</h3><p>I was fighting recently with approach for granting time-based access to my organization. I didn’t wanted to use 3rd party solution like CyberArk (which is super great). I wanted to utilize something cloud native, provided by vendor. I found open-community project called “Just-in-time”. That was fantastic approach at that time. But today I’ve discovered that Google Cloud pushed into Pre-GA phase service called Privileged Access Manager (PAM)</p><p>➡️ More info about JIT <a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/manage-just-in-time-privileged-access-to-project">here</a></p><h3>Short info about PAM</h3><p>Privileged Access Manager (PAM) is a security solution designed to manage, monitor, and secure access to privileged accounts within an organization’s IT infrastructure. These privileged accounts typically have elevated permissions and access to sensitive resources, making them a prime target for cyber attackers.</p><p>You can use PAM in following situations:</p><ul><li>As a general practice, instead of permanently granting roles. Combined with approvals and justifications, this lets you manage access to sensitive resources without resorting to permanently over-permissioned principals. You can also use PAM to audit when granted roles were active for a principal, what resources were accessible during that time, what the justification was for that access, and who approved the access.</li><li>For select emergency responders, to allow them to perform critical tasks without having to wait for approval. You can require justifications for additional context on why the emergency access is needed.</li><li>For service accounts, to only grant them roles when they need the roles to perform an automated task.</li><li>For contractors, to allow temporary access to resources during business hours that requires approvals and justifications.</li></ul><h3>How to enable PAM</h3><p>PAM can be configured at the organization, folder, or project level. You need also mandatory permissions to do that, so before you start:</p><p>Grant you the following IAM roles on the organization, folder, or project:</p><ul><li>To create, update, and delete entitlements: Privileged Access Manager Admin (roles/privilegedaccessmanager.admin). Additionally, either Folder IAM Admin (roles/resourcemanager.folderIamAdmin), Project IAM Admin (roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin), or Security Admin (roles/iam.securityAdmin)</li><li>To view entitlements and grants: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#privilegedaccessmanager.viewer">Privileged Access Manager Viewer </a>(roles/privilegedaccessmanager.viewer)</li><li>To view audit logs: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#logs.viewer">Logs Viewer </a>(roles/logs.viewer)</li></ul><p>The following permissions are required to work with entitlements and grants:</p><ul><li>To enable PAM at the organization, folder, or project scope:</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.locations.checkOnboardingStatus</li><li>resourcemanager.organizations.get</li><li>resourcemanager.organizations.getIamPolicy</li><li>resourcemanager.organizations.setIamPolicy</li><li>resourcemanager.folders.get</li><li>resourcemanager.folders.getIamPolicy</li><li>resourcemanager.folders.setIamPolicy</li><li>resourcemanager.projects.get</li><li>resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy</li><li>resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy</li><li>To manage entitlements and grants:</li><li>resourcemanager.folders.get</li><li>resourcemanager.organizations.get</li><li>resourcemanager.projects.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.create</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.delete</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.list</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.setIamPolicy</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.grants.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.grants.list</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.grants.revoke</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.locations.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.locations.list</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.operations.delete</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.operations.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.operations.list</li><li>To view entitlements and grants:</li><li>resourcemanager.folders.get</li><li>resourcemanager.organizations.get</li><li>resourcemanager.projects.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.list</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.grants.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.grants.list</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.locations.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.locations.list</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.operations.get</li><li>privilegedaccessmanager.operations.list</li><li>To view audit logs: logging.logEntries.list</li></ul><p>You might also be able to get these permissions with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles">custom roles</a> or other <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles">predefined roles</a>.</p><p>➡️ More info about managing accesses can be found <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access">here</a></p><p>Once granted, complete following steps to enable PAM:</p><ol><li>Go to the <strong>Privileged Access Manager</strong> page.</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/637/1*3guT0c9zLqp8yYEBwBY5Cw.png" /><figcaption>Fig1.

Traditionally, this process is manual and time-consuming, especially for functions with numerous test cases. Gemini 1.5 API’s potential to streamline development by automating input generation is explored through applying reverse engineering techniques to Google Apps Script samples.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>With the release of Gemini 1.5 API, users gained the ability to process more complex data, opening doors for various application developments. This report explores the potential of using Gemini 1.5 API in conjunction with Google Apps Script to achieve reverse engineering for script development and improvement.</p><p>Traditionally, script development involves manually crafting sample input values. This process can be time-consuming, especially when creating functions or testing code retrieved from online resources like Stack Overflow. Each function might require numerous test cases, and manually generating these inputs can be a bottleneck.</p><p>Gemini 1.5 API offers a potential solution by automating sample input value creation. This could significantly reduce development time and effort. This report investigates this possibility by applying reverse engineering techniques to various Google Apps Script samples using Gemini 1.5 API.</p><p>Here, we will explore how Gemini 1.5 API can be used to automate sample input value generation for reverse engineering scripts written in Google Apps Script.</p><h3>Usage</h3><p>In order to test this script, please do the following flow.</p><h3>1. Create an API key</h3><p>Please access <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key">https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key</a> and create your API key. At that time, please enable Generative Language API at the API console. This API key is used for this sample script.</p><p>This official document can be also seen. <a href="https://ai.google.dev/">Ref</a>.</p><h3>2. Create a Google Apps Script project</h3><p>In this report, Google Apps Script is used. Of course, the method introducing this report can be also used in other languages.</p><p>Here, in order to test the following sample scripts, please create a standalone Google Apps Script project. Of course, this script can be also used with the container-bound script.</p><p>And, please open the script editor of the Google Apps Script project.</p><h3>3. Install Google Apps Script library</h3><p>In order to easily access Gemini API, I created a Google Apps Script library <a href="https://github.com/tanaikech/GeminiWithFiles">GeminiWithFiles</a>. In the following sample scripts, this library is used. So, please install it. You can see how to install it at <a href="https://github.com/tanaikech/GeminiWithFiles?tab=readme-ov-file#1-use-geminiwithfiles-as-a-google-apps-script-library">here</a>.</p><h3>4.

In this example, all functions can be executed in a single API call. When I ran this script, it returned a total of 2,880 tokens.</p><p>The sample first creates input values using Gemini. To test these values, the script then uses them with the function implemented in Google Apps Script. Finally, both the input and output values are printed.</p><p>JSON schema is employed here to generate content.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Using Google’s Gemini Function Calling to Fetch Real-Time Company News and Insights from External APIs</h3><p>In today’s fast-paced financial markets, professional and seasoned investors are constantly on the lookout for efficient ways to stay ahead. The sheer volume of financial data available can be overwhelming, but powerful generative models such as the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/overview">Gemini model in Vertex AI</a> along with tool frameworks like <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/function-calling">Function Calling in Gemini</a> offer a promising solution. These tool frameworks not only automate the process of gathering financial insights but also revolutionizes the way investors can use generative models to interact with market data.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Function Calling is a native framework in Gemini that enables the generative model to call specific functions and perform tasks based on user prompts. It allows you to get output from the Gemini model in a structured way, trigger function calls that process data, retrieve information from external sources, or execute operations via API calls. This approach allows you to build AI agents that can perform complex workflows and opens up new possibilities for automation.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vOZ_3hOAcKSo2wUaYNTqRw.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DN0M1Sim-LMSCF892XZZOA.png" /></figure><p>When using Function Calling in Gemini, you can still communicate with Gemini through natural language prompts, which Gemini then transforms into structured data outputs. This interaction provides a flexible way to convert natural language into API calls that access real-time information from external APIs and quickly generate insights. Let’s dive into a use case that illustrates how this technology can streamline news and financial data analysis of various companies.</p><h3>The Investor’s Challenge</h3><p>Meet Jane! She’s a busy investor who’s always on the lookout for the latest market trends and financial news. She needs information quickly and accurately, but sifting through endless articles and reports is time-consuming.</p><p>Jane’s daily routine involves analyzing a flood of financial reports and market data to identify investment opportunities. By relying solely on Gemini, she faces significant challenges like frozen training data, making it difficult to access the latest market trends. Inconsistent responses further hinder her analysis, as the model struggles to provide accurate and relevant information consistently. Additionally, the limited functionality of generative models without function and tool framework prevents Jane from seamlessly integrating real-time data and executing complex financial calculations, leaving her with a fragmented and inefficient workflow.</p><h3>Discovering the Solution: Gemini Function Calling</h3><p>The breakthrough came when Jane discovered Function Calling in Gemini. This framework uses native functionality in the Gemini model to translate natural language into structured data that we can use to help the generative model integrate with external data sources and fetch tailored financial and company insights. It’s not just about speed; it’s about the relevance and precision of the information that we’re sending to the Gemini model to augment the knowledge it was trained on with real-time information from external systems.</p><p><strong>How Jane Uses Gemini Function Calling</strong></p><p>Here’s a look at how Jane uses Function Calling in Gemini to provide functions as tools to enhance her data analysis:</p><p><strong><em>Function Declaration</em></strong></p><pre>get_company_overview_func = FunctionDeclaration(<br>    name=&quot;get_company_overview&quot;,<br>    description=&quot;This function returns the company information, financial ratios, and other key metrics for the equity specified. Data is generally refreshed on the same day a company reports its latest earnings and financials.&quot;,<br>    parameters={<br>        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,<br>        &quot;properties&quot;: {&quot;ticker&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The symbol of the ticker of your choice. For example: symbol=IBM&quot;}},<br>    },<br>)</pre><p>In this code snippet, Jane defines a function called get_company_overview. This function is designed to fetch essential company information, financial ratios, and key metrics for a specific stock ticker. The description provides a clear explanation of the function&#39;s purpose, while the parameters specify the required input (the stock ticker symbol).</p><p><strong><em>Prompt</em></strong></p><pre>Give me the company overview of Google?</pre><p>Jane poses a simple question to Gemini, requesting an overview of Google’s company information.</p><p><strong><em>API Call</em></strong></p><pre>def get_company_overview_from_api(content):<br>    url = f&#39;https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=OVERVIEW&amp;symbol={content[&quot;ticker&quot;]}&amp;apikey=INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY&#39;<br>    api_response = requests.get(url)  # Get the JSON response from the external news sentiment API<br>    return api_response.text</pre><p>Behind the scenes, Gemini recognizes the intent of Jane’s query and triggers the get_company_overview function. This function, in turn, constructs a URL to query the Alpha Vantage API, replacing the placeholder {content[&quot;ticker&quot;]} with &quot;GOOG&quot; (the ticker symbol for Google). The API call fetches the relevant company data in JSON format.</p><p><strong><em>Gemini Response</em></strong></p><pre>## Google&#39;s Company Overview:<br>* **Alphabet Inc Class C (GOOG)** is a multinational technology conglomerate headquartered in Mountain View, California.<br>* It&#39;s the parent company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries.<br>* As of March 31, 2024, it boasts a market capitalization of over $2 trillion.<br>* Key financial ratios:<br>    * P/E Ratio: 25.39<br>    * PEG Ratio: 1.659<br>    * Price/Book Ratio: 6.99<br>* Recent performance:<br>    * Quarterly earnings growth year-over-year: 0.609<br>    * Quarterly revenue growth year-over-year: 0.154</pre><p>Gemini processes the JSON data received from the API and crafts a concise summary in natural language. This summary highlights key aspects of Google’s company overview, including its full name, market capitalization, financial ratios, and recent performance metrics.</p><p>As demonstrated in this example, Gemini Function Calling streamlines the process of accessing company information. By simply asking a question, Jane can instantly receive a comprehensive overview of Google’s financial standing, saving her valuable time and effort.</p><p><strong>Impact and Advancements</strong></p><p>Integrating Gemini Function Calling has significantly reduced the time Jane spends on company research, allowing her to focus more on strategic analysis and less on operational tasks. Since Jane was also able to build a web app and share it with her team, the tool’s efficiency in delivering real-time, actionable insights has notably improved her team’s responsiveness to market changes.</p><p><strong>Extend the Functionality</strong></p><p>You can take the above example and extend it to serve your own needs, including integrating different data sources or defining additional functions that the Gemini model can use as tools at runtime. These improvements could further refine data accuracy and expand its utility across different industries.</p><h3>Explore the Code</h3><p>If you’re interested in exploring Gemini Function Calling further, visit the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/gemini/function-calling/use_case_company_news_and_insights.ipynb">GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai</a> code repository on GitHub to view and run the sample notebook.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Function Calling in Gemini offers a powerful way for generative models to interact with external systems and APIs to automate complex tasks. By integrating with external APIs, you can quickly retrieve the latest financial news and stock information, enabling faster and more informed decision-making.</p><p>Beyond mere automation, Function Calling ensures consistent and structured responses - eliminating the ambiguity and inconsistencies often associated with generative models. Developers gain full control in tailoring functions to specific financial tasks, such as real-time portfolio analysis or risk assessment. This powerful feature also augments generative models with real-time information from diverse sources, including databases, document repositories, and any other system accessible via an API.</p><p>Whether you’re a financial analyst, data scientist, or technology enthusiast, this approach can significantly streamline your workflow, improve accuracy, and unlock new possibilities in the way you access and process financial data.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d11b2da565e3" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/using-googles-gemini-function-calling-to-fetch-real-time-company-news-and-insights-from-external-d11b2da565e3">Using Google’s Gemini Function Calling to Fetch Real-Time Company News and Insights from External…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud">Google Cloud - Community</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Scale Data Quality effortlessly on Google Cloud: Building a federated DQ framework empowered by Dataplex AutoDQ and BigQuery</h3><p>The realm of data management is rapidly evolving, and enterprises are grappling with the challenge of ensuring data quality at scale. Data quality is the cornerstone of reliable information, minimizing data incidents, and ensuring regulatory compliance. The Data Mesh approach, a recently adopted paradigm in data management, emphasizes uniform data quality as a crucial factor for success. However, many organizations struggle with consistent data quality due to siloed data, fragmented implementation, and a lack of self-service infrastructure which often impede the implementation of data quality at scale.</p><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/auto-data-quality-overview">Dataplex AutoDQ</a>, addresses these challenges by offering a comprehensive solution that integrates with Google Cloud tools like BigQuery and other services, providing a centralized, scalable, and self-service data quality framework. BigQuery’s scalable storage and federation capability which helps connect with external data sources are conducive to the framework. Fig.1 below outlines comprehensive Auto DQ capabilities and features.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rwBpsi9r6cQ1mqTi" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*OLDPDid1jJYvnUV3" /><figcaption>Fig 1: Dataplex Auto DQ Features</figcaption></figure><p>This aforementioned framework enables the definition of data quality objectives and measurable methodologies for each domain and offers the following key features:</p><ul><li><strong>Centralized Management:</strong> Consistent data quality standards and measurement methodologies are established for the organization.</li><li><strong>Self-Service Capabilities:</strong> Teams can independently define and manage their data quality processes and metrics. This eliminates the need for each team to maintain its own infrastructure or processes for data quality management.</li><li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The framework can accommodate growth and the integration of new data sources.</li></ul><p>In this article, we will delve into the technical aspects of the federated and scalable data quality framework empowered by Dataplex Auto DQ and BQ in conjunction with other Google cloud services.</p><h3>The Federated DQ Framework: The Balance is a must</h3><p>A federated DQ framework can provide a solution by empowering organizations to manage DQ in a centralized and consistent manner, while still allowing for domain-specific autonomy.</p><p>A key aspect of a federated DQ framework is the balance between centralization and autonomy. On the one hand, it is important to have centralized infrastructure and service to ensure consistency and prevent data quality silos. On the other hand, it is also important to empower domain teams with the autonomy to define and manage DQ assessments specific to their domain.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*dKVjOMs4hVsdV2-i" /><figcaption>Fig 2: Federated DQ Framework Conceptual Architecture</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Centralized Infrastructure and Service</strong></p><p>The centralized infrastructure and service should provide core DQaaS functionalities such as: Data Profiling and analysis, Data Cleansing and transformation, Data Quality monitoring and reporting. This centralized infrastructure should be managed by a dedicated data quality team that is responsible for setting and enforcing data quality standards across the organization.</p><p><strong>Domain-Owned Data Assessments</strong></p><p>Domain teams should be empowered to define and manage DQ assessments specific to their domain. This allows them to tailor DQ rules to their unique needs while still adhering to overall data quality standards. The Domain team should also be responsible for monitoring and remediating data quality issues and will be measured across those KPIs.</p><p><strong>Why This Balance Matters</strong></p><p>Inconsistency in data quality across domains can cripple effective data management and hinder organizational goals. A centralized yet democratized Data Quality Framework addresses this by:</p><ul><li>Establishing Common Data Quality Metrics</li><li>Streamlining Data Quality Management</li><li>Supporting Federated Rule Management</li><li>Ensuring Scalability and Collaboration</li><li>AI assistance for DQ rules recommendation and binding</li></ul><p>This balanced approach entrusts domain teams with ownership while mitigating administrative burdens and infrastructure complexities while ensuring consistent data quality throughout the organization.</p><h3>The Federated DQ Framework: Reference Architecture</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*KTcGTpZRM1eKdcB5" /><figcaption>Fig 3: Federated DQ Framework Technical Reference Architecture</figcaption></figure><p>Fig 3 illustrates the technical end-to-end architecture of the federated Data Quality framework and incorporates the following components:</p><ol><li><strong>Defining/Developing DQ Rules </strong>Dataplex provides multiple interfaces to help data product owners define and modify data quality (DQ) rules. DQ rules can be specified using JSON or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/use-auto-data-quality#create-scan-using-gcloud">YAML files</a>, enabling users to focus on formalizing validation rules without writing code. Users can also define reusable rules based on a standard template.Currently, BigQuery Machine Learning (BQML) models have the ability to be embedded within data quality (DQ) rules. For instance, anomaly detection BQML models can be effortlessly integrated into DQ rules. Additionally, the reusability of rules can be achieved through the definition of common rules via user-defined functions (UDFs). AI will assist in making advanced rule recommendations in the future. Learn more about rule definitions <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/auto-data-quality-overview#rule-definition">here</a>.</li><li><strong>Review &amp; Approval </strong>Data stewards ensure data quality (DQ) rules meet organizational requirements, especially for critical and sensitive data elements. They verify the presence of required DQ rules and ensure proper definition and adherence to best practices. AI can assist with validation in the future. Existing review and approval processes can be leveraged for this purpose.</li><li><strong>DQ-as-a-Code </strong>Data quality configurations can be managed as code using Terraform, GitHub, and Cloud Build. This enables version control and seamless transfer of rules between environments.<strong> </strong>You can learn more about it <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/manage-data-quality-rules-as-code">here</a>.</li><li><strong>Data Store</strong> Automatic Data Quality (DQ) is supported for BigQuery tables, views, BigLake, and external tables created on Google Cloud Storage (GCS) data. The extensive capabilities of BigQuery as a data repository allow it to efficiently connect to external data sources, making data movement unnecessary and thus facilitating seamless data interoperability. Data Quality also facilitates the execution of data quality rules on various data storage formats, such as Parquet, Avro, Iceberg, and others, through BigLake.</li><li><strong>Orchestration</strong> You can schedule data quality checks through the serverless scheduler in Dataplex, or use the Dataplex API through external schedulers like Cloud Composer for pipeline integration. The composer DAG, which can be created as part of the framework, is in charge of orchestrating the data quality execution and then tagging workflow based on the schedule/dependency details supplied by the data product owner. Incorporating a Dataplex DQ job as a component of your data pipelines is made simpler by the ease with which a data engineering job can be an upstream or downstream dependency. Remember that composer can be used as a federated component, allowing us to use either a central operations composer instance or a domain-specific composer instance.</li><li><strong>Data Quality execution engine</strong> Dataplex DQ engines execute data quality rules against data in Google Cloud Storage and BigQuery(extend to other data sources through federation), requiring no infrastructure setup. They are fully managed, serverless, and support incremental checks.</li><li><strong>Incident management &amp; Actions</strong> Dataplex DQ logs are forwarded to cloud logging. Failed logs can be monitored by cloud monitoring. The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/use-auto-data-quality#set-alerts">notification channel alerts </a>relevant parties through emails, pagers, slack, or web hooks. Additional actions such as bug filing and assignment can be done too. Learn more about monitoring and alerting <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/auto-data-quality-overview#monitoring-and-alerting">here</a>.</li><li><strong>Analysis &amp; reporting</strong> Data quality results, generated by the Data Quality service, can be <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/use-auto-data-quality#table-schema">published to BigQuery </a>directly or extracted using the API. This enables the organization to democratize this data, making it available for programmatic reporting and further analysis, such as time series. Additionally, column and row level security controls can be implemented at the domain level to ensure appropriate access control.</li><li><strong>Actionable dashboard </strong>You can provide an actionable dashboard to all the end users so they can monitor and assess the data quality across multiple dimensions. We can use any visualization tool we want on this DQ result data in BigQuery. Google Cloud also offers <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/data">Looker Data Studio</a> which is a simpler solution, and free, so you can try it any time.</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*JeD7-BbyNlmeoXGL" /><figcaption><strong>Example 1: D</strong>ata quality statistics as part of your centralized data products dashboard.</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*E6mw4GVkS3_CvgkM" /><figcaption><strong>Example2: </strong>Data quality statistics can provide more detailed and time-series-based insights.</figcaption></figure><p>10. <strong>Auto tagging for discovery</strong> Data quality (DQ) results can be disseminated to the catalog via Auto DQ, and indexed custom tags that are incorporated into the datasets can be created. This will facilitate the search for and discovery of high-quality data products. Incorporating data quality metrics as part of metadata can help foster trust in data and enable users to utilize it with complete confidence and effortless search-ability.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*I2AV6eC_HFq5nacW" /><figcaption>DQ tag displaying overall and dimesion specific quality scores</figcaption></figure><h3>The Federated DQ Framework: Key Benefits</h3><ul><li><strong>Improved data quality </strong>A federated DQ framework can help to improve data quality by ensuring that all data sources are subject to the same DQ standards. This can lead to improved decision making and better business outcomes.</li><li><strong>Reduced costs </strong>A federated DQ framework can help to reduce costs by eliminating the need for duplicate DQ tools and processes. This can also lead to improved operational efficiency.</li><li><strong>Increased agility </strong>A federated DQ framework can also help increase agility by enabling organizations to respond quickly to changing data quality requirements. This can give organizations a competitive advantage in today’s fast-paced business environment.</li></ul><h3>The Federated DQ Framework: Guiding tenets</h3><p>As you start adapting a federated data quality approach, here are a few guiding principles to abide by:</p><ul><li><strong>Create a unified data quality framework</strong> that serves as a guiding principle for all data initiatives within the organization. This framework should provide a consistent approach to data quality measurement, ensuring that all data is evaluated using the same standards and metrics.</li><li><strong>Objectively measure data quality</strong> Data quality should be measured objectively using quantifiable metrics such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness. This ensures that data quality is not based on subjective opinions or perceptions.</li><li><strong>Align data quality with business objectives</strong> Data quality objectives should be aligned with the organization’s overall business goals and objectives.

In a recent project, we focused on benchmarking the cost and performance of two stack choices that Yahoo wanted to understand: running Apache Flink in a self managed environment and Google Cloud Dataflow on two specific Yahoo use cases. This post details our benchmark setup, methodology, the use cases in scope, key findings, and the Dataflow configurations that helped us streamline performance.</p><p><strong>Benchmark Setup</strong></p><p>We designed our benchmark to ensure a quick, fair and rough comparison on Yahoo typical use cases; we chose two representative workloads, one compute heavy and another IO heavy task; the result of this benchmark would indicate which platform to be recommended to Yahoo teams for streaming, including writing results to BigTable, GCS, and complex streaming pipeline discussed below.</p><p><strong>Test Setup Infrastructure Diagram:</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/801/0*DzoWO3ZmrwNMjTVX" /></figure><p><strong>Metric: </strong>Our primary focus was compute cost per unit of throughput — the volume of data processed per unit of time. We aimed to understand the costs of running Flink and Dataflow pipelines at a sustained throughput of 20,000 records per second. “Cost” for Flink excludes operational overhead of setting up and running the job in the respective platform (engineering hours used).</p><p><strong>Workload: </strong>We simulated a 10TB data stream from Pub/Sub, creating a backlog of 100+ million records to maintain a constant load.</p><p><strong>Controlled Environment: </strong>To focus on core configuration impacts, we initially disabled autoscaling by fixing Flink’s resource allocation and setting a limit on Dataflow worker count. This allowed us to compare costs at a consistent throughput: i.e. cost-per-unit-of-throughput. Auto Scaling would be a dimension in the ease of operation category, which we did expand in this experiment. We verified Dataflow scaling and found it seamlessly though.</p><p><strong>Use-case details:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Write Avro to Parquet: </strong>Streaming job which reads avro message which then get windowed to certain time frames (1–5 mins) and outputted to gcs as parquet</li><li><strong>Data Enrichment and Calculation (Complex): </strong>Simulating active user analysis and event enrichment. Involved Beam state management, key reshuffling, and making external calls to another service.</li></ol><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>Operational costs of managing infrastructure are excluded for both platforms.</li><li>If the benchmark would show similar cost for both Flink and Dataflow infra cost, we were ready to pick Dataflow because Dataflow is a managed service. We were ready to benchmark a third use-case if the two use-cases above were not conclusive.</li></ul><p><strong>Understanding The Result:</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*s5Kxx3NJXtHI2d3H_h_v5A.png" /></figure><p>The table above shows that Dataflow is around 1.5–2 times more cost effective in comparison to Apache Flink on our test cases so let’s understand in more detail how we get all this cost. The idea for the benchmark is to: calculate Flink/Dataflow cost to achieve similar throughput. The goal is to have as close as possible on the number of messages processed per second on each of the streaming applications. In the table above, for the Enrichment use case, the number of provisioned vCPU on GKE is approximately 13x higher compared to Dataflow. It is not because Flink is inefficient, but it is because in Dataflow, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/streaming-engine">Streaming Engine</a> would sent a lot of the heavy computation to Dataflow backend. Of course, there was some room to improve Flink utilization, but it turned out to make the job unstable, so we did not spend further time there and <em>calculated the cost for 32 vCPUs</em> (2 x n2d-standar-16 machines) as if utilization was ~75%.</p><p>You can think of the Dataflow backend as a GCP backend resource to do heavy computation (e.g shuffling) instead of the work being done on Dataflow’s worker. This naturally makes Dataflow to require less vCPU, make it more robust and gives much more consistency throughput. It is critical for Yahoo use cases to leverage the streaming engine.</p><p>In the below image, our dataflow pipeline uses a new release <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/pricing#streaming-compute-units">cost billing feature</a> which calculates cost based on Stream Engine Processing Unit. From our testing, the new billing feature was able to optimize pipeline cost for our throughput based workloads. On the Flink side, we install telemetry and monitor pubsub throughput to check the amount of resource it is using. For Flink setup, we did not spend too much time tuning the job and therefore, assumed lowest cost if we had improved utilization; i.e. the cost is based on having 32 vCores assuming we can get around 75% cpu utilization at best case.</p><p>To see detail breakdown of the cost of Dataflow, you can simply goes to Dataflow Cost Tab, like shown below:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*0OE6vgHT6htZfEZK" /></figure><p>Here is the Dataflow command that we use to deploy our settings (in gradle):</p><blockquote>task dataflow(type:JavaExec) {</blockquote><blockquote>mainClass = “com.google.benchmark.BenchmarkDataflow”</blockquote><blockquote>classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath</blockquote><blockquote>args = [</blockquote><blockquote><strong>“ — enableStreamingEngine</strong>”,</blockquote><blockquote>“ — workerMachineType=n2-standard-8”, //or n2-standard-2 with 2 workers</blockquote><blockquote><strong>“ — dataflowServiceOptions</strong>=<strong>enable_streaming_engine_resource_based_billing</strong>”,</blockquote><blockquote>“ — numWorkers=1”, // or 2 workers</blockquote><blockquote>“ — maxNumWorkers=1”, // or 2 workers</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“ — usePublicIps=false”,</blockquote><blockquote>]</blockquote><blockquote>}</blockquote><p>The original Dataflow Streaming Engine usage is currently metered and billed based on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/pricing#streaming-data">volume of data processed</a> by Streaming Engine. With the resource-based billing model, jobs are metered based on the <em>resources that are consumed</em> and users are billed for the total resources consumed. In short, Streaming Engine Compute Units are used to calculate for “Resource Based Billing” while previously the streaming engine cost are calculated by the amount of data being sent/ process (Total GB of data process)</p><p><strong>How to tell the difference?</strong></p><ul><li>If you were to use “resource-based billing model”, you will be charged based on the SKU (stock keeping unit) not by the amount of streaming data processed</li><li>In the “Cost” tab, you should see “<strong>Streaming Engine Compute Unit</strong>” instead of “Processed Data”</li></ul><p>In addition to basic parameters, further optimization in Dataflow can be achieved by carefully customizing machine types to your specific workload. Dataflow Prime can also enhance both performance and cost-efficiency in some scenarios.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>This benchmark highlights the importance of careful configuration and ongoing experimentation when optimizing Dataflow pipelines. The ideal setup for your Dataflow deployment is highly dependent on your specific workload, data velocity, and cost-performance tradeoffs you’re willing to make. Understanding the various optimization tools within Dataflow — from worker configuration to features like autoscaling — is crucial for maximizing efficiency and minimizing cost.</p><p>When using Resource Based Billing, for the two use-cases tested in this study, we found Flink compute cost to be on par with Dataflow. Without this flag, Dataflow was 5X more expensive — again for the two use-cases in the scope of this study.</p><p>Finally, keep an eye out for new Dataflow features! The recent introduction of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/streaming-modes#set-streaming-mode">at-least-once streaming mode</a> offers greater flexibility for use cases where occasional duplicates are acceptable in favour of lower cost and reduced latency.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b189c809ff49" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/yahoo-benchmarks-dataflow-vs-b189c809ff49">Yahoo Benchmarks Dataflow vs Self-managed Flink Efficiency for two Streaming use-cases– Which is…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud">Google Cloud - Community</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
