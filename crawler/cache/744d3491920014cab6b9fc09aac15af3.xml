      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/apr/01/us-politics-news-updates-ukraine-aid</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mike Johnson says he and Marjorie Taylor Greene, who filed a motion to remove him as speaker, ‘exchanged text messages’, and they plan to talk early next week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joe Biden &lt;/strong&gt;this morning hit out at Republican House speaker &lt;strong&gt;Mike Johnson&lt;/strong&gt; after he objected to recognizing 31 March as Transgender Day of Visibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presidents often designate certain days or months in recognition of groups or causes, but 31 March also happened to be Easter Sunday, prompting the House speaker, a prominent conservative Christian with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/27/mike-johnson-christian-bible-lgbtq-abortion-rights"&gt;a history of opposing LGBTQ+ rights&lt;/a&gt;, to accuse Biden of “banning sacred truth and tradition”:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/apr/01/us-politics-news-updates-ukraine-aid"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Baltimore bridge collapse: temporary channel planned for ‘essential vessels’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/01/temporary-ship-route-baltimore-bridge-collapse</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alternate shipping channel will be created north-east of the main artery, near the bridge itself, according to city officials &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities are &lt;a href="https://www.dvidshub.net/video/917547/unified-command-prepares-opening-temporary-alternate-channel-near-key-bridge"&gt;preparing to create a temporary alternate channel&lt;/a&gt; near Baltimore’s collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge to allow “commercially essential vessels” to enter the city’s port.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deadly crumpling of the bridge after it was struck by a massive container ship last week created wreckage that has been blocking a crucial shipping lane into the port. Concerns have loomed about the disaster’s widespread toll on the local and national economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/01/temporary-ship-route-baltimore-bridge-collapse"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Conspiracy, monetisation and weirdness: this is why social media has become ungovernable | Nesrine Malik</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/01/conspiracy-monetisation-social-media-kate-middleton</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The royals are perennial clickbait, but the wild online bunkum over the Princess of Wales reveals new and darker forces&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On TikTok, there is a short clip of what an AI voiceover claims is a supposed “ring glitch” in the video in which Princess of Wales reveals her cancer diagnosis. It has 1.3 million views. Others, in which users “break down” aspects of the video and analyse the saga with spurious evidence, also rack up millions of views and shares. I have then seen them surface on X, formerly known as Twitter, and even shared on WhatsApp by friends and family, who see in these videos, presented as factual and delivered in reporter-style, nothing that indicates that this is wild internet bunkum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something has changed about the way social media content is presented to us. It is both a huge and subtle shift. Until recently, types of content were segregated by platform. Instagram was for pictures and short reels, TikTok for longer videos, X for short written posts. Now Instagram reels post TikTok videos, which post Instagram reels, and all are posted on X. Often it feels like a closed loop, with the algorithm taking you further and further away from discretion and choice in who you follow. All social media apps now have the equivalent of a “For you” page, a feed of content from people you don’t follow, and which, if you don’t consciously adjust your settings, the homepage defaults to. The result is that increasingly, you have less control over what you see.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/01/conspiracy-monetisation-social-media-kate-middleton"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A surprise set of results has given Turkey’s main opposition party a major boost and enhanced the prospects of democratic renewal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than a year ago, Turkey’s main opposition parties were in a slough of despond. Defying their predictions, the country’s authoritarian leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, comfortably &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/28/polls-close-in-second-round-of-the-turkish-presidential-election#:~:text=Recep%20Tayyip%20Erdo%C4%9Fan%20has%20extended,stark%20and%20persistent%20political%20polarisation."&gt;won&lt;/a&gt; a third term in presidential elections held last spring. At the same time, his Justice and Development party (AKP) emerged more powerful from a parliamentary poll, despite the economy tanking and dissatisfaction at the government’s response to the worst &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/02/2023-turkish-earthquake-then-and-now"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; for decades. Years of clientelism, culture wars and overwhelming media dominance appeared to have rendered Mr Erdoğan’s strongman politics all but unassailable at national level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small wonder then, that a spectacular and unanticipated &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/31/turkey-local-elections-istanbul-mayor-ekrem-imamoglu-recep-tayyip-erdogan"&gt;turnaround&lt;/a&gt; at Sunday’s local elections prompted wild celebrations into the early hours. In Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city, the incumbent mayor, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/01/who-is-ekrem-imamoglu-istanbul-mayor-recep-tayyip-erdogan-reign-president-ak-party#:~:text=The%20opposition's%20victory%2C%20pushing%20aside,of%20his%20desire%20to%20bring"&gt;Ekrem Imamoğlu&lt;/a&gt;, trounced Mr Erdoğan’s candidate. Mr Imamoğlu’s Republican People’s party (CHP) also pulled off a clean sweep of other major cities, winning by a landslide in the capital, Ankara, and easily in Izmir. More suprisingly, the CHP managed to chalk up some victories in the conservative towns and villages that make up Mr&amp;nbsp;Erdoğan’s electoral heartland in Anatolia, and near the Black Sea. Gains in those regions for the Islamic far‑right New Welfare party (YRP), at the AKP’s&amp;nbsp;expense, added to the president’s misery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/01/the-guardian-view-on-erdogan-bad-night-at-the-polls-local-elections-packing-a-national-punch"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Wags are back – but I miss the carefree days of Posh and Coleen | Zoe Williams</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/01/the-wags-are-back-but-i-miss-the-carefree-days-of-posh-and-coleen</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the 2006 World Cup, the England team’s wives and girlfriends could drink, shop and pose all they liked. Eighteen years on, fun seems to be in short supply&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It raises all kinds of sad questions to hear that the England footballers’ wives and girlfriends are heading to Euro 24 with &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13257897/Englands-WAGs-private-bodyguards-Euro-2024-Germany-terror-threat.html"&gt;£100,000 worth of private security&lt;/a&gt;. The whole point of the Wags was that they occupied a timeless place, untouched by current affairs or the pace of change. They never had to justify themselves with good works or decorum. Not even the gristliest, dungaree-clad feminist (me, let’s say) minded their self-fashioning as pure adornments for their celebrated menfolk. They could have careers of their own, or not have careers; drink WKD or drink kale juice; they could have been poets or they could have been fools. In the modern business of perpetual censure, they were (as the management consultants would put it) outside scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And perhaps they still are, and the German government is overreacting in &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13256187/New-level-terror-threat-England-fans-Euro-2024-Germany-following-appalling-ISIS-attack-Moscow-week.html"&gt;its perception of a terrorist threat from Islamic State Khorasan Province&lt;/a&gt;, the IS offshoot thought to be &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/moscow-concert-hall-attack-2024"&gt;behind the Moscow attack last month&lt;/a&gt;. But the caution is probably warranted. Nothing is sacred to a terrorist, and the random sanctity of a Wag – the vanishingly rare social agreement to just enjoy the sight of them living their best lives – must be like a red rag to a bull, when you’re a misogynist death cult.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/01/the-wags-are-back-but-i-miss-the-carefree-days-of-posh-and-coleen"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Could a three-word style mantra help me look fabulous for spring? | Emma Beddington</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/01/can-a-three-word-style-mantra-save-me-from-lifelong-dishevelment</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I want Lydia Tár’s wardrobe or to look like a liberated 1930s heiress. But I need to be realistic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As winter (black elastic-waisted trousers, four motheaten jumpers) gives way to spring (khaki trousers, two jumpers), the harsh April light forces me to confront the truth: I’m in aesthetic freefall. In search of a solution that isn’t capitulating to the “miracle” trousers that stalk me around the internet, I came across &lt;a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/three-word-style-method-tiktok-allison-bornstein"&gt;this bold statement&lt;/a&gt; on the website Refinery 29: “Just three words stand between you and figuring out personal style,” . What are they? “Move to Iona”? “Vast lottery win”? “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/dec/21/cate-blanchett-tar-would-have-been-jealous-of-maestro-fo-shizz"&gt;Lydia Tár’&lt;/a&gt;s wardrobe”? (You’d need the former for the latter; I couldn’t even afford her &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pencils/comments/116kc40/calculating_the_cost_of_lydia_t%C3%A1rs_blackwing/"&gt;pencils&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, the “three-word method”, devised by stylist &lt;a href="https://www.allisonbornstein.com/"&gt;Allison Bornstein&lt;/a&gt;, involves thinking up, yes, three words to describe your style. Then you can “ask yourself if you feel like you embody (ideally) all three of your words” when you get dressed and “interrogate whether it aligns with one of your words” when you are considering buying something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/01/can-a-three-word-style-mantra-save-me-from-lifelong-dishevelment"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>I stopped apologising for my poor German, and something wonderful happened | Ying Reinhardt</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/01/language-skills-germany-native-speakers</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a decade in Germany, I was still anxious talking to native speakers – then I realised my language skills weren’t the problem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have prefaced every conversation with, “&lt;em&gt;Entschuldigung, mein Deutsch ist noch nicht so gut&lt;/em&gt;” (“I’m sorry, my German is still not very good”) since I moved to Hermsdorf, a little village in east Germany in 2015. Its purpose was to act as a disclaimer upfront so that the German person I was talking to wouldn’t expect me to articulate complicated ideas or respond promptly and accurately to everything that was said. But mostly, my opening line was a plea for mercy, a signal that I was still learning the language and would greatly appreciate it if they spoke more slowly and clearly. They would always graciously reply: “&lt;em&gt;Ja, Deutsch ist eine schwere Sprache.&lt;/em&gt;” German is a difficult language, they all agreed. And for the longest time, that was true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Kuala Lumpur as Malaysian Chinese, I speak English almost natively, given that Malaysia was once a British colony. I also speak Malay, Malaysia’s official language, and Mandarin and Cantonese because I needed to communicate with my grandparents. Before moving to Germany, I already spoke Italian after working on board cruise ships for years alongside Italian officers, and conversational French after dating a Frenchman. Then, I met the man who would later become my husband in a bar on the 63rd floor of a building in Singapore and a thought occurred to me: “Wouldn’t it be funny if I have to learn German this time?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/01/language-skills-germany-native-speakers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Football’s elite are tightening up – and Arsenal lead the pack</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/01/arsenal-manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-title-race</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Premier League has experienced a goal-scoring surge this season. But Mikel Arteta’s team have created an edge by eliminating chances&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/20/sign-up-for-soccer-with-jonathan-wilson-his-free-weekly-newsletter-on-european-soccer"&gt;Sign up to Jonathan’s weekly newsletter here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who said football was supposed to be fun? Sunday’s meeting between Manchester City and Arsenal was billed as an epic showdown between sorcerer and apprentice that might decide the league title. It produced a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/01/manuel-akanji-accuses-arsenal-tactical-fouling-manchester-city"&gt;total of three shots on target&lt;/a&gt; – which is to say as many as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/31/premier-league-awards-salah-liverpool-anthony-gordon-man-city"&gt;Brentford had against Manchester United &lt;/a&gt;between the 53rd and 55th minutes. Admire the tactical machinations if you like, the levels of concentration and the planning that went into it, the obviously refined level of the lack of action, but this was shit on a stick for the TikTok generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, in many ways it was worse. When the great former Argentina forward Jorge Valdano came up with his line in Marca to describe &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/02/match.sport"&gt;the second leg of the 2007 Champions League semi-final&lt;/a&gt; between Liverpool and Chelsea – “Put a shit hanging from a stick in the middle of this passionate, crazy stadium and there are people who will tell you it’s a work of art. It’s not: it’s a shit hanging from a stick” – he was at least describing a knockout tie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/01/arsenal-manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-title-race"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cornerback wanted over allegations of domestic violence&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;29-year-old surrenders to authorities in Florida&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cam Sutton has turned himself in, ending a weeks-long search for the former NFL defensive back who was wanted for a domestic violence warrant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office announced the 29-year-old arrived at a jail in Tampa, Florida, on Sunday night, nearly a week after his attorney informed authorities that the former Detroit Lions and Pittsburgh Steelers standout would turn himself in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“After weeks of evading law enforcement, this man has finally made the right choice to turn himself in,” Hillsborough County sheriff Chad Chronister said. “Domestic violence has no place in our community, and no one is above the law here in Hillsborough County. My thoughts are with this woman as she continues to heal from this man’s gruesome actions.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sutton’s initial arrest warrant charged him with a felony, but prosecutors said Monday he was being formally charged with misdemeanor battery, which carries a maximum one-year jail sentence. Sutton was released from jail on Monday on his own recognizance, the state attorney’s office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheriff’s department responded to a call about domestic violence in progress involving Sutton and a female around 5am on 7 March. Nearly two weeks ago, the sheriff’s office asked for help in finding Sutton.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon thereafter, Lions president Rod Wood said Sutton was at the team’s training facility just outside of Detroit. He said a member of Lions staff advised Sutton to turn himself in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/01/former-lions-star-cameron-sutton-turns-himself-in-after-weeks-long-police-search"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>No 11 seed NC State upset Duke to advance to men’s Final Four</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/31/no-11-seed-nc-state-upset-duke-to-advance-to-mens-final-four</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;North Carolina State 76-64 Duke&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wolfpack will take on Purdue in national semifinals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruising big man DJ Burns Jr scored a season-high 29 points, DJ Horne scored 20 and 11th-seeded North Carolina State reached their first Final Four in four decades, beating Atlantic Coast Conference rival Duke 76-64 in the South Region final on Sunday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NC State (26-14) are back in the national semifinals for the first time since the late Jim Valvano was sprinting around the court looking for someone to hug after winning the 1983 national title with an upset over Houston.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These Wolfpack players will head to Glendale, Arizona, next weekend with a nine-game winning streak. After losing their last four regular-season games, and seven of nine, they had to win five games in five days in the ACC Tournament, including a win over Duke in the quarterfinal round, just to get into the 68-team NCAA field. Now they will play Zach Edey and Purdue in the first national semifinal, before the defending champions, UConn, take on Alabama.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fourth-seeded Duke (27-9), who ousted top seed Houston in the Sweet 16 two nights earlier, missed out on their second Final Four in three seasons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon after Wolfpack coach Kevin Keatts was called for a technical foul with eight minutes left, his team had a double-digit lead and was well on the way to becoming the seventh double-digit seed to make the Final Four since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jared McCain made both free throws for the technical that Keatts got after officials ruled a missed shot by Duke’s Kyle Filipowski that went over the backboard and off the shot clock went off one of his players. Replays showed that while there probably should have been a foul since Burns made contact with Filipowski’s arm, the hand of the Wolfpack’s 6ft 9in 275lb forward wasn’t close to the ball.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A minute later, Ben Middlebrooks had a steal that led to a fast-break three-pointer by Michael O’Connell. There was a foul called while the ball was in the air, so the Wolfpack kept possession and Burns made another nifty basket for a 53-42 lead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;O’Connell had six points, but finished with 11 rebounds and six assists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;McCain led Duke with 32 points, the freshman guard hitting 8 of 20 shots and making all 11 of his free throws. Jeremy Roach had 13 points while 7ft center Filipowski had 11 points and nine rebounds before fouling out with 4:52 left and the Blue Devils already down eight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/31/no-11-seed-nc-state-upset-duke-to-advance-to-mens-final-four"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christina Bobb, who was part of Trump-backed fake elector scheme, tapped to run unit by Republican National Committee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump"&gt;Donald Trump’s&lt;/a&gt; presidential campaign has cemented its hold on the Republican National Committee (RNC), alarms are being raised about the organisation’s tapping of the fervent election denialist Christina Bobb to run an “election integrity” unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bobb is a former Trump lawyer and ex-reporter for the far-right One America News Network, who gained prominence after Trump’s 2020 loss for promoting bogus fraud charges in Arizona, Wisconsin and elsewhere, and was part of Trump-backed efforts to substitute fake electors for ones that Joe Biden won in some states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/01/republican-election-integrity-denier"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Senator Raphael Warnock: ‘The Bible doesn’t need Trump’s endorsement’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/01/trump-selling-bibles-risky-business-senator-raphael-warnock</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ex-president’s decision to sell Bibles branded with his name is ‘risky business’, says Warnock, pastor of historic Atlanta church&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;’s decision to sell Bibles branded under his name is “risky business”, the Democratic US senator Raphael Warnock said on Sunday, as the former president stands accused of having few moral scruples in four separate criminal indictments pending against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Bible does not need Donald Trump’s endorsement,” Warnock, the pastor of Atlanta’s historic Ebenezer Baptist church, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNNSOTU/status/1774425132930400554"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; to CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday. Speaking on Easter, one of Christianity’s holiest celebrations, Warnock added: “It’s a risky bet because the folks who buy those Bibles might actually open them up, where it says things like thou shalt not lie, thou shalt not bear false witness, where it warns about wolves dressed up in sheep’s clothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/01/trump-selling-bibles-risky-business-senator-raphael-warnock"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/28/sam-bankman-fried-sentenced-prison-ftx-fraud</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Judge orders disgraced crypto mogul to forfeit $11bn in assets and says he showed no remorse for his crimes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced cryptocurrency mogul who perpetrated one of the largest financial frauds in history, has been sentenced to 25 years&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in prison and ordered to forfeit $11bn in assets. His lawyer reiterated a pledge to appeal the sentence the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge, Lewis Kaplan, issued the penalty in a Manhattan courtroom on Thursday. Bankman-Fried, the former chief executive of the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/02/sam-bankman-guilty-ftx-alameda"&gt;convicted of fraud and conspiracy to launder money&lt;/a&gt; late last year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/28/sam-bankman-fried-sentenced-prison-ftx-fraud"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Michael Gove has ‘zero sympathy’ for ‘arrogant’ Thames Water in funding crisis – as it happened</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/mar/28/thames-water-crisis-sewage-rivers-funding-uk-recession-gdp-economy-sterling-business-live</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets as minister says water company’s leadership has been a ‘disgrace’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The UK government has said it is prepared for “a range of scenarios” for Thames Water.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A government spokesperson said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any company needing to secure new investment there are a wide range of options available to water companies, including the injection of new equity from any prospective investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ofwat, as the financial regulator of the water sector, continues to engage with Thames Water to improve its financial resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to pollute rivers, and nor does anyone in Thames Water. I would point out that &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt; has many different sources. It’s not just from sewage; it’s also from land run-off, it is from highway run-off; it is from animal faeces. All of those things contribute to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I am absolutely determined that at Thames, that we will pay our part in cleaning up the problem, and so the Thames is a river that people can use as they would like to every day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/mar/28/thames-water-crisis-sewage-rivers-funding-uk-recession-gdp-economy-sterling-business-live"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
