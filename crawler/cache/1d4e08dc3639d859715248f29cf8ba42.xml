Cohen, who was former President <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/donald-j-trump">Donald Trump</a>’s lawyer and “fixer,” was convicted for making false statements to a bank to get a home equity loan for $500,000, concealing $4 million from the IRS, lying to Congress by claiming a Russian business project had not been pursued after Trump became the Republican nominee in 2016, and violating campaign finance laws by arranging for the $130,000 payment to <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/stormy-daniels">Stormy Daniels</a> to keep her silent in an effort to aid the Trump 2016 campaign.</p><p>Consistently missing from the media coverage is the reminder to viewers that all but two of Cohen’s convictions came in service of Trump and allegedly at his direction.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-vilification-of-michael-cohen">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-vilification-of-michael-cohen</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-vilification-of-michael-cohen</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Shan Wu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 13:58:36 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Violent Secret of the Couple Behind ‘the Dress That Broke the Internet’]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_513,w_912,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/the_dress_rxi2ok_nkvtdz"><figcaption>Tumblr</figcaption></figure><p>Almost a decade after Keir Johnston found viral fame with “The Dress,” he’s back in the headlines once again.

No matter the tears and critiques dispensed by those individuals, however, there’s little here to lose sleep over—unless, of course, your profile was in one of the two infamous data dumps.</p><p>Arriving a year after Hulu and ABC News’ <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-ashley-madison-affair-review-putting-cheaters-on-blast"><em>The Ashley Madison Affair</em></a>, Netflix’s <em>Ashley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal</em> (May 15) is a standard-issue recap of this saga, told through the eyes of a handful of insiders, journalists, and families that were devastated by the release of their confidential information. It begins with Evan Back, Ashley Madison’s former VP of sales, who joined the company in 2007 thanks to his childhood friend Noel Biderman, who had recently been hired as the start-up’s CEO after original founder Darren Morgenstern couldn’t find a way to make the business catch fire. Darren’s brother Marc participates in these proceedings, discussing the early difficulty of selling a site that was all about infidelity. He confesses that Biderman was Ashley Madison’s agent of transformative change, ushering in an era of immense growth thanks to his out-front promotion of the brand on any and every talk show that would book him.</p><p>Given Ashley Madison’s salaciousness, Biderman quickly became a TV fixture, raising the company’s profile and helping it make money hand over fist. It wasn’t long before expansion took the site around the globe, complete with nation-specific advertising campaigns that cheekily pushed the promise of covert extramarital satisfaction. In archival interview clips (since he didn’t agree to participate in this series), Biderman touts the beneficial aspects of Ashley Madison, claiming that it actually <em>saved</em> marriages by letting people explore their unfulfilled dreams without destroying the unions they loved and relied upon as the bedrock foundations of their lives. Suffice it to say, those arguments don’t sound any more convincing now than they did then; Biderman comes across as a sleazy huckster pretending to be an upstanding gentleman—an image he cultivated with the assistance of wife Amanda, who joined him on television and posed for billboard advertisements, asserting all along that they were in a monogamous relationship.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ashley-madison-sex-lies-and-scandal-review-how-a-nation-of-cheaters-were-outed">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/ashley-madison-sex-lies-and-scandal-review-how-a-nation-of-cheaters-were-outed</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/ashley-madison-sex-lies-and-scandal-review-how-a-nation-of-cheaters-were-outed</guid><category><![CDATA[Entertainment]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nick Schager]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 08:44:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Opinion: PEN America Is Right to Stay Out of Gaza War Activism]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/051124-penamerica-hero_oark64"><figcaption>Spencer Platt/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>In January 2015, Islamic terrorists murdered 12 people at the French satirical magazine <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/charlie-hebdo-on-paris-terrorists-fck-them"><em>Charlie Hebdo</em></a> for depicting the Prophet Muhammad.

Here was an attempt to comprehensively recount one of the largest, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-power-of-black-twitter">most impactful</a> online communities in history—a daunting task way beyond what most internet culture explainers ever approach. Its scope was so impressive that the feature was split into two parts.</p><p>“This story of Black Twitter is as important as the story of Facebook, as the story of all these other tech platforms,” Parham told The Daily Beast’s Obsessed in an interview at SXSW earlier this year, of the inspiration behind his feature. “Our story is valuable.”</p><p>But there was only so much that Parham could include. After all, Black Twitter is something that defies simple definition: It’s “a comedy showcase, therapy session, and family cookout all in one,” as Parham wrote in his piece. Black Twitter is the simplest way to refer to the space carved out by Black social media users, who have used the tools of the internet—memes, hashtags, trending topics—to develop a language, sense of community, and social influence.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/hulus-black-twitter-tells-the-most-important-story-in-social-media">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/hulus-black-twitter-tells-the-most-important-story-in-social-media</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/hulus-black-twitter-tells-the-most-important-story-in-social-media</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Allegra Frank]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 08:21:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The ‘Real Housewives of New Jersey’ Head Back to the Shore]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/230512-RHONJ-ep2-tease_kvekac"><figcaption>Bravo</figcaption></figure><p>Flanderization is the practice of taking a minor personality trait of a character and exaggerating it to the point they’re entirely one-note.

But JJ Wilson, the eldest son of multibillionaire <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/lululemon">Lululemon </a>founder Chip Wilson, went one step further. Not satisfied with simply “feeling amazing” and not being hungover, he decided to become one of the world’s first psychedelics tycoons.</p><p>In 2021, JJ Wilson, scion of the yoga apparel empire, co-founded a pharma-grade psychedelics manufacturer which he named Optimi Health. He stumped up start-up costs of more than $2m, a figure matched by his fellow co-founders, with more than $10m coming from financing rounds. The company is today on the brink of receiving a top-tier Health Canada license to purvey naturally-grown psilocybin and lab-made <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/mdma">MDMA</a> to legal medical markets around the world.</p><p>“I’m on a 30-day mushroom microdose protocol right now,” Wilson told The Daily Beast at a bistro in his home city of Vancouver, Canada. “Recreational therapeutic treatment can help make good people great.” A brave new world is coming, he predicts, in which most people will microdose psychedelics to banish daily scruples, enhance focus and boost well-being. After a half-century war on psychedelic drugs, this seems almost fantastical but in this near future, taking mild, even sub-perceptual, daily doses of psychedelics could be as normal as multivitamins, Wilson expects.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/lululemon-scion-jj-wilson-plots-to-make-psychedelic-drugs-the-new-yoga">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/lululemon-scion-jj-wilson-plots-to-make-psychedelic-drugs-the-new-yoga</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/lululemon-scion-jj-wilson-plots-to-make-psychedelic-drugs-the-new-yoga</guid><category><![CDATA[World]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mattha Busby]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 00:46:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Olivia Munn Reveals She Underwent Full Hysterectomy Amid Cancer Battle]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2813,w_5000,x_0,y_41/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/GettyImages-2076947563_myqjcn"><figcaption>Lionel Hahn/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/olivia-munn">Olivia Munn</a> is still on her journey back to health after being diagnosed with breast cancer last year.</p><p>The actress, 43, revealed to <em><a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/olivia-munn-exclusive-interview-vogue">Vogue</a> </em>in a sprawling new interview that she underwent her fifth “significant surgery” since her diagnosis just last month—a full hysterectomy. </p><p>“I took out my uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries,” she said during the remarkably candid talk about her battle with cancer.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/olivia-munn-reveals-she-underwent-full-hysterectomy-amid-cancer-battle">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/olivia-munn-reveals-she-underwent-full-hysterectomy-amid-cancer-battle</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/olivia-munn-reveals-she-underwent-full-hysterectomy-amid-cancer-battle</guid><category><![CDATA[Entertainment]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[AJ McDougall]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 00:39:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roger Corman Was the Low-Budget Filmmaker Who Remade Hollywood]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/231206-roger-corman-tease_bydl7g"><figcaption>Photo Illustration by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/Getty</figcaption></figure><p>Roger Corman never made a great movie.

The paper says Harry asked if he could stay in a royal residence when he was in the U.K. His father <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/king-charles-iii">King Charles</a> is said to have agreed to the request, but then Harry ended up staying in a hotel for three days.</p><p>Harry was “deeply stung” by not seeing Charles, the paper said.
