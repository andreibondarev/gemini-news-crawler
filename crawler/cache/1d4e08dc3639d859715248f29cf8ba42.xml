The internet interview show, where celebrity guests have to eat increasingly spicy chicken wings between each question, was a viral success because it brought out an unpredictable human side in its larger-than-life guests. </p><p>Since Rudolph had already perfected her Beyoncé impression as a cast member, centering the sketch around her made perfect sense. She quickly melted down, lashing out at host Sean Evans (played by Mikey Day) and sweating profusely. “This was the only thing I have attempted that I did not slay,” Rudolph’s Beyoncé explained in this week’s sequel sketch, “And that bothered both me and my husband. My husband is Jay-Z.”</p><p>Tragically, Beyoncé’s second attempt went south just as quickly. “Damn, my bones are hot,” she said, already covered in sweat. “That wing was a real one.

Since 1998, the center has also hosted a step-sibling event in the spring specifically for comedians: the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.</p><p>Citing Twain for “his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly,” a select committee has bestowed this award in his name to now-late greats including <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/richard-pryor">Richard Pryor</a> and Jonathan Winters, as well as to still-living legends such as Lily Tomlin and Carol Burnett.</p><p>This year, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/kevin-hart">Kevin Hart</a> has been named as the 25th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize (the Kennedy Center skipped 2020-21 due to the pandemic). And with absolutely no offense directed to Hart specifically, his selection begs the question: Why now? What has the 44-year-old stand-up comedian, movie star, and omnipresent TV commercial pitchman done to deserve singling out in 2024?</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/on-netflix-kevin-harts-mark-twain-prize-is-a-joke">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/on-netflix-kevin-harts-mark-twain-prize-is-a-joke</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/on-netflix-kevin-harts-mark-twain-prize-is-a-joke</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sean L.

This, as they say, is a rookie mistake.</p><p>I’m speaking, of course, about <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/joe-biden-reveals-ultimatum-he-gave-benjamin-netanyahu-over-weapons">Biden’s threat</a> that the U.S. will not supply weapons for <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/israel">Israel</a> to invade Rafah, a city that the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-weapons-shipment-us-eed365ebef0477ba74bf9848cacae4f4">Associated Press describes as</a> “the last major Hamas stronghold in Gaza.”</p><p>In so doing, Biden is being less than a loyal friend to Israel, an ally that rightly views Hamas as an existential threat. But he’s also alienating his <em>political</em> allies right here in America. And while we can debate the ethics of urban warfare in Gaza, what seems less debatable is the notion that this is a shrewd political move. Indeed, it strikes me as quite stupid.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/bidens-playing-dumb-politics-with-threat-to-cut-israel-military-aid">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/bidens-playing-dumb-politics-with-threat-to-cut-israel-military-aid</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/bidens-playing-dumb-politics-with-threat-to-cut-israel-military-aid</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Lewis]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2024 03:02:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Founder of Trump Defense Firm Indicted in Somali Fraud Case]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2756,w_4899,x_0,y_98/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/GettyImages-2151759922_shk28a"><figcaption>Jeenah Moon/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The federal judge overseeing a pregnancy discrimination case against <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/donald-j-trump">Donald Trump</a>’s 2016 campaign approved a bid by the ex-president and his team to switch to new legal counsel—bringing in a Maryland law firm where a top partner stands accused of bilking millions belonging to the nation of <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/somalia">Somalia</a>.</p><p>Judge Katharine Parker signed off Wednesday on the replacement of the Trump camp’s old representation, LaRocca, Hornik, Greenberg, Kittredge, Carlin & McPartland, with a lawyer from the firm Schulman Bhattacharya, LLC.
