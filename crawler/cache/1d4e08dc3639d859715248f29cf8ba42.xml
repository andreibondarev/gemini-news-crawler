How on earth could taping your mouth closed for eight hours <em>not</em> be insanely uncomfortable, harmful to your skin (ouch!), and make it borderline impossible to breathe? I was already skeptical, but some of its proposed benefits seemed downright far-fetched, including a more snatched jawline, improved sinus function, and reduced snoring. I wasn’t just skeptical; I was legitimately frightened by this emerging ‘wellness’ trend that had taken over my TikTok feed. Fast forward to two months later, and not only am I no longer<em> </em>horrified by taping my mouth (partially) closed every night before bed, but I’ve become a bona fide believer.</p><p>While the research is scant and expert endorsements of the trending modality are mixed at best, many non-expert mouth tape loyalists say that the unconventional sleep hygiene habit has changed their lives for the better, including content creator, podcast host, and founder of my favorite skincare tool brand, Lauryn Bosstick of <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1701660&m=109149&afftrack=Article&urllink=shopskinnyconfidential.com%2Fcollections%2Fshop-all%2Fproducts%2Fmouth-tape%3Fselling_plan%3D1692991581">The Skinny Confidential</a>, who called it “the best beauty tip ever,” and “like a ‘do not disturb’ for my mouth,” in a recent<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@laurynbosstick/video/7335536446759030059?q=the%20skinny%20confidential%20%20mouth%20tape&t=1715652064123"> TikTok post</a>.

But since his primary opponent is a tried-and-true conservative incumbent in deep-red West Virginia, he’s sought some extra ammunition—and found it in one of the country’s most notorious right-wing political consultants and publishers.</p><p>That publisher—Noel Fritsch, of National File—happens to have a dismal election record. But Evans is getting more than his money’s worth in the bargain, as National File has released a torrent of online attacks against his MAGAfied rival, seemingly free of charge.</p><p>Evans certainly isn’t wanting for his own MAGA bona fides. He <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-west-virginia-state-riots-9f62fe064158d9641fbe40100bd15300">stormed the U.S. Capitol Building on Jan. 6</a>, a decision that prompted his <a href="https://wvmetronews.com/2021/01/09/derrick-evans-resigns-w-va-house-after-entering-u-s-capitol-with-mob/">resignation</a> from the West Virginia legislature days later and ultimately led to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/22/evans-sentenced-jan6/">three-month prison stint</a> in 2022. And although Evans <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/west-virginia-man-pleads-guilty-felony-charge-offenses-committed-during-jan-6-capitol">pleaded guilty</a>, his campaign rhetoric two years later has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/west-virginia-republican-primary-election-deniers-ad0395542d4d5ef2b8ad5bcdec5d8495">doubled down</a> on the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. His campaign has also scored support from the chairman of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, Rep. Bob Good (R-VA), along with a smattering of Trumpworld royalty, including Roger Stone. And lest voters think he’s a single-issue candidate, Evans has made a name for himself as a local anti-abortion protester, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/01/16/derrick-evans-abortion-clinic/">harassing women at clinics and live-streaming the confrontations</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jan-6-rioter-candidate-hires-fringe-publisher-to-boost-far-right-cred">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/jan-6-rioter-candidate-hires-fringe-publisher-to-boost-far-right-cred</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/jan-6-rioter-candidate-hires-fringe-publisher-to-boost-far-right-cred</guid><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Riley Rogerson, Roger Sollenberger]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 03:11:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Miss USA Pageant Ended Up Such a Hot Mess]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/051424-missusa-hero_zeh96u"><figcaption>Photo Illustration by Luis G.
