Prosecutors say the deal was made to stop her from speaking out about an alleged one-night stand with Trump and potentially hurting his campaign.

Since debuting the three-hour victory lap of her greatest hits last March in Arizona, Swift’s show has already managed to gross over $1 billion, making the Eras Tour the first tour in history to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taylor-swift-eras-tour-billion-dollar-record-52945111233438b1f2166aa19eee365f">cross that milestone</a>. It’s projected that by the time the tour concludes, a $2 billion gross could be within Swift’s reach. </p><p>Thus far, fan reviews of their experiences at the Eras Tour have been overwhelmingly positive. But the sheer size of the stadiums Swift is packing have necessitated infrastructural sophistication from its organizers on a level that’s rarely, if ever, been seen in pop music.

It’s hard to believe, but it’s been over a year since the infamous “<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/vanderpump-rules-cheating-scandal-just-changed-celeb-gossip-forever">#Scandoval</a>” cheating reveal made headlines.

It seemed like <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> was truly back, reclaiming the throne of Bravo’s best show.</p><p>However, during the five months that this new batch of episodes has aired, tuning into each new installment was watching a gray void of absolutely nothing.

In most cases where this adage is applied, people are still making “them” like “that;” it just depends on where you’re looking. But in the case of <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/kathy-griffin-levi-johnston-and-a-bear?ref=topic"><em>Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List</em></a>—the <a href="https://thedailybeast.com/keyword/kathy-griffin">crimson-haired comic’s</a> reality show that bowed in 2010 after six stellar seasons—they absolutely do <em>not </em>make them like that anymore.</p><p><em>My Life on the D-List </em>was and is a rarity in the reality television landscape. It blurred the lines between fact, fiction, and fame by putting Griffin in increasingly ridiculous situations as she tried to claw her way to A-List stardom. The unspoken joke of the show was that Griffin was never really as D-List as she claimed to be, but that she said yes to just about any ridiculous gig or opportunity that landed in her lap, much in the way that a D-lister might.</p><p>While these engagements were always wildly funny, Griffin’s willingness to treat every gig with the same level of importance allowed the show to swerve into unexpected poignancy. If Griffin weren’t a self-described media whore, her reality show might be more like what we’re used to seeing today: <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/real-housewives-of-new-jersey-recap-back-to-the-shore">repetitive, mind-numbing grasps</a> at televised celebrity. Instead, watching it now, it’s an enthralling look at how fame has changed. Notoriety is a fleeting thrill that anyone with a phone can experience. But achieving fame and keeping it takes not just talent and drive, but genuine heart, too. Griffin understood how to take shots at her industry without alienating her peers (at least, most of the time), and rewatching her rile up the rich and glamorous today, amid an era of Hollywood toothlessness, is a guilty-pleasure binge-viewing with none of the guilt.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/there-will-never-be-another-show-like-kathy-griffins-my-life-on-the-d-list">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/there-will-never-be-another-show-like-kathy-griffins-my-life-on-the-d-list</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/there-will-never-be-another-show-like-kathy-griffins-my-life-on-the-d-list</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Coleman Spilde]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 08:27:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Do People Keep Seeing the ‘Planet of the Apes’ Movies?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/230513-spilde-apes-tease_lj2q5r"><figcaption>Photo Illustration by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/Getty/20th Century Studios</figcaption></figure><p>There are roughly 47,000—oh, wait, a new Netflix Original just dropped; make that 47,001—TV shows and movies coming out each week.

You will never be younger than you are in this moment, and let’s face it, my friend: You haven’t aged well.”</p><p>As expected, Colbert, who turned 60 on Monday, countered with an argument that soon slid into ad hominem territory: “Age ripens us like a fine wine, because with age comes experience, and with experience comes wisdom. With wisdom comes the ability to see you for what you are: a sad, dumb, salt-and-pepper idiot.”</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-carell-and-stephen-colbert-roast-each-other-in-tearful-daily-show-reunion">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-carell-and-stephen-colbert-roast-each-other-in-tearful-daily-show-reunion</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-carell-and-stephen-colbert-roast-each-other-in-tearful-daily-show-reunion</guid><category><![CDATA[Entertainment]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Michael Boyle]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 05:10:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Eurovision Responds to Reports of Backstage Chaos at Song Contest]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3039,w_5403,x_0,y_221/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/GettyImages-2152510796_y9gpwn"><figcaption>Martin Sylvest Andersen/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>It wouldn’t be Eurovision without a little controversy, but this year’s Song Contest was on another level.</p><p>If the reports of backstage tension between delegations weren’t enough to overshadow the 68th installment of the competition, then a nasty fight over Israel’s inclusion and the shock disqualification of the Netherlands’ contestant over an allegation of intimidation certainly were.</p><p>Now that the dust has settled and <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/switzerland-cruises-to-eurovision-victory-despite-protests-expulsions-and-infighting">Switzerland’s Nemo</a> has celebrated their victory, organizers are addressing the chaos.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/eurovision-responds-to-reports-of-backstage-chaos-at-song-contest">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/eurovision-responds-to-reports-of-backstage-chaos-at-song-contest</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/eurovision-responds-to-reports-of-backstage-chaos-at-song-contest</guid><category><![CDATA[World]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[AJ McDougall]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 04:26:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Televised New York Democratic Primary Debate Takes a Wild Turn]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_645,w_1147,x_77,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/Screen_Shot_2024-05-13_at_11.11.17_PM_mhdigj"><figcaption>News12</figcaption></figure><p>A New York Democratic primary debate Monday between incumbent Rep. <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/jamaal-bowman">Jamaal Bowman</a> (D-NY) and Westchester County Executive George Latimer grew heated at various points as the two debated the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/israel">Israel</a>-<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/hamas">Hamas</a> war and other topics.</p><p>The debate became so tense at one point that, as the moderator attempted to rein it in, Bowman inferred that Latimer was likening him to an “angry Black man.”</p><p>Bowman, a steadfast supporter of <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/palestine">Palestine</a>, initially clashed with Latimer over the Israel-Hamas war and its effect on U.S. politics.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/televised-new-york-democratic-primary-debate-takes-a-wild-turn">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/televised-new-york-democratic-primary-debate-takes-a-wild-turn</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/televised-new-york-democratic-primary-debate-takes-a-wild-turn</guid><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[William Vaillancourt]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 04:10:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Only The Skinny Confidential Could Get Me To Try Mouth Tape—Now I’m Hooked]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/the_skinny_confidential_mouth_tape_review_s6ycww"><figcaption>Scouted/The Daily Beast/Mia Maguire/The Skinny Confidential.</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/category/scouted"><em><strong>Scouted</strong></em></a><em><strong> selects products independently.

How on earth could taping your mouth closed for eight hours <em>not</em> be insanely uncomfortable, harmful to your skin (ouch!), and make it borderline impossible to breathe? I was already skeptical, but some of its proposed benefits seemed downright far-fetched, including a more snatched jawline, improved sinus function, and reduced snoring. I wasn’t just skeptical; I was legitimately frightened by this emerging ‘wellness’ trend that had taken over my TikTok feed.

But Evans is getting more than his money’s worth in the bargain, as National File has released a torrent of online attacks against his MAGAfied rival, seemingly free of charge.</p><p>Evans certainly isn’t wanting for his own MAGA bona fides. He <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-west-virginia-state-riots-9f62fe064158d9641fbe40100bd15300">stormed the U.S. Capitol Building on Jan. 6</a>, 2021, a decision that prompted his <a href="https://wvmetronews.com/2021/01/09/derrick-evans-resigns-w-va-house-after-entering-u-s-capitol-with-mob/">resignation</a> from the West Virginia legislature days later and ultimately led to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/22/evans-sentenced-jan6/">three-month prison stint</a> in 2022. And although Evans <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/west-virginia-man-pleads-guilty-felony-charge-offenses-committed-during-jan-6-capitol">pleaded guilty</a>, his campaign rhetoric two years later has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/west-virginia-republican-primary-election-deniers-ad0395542d4d5ef2b8ad5bcdec5d8495">doubled down</a> on the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. His campaign has also scored support from the chairman of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, Rep. Bob Good (R-VA), along with a smattering of Trumpworld royalty, including Roger Stone. And lest voters think he’s a single-issue candidate, Evans has made a name for himself as a local anti-abortion protester, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/01/16/derrick-evans-abortion-clinic/">harassing women at clinics and live-streaming the confrontations</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jan-6-rioter-candidate-hires-fringe-publisher-to-boost-far-right-cred">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/jan-6-rioter-candidate-hires-fringe-publisher-to-boost-far-right-cred</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/jan-6-rioter-candidate-hires-fringe-publisher-to-boost-far-right-cred</guid><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Riley Rogerson, Roger Sollenberger]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 03:11:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Miss USA Pageant Ended Up Such a Hot Mess]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/051424-missusa-hero_zeh96u"><figcaption>Photo Illustration by Luis G.

While most of my mom’s bags were too feminine for me (and the societal norms of that time), as I developed my own sense of style, I was always on the prowl for something compact and fashionable that I could snag from her. Now, two decades and many totes later, I no longer have to shop from mom’s closet, and I’ve realized that not all bags are a match for my busy lifestyle as a full-time publicist. But there’s one fashion house that hits the mark with bags that are timeless and practical every time: <a href="https://www.acnestudios.com/us/en/home">Acne Studios</a>.</p><p>Respectfully, <a href="https://www.acnestudios.com/us/en/home">Acne Studios</a> needs no introduction. The Stockholm fashion label has garnered renown through its multidisciplinary approach and high-profile collaborations. From Kylie Jenner’s denim transformation last year to organic endorsements from celebrities like Taylor Swift, Rihanna, and Kendall Jenner, Acne Studios continues to be a leader in fashion through Creative Director Jonny Johansson’s vision.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/acne-studios-mini-messenger-bag-review">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/acne-studios-mini-messenger-bag-review</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/acne-studios-mini-messenger-bag-review</guid><category><![CDATA[Scouted]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Wally Montes De Oca]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 20:41:55 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
