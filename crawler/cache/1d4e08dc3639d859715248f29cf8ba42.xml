She was probably out for a walk.</p><p>Though the Canadian author has, for decades, been considered the master of the short story, her stories are not short. They are quite long, and many of the characters and locales intersect with one another. In her fifty-year career, even Munro’s own work wasn’t off-limits. She has tinkered with stories published decades ago, rewriting sections or expanding endings and republishing these Frankensteins in <em>The New Yorker</em>. Like an artist that repurposes her canvas, Munro’s is a constantly evolving work. That was until her death on Monday at age 92.</p><p>But Munro’s message, if there is any “message,” is that no artist’s work is ever complete. Perhaps there’s a feeling of satisfaction, as she acquiesced in a rare interview after she was awarded the Nobel. There’s a good feeling at a job well done. But just because one has published much, or accomplished much, doesn’t mean the work is finished. Death provides an ending in Munro’s work. But it leaves many unanswered questions.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/nobel-prize-winning-author-alice-munro-dead-at-92">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/nobel-prize-winning-author-alice-munro-dead-at-92</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/nobel-prize-winning-author-alice-munro-dead-at-92</guid><category><![CDATA[Arts and Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jessica Ferri]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 16:26:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump’s MAGA Toadies Show Up to Trial, Barely Pay Attention]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/240514-trump-trial-republican-visitors-hero_xaxtwt"><figcaption>Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>Donald Trump has turned his criminal trial in New York into a photo-op and circus stop for MAGA loyalists, literally giving top political allies a front-row seat and rotating his guests each day.</p><p>Not that they’re interested in what’s actually going on in the courtroom, anyway.</p><p>Sen.

J.R.R. Tolkein knew this, which is why the <em>Lord of the Rings </em>novels never described the Dark Lord Sauron in any detail. We knew he had a body, and... that’s pretty much it. <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/peter-jackson">Peter Jackson’s</a> original trilogy followed this rule as well; the films never revealed Sauron in flashbacks, instead showing us only his flaming eye at the top of<strong> </strong>Barad-dûr. Sadly, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/tag/source/prime-video">Amazon’s</a> TV series <em>Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power </em>has decided to squander all that mystique. </p><p><em>The Rings of Power </em>has already shown Sauron in the flesh.

In a Season 2 teaser released Tuesday, however, Amazon unveiled our big bad villain’s new wig, and frankly, it’s simply too much.</p><p>Sauron does not speak in this brief clip, but he does do a powerful energy thing with his hands. All morning, I’ve wondered why Amazon decided that Sauron should look more like a rejected Death Eater from <em>Harry Potter </em>than a formidable sorcerer who will one day subjugate all of Middle-earth, but then again, I guess you should never judge a book by its cover.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/the-rings-of-power-season-2-unveils-a-goofy-looking-sauron">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/the-rings-of-power-season-2-unveils-a-goofy-looking-sauron</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/the-rings-of-power-season-2-unveils-a-goofy-looking-sauron</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Laura Bradley]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 15:27:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Yevgeny Prigozhin Finally Gets His Revenge From Beyond the Grave]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1451,w_2583,x_0,y_61/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/2023-04-08T090445Z_1505681180_RC27A0AIT732_RTRMADP_3_RUSSIA-BLAST-BLOGGER-FUNERAL-PRIGOZHIN_f1opym"><figcaption>Yulia Morozova/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>Less than 24 hours after <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> sent his defense minister packing after reportedly privately blaming him for failures in the war against <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, another top Defense Ministry official was yanked out of bed by masked security forces.</p><p>Counterintelligence agents reportedly arrived armed to the teeth to detain Lieutenant-General Yury Kuznetsov, the head of the Defense Ministry’s personnel department, on bribery charges Monday.

It’s hard to believe, but it’s been over a year since the infamous “<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/vanderpump-rules-cheating-scandal-just-changed-celeb-gossip-forever">#Scandoval</a>” cheating reveal made headlines.

In most cases where this adage is applied, people are still making “them” like “that;” it just depends on where you’re looking. But in the case of <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/kathy-griffin-levi-johnston-and-a-bear?ref=topic"><em>Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List</em></a>—the <a href="https://thedailybeast.com/keyword/kathy-griffin">crimson-haired comic’s</a> reality show that bowed in 2010 after six stellar seasons—they absolutely do <em>not </em>make them like that anymore.</p><p><em>My Life on the D-List </em>was and is a rarity in the reality television landscape. It blurred the lines between fact, fiction, and fame by putting Griffin in increasingly ridiculous situations as she tried to claw her way to A-List stardom. The unspoken joke of the show was that Griffin was never really as D-List as she claimed to be, but that she said yes to just about any ridiculous gig or opportunity that landed in her lap, much in the way that a D-lister might.</p><p>While these engagements were always wildly funny, Griffin’s willingness to treat every gig with the same level of importance allowed the show to swerve into unexpected poignancy. If Griffin weren’t a self-described media whore, her reality show might be more like what we’re used to seeing today: <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/real-housewives-of-new-jersey-recap-back-to-the-shore">repetitive, mind-numbing grasps</a> at televised celebrity. Instead, watching it now, it’s an enthralling look at how fame has changed. Notoriety is a fleeting thrill that anyone with a phone can experience. But achieving fame and keeping it takes not just talent and drive, but genuine heart, too.

You will never be younger than you are in this moment, and let’s face it, my friend: You haven’t aged well.”</p><p>As expected, Colbert, who turned 60 on Monday, countered with an argument that soon slid into ad hominem territory: “Age ripens us like a fine wine, because with age comes experience, and with experience comes wisdom. With wisdom comes the ability to see you for what you are: a sad, dumb, salt-and-pepper idiot.”</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-carell-and-stephen-colbert-roast-each-other-in-tearful-daily-show-reunion">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-carell-and-stephen-colbert-roast-each-other-in-tearful-daily-show-reunion</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-carell-and-stephen-colbert-roast-each-other-in-tearful-daily-show-reunion</guid><category><![CDATA[Entertainment]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Michael Boyle]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 05:10:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Eurovision Responds to Reports of Backstage Chaos at Song Contest]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3039,w_5403,x_0,y_221/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/GettyImages-2152510796_y9gpwn"><figcaption>Martin Sylvest Andersen/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>It wouldn’t be Eurovision without a little controversy, but this year’s Song Contest was on another level.</p><p>If the reports of backstage tension between delegations weren’t enough to overshadow the 68th installment of the competition, then a nasty fight over Israel’s inclusion and the shock disqualification of the Netherlands’ contestant over an allegation of intimidation certainly were.</p><p>Now that the dust has settled and <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/switzerland-cruises-to-eurovision-victory-despite-protests-expulsions-and-infighting">Switzerland’s Nemo</a> has celebrated their victory, organizers are addressing the chaos.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/eurovision-responds-to-reports-of-backstage-chaos-at-song-contest">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/eurovision-responds-to-reports-of-backstage-chaos-at-song-contest</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/eurovision-responds-to-reports-of-backstage-chaos-at-song-contest</guid><category><![CDATA[World]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[AJ McDougall]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 04:26:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Televised New York Democratic Primary Debate Takes a Wild Turn]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_645,w_1147,x_77,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/Screen_Shot_2024-05-13_at_11.11.17_PM_mhdigj"><figcaption>News12</figcaption></figure><p>A New York Democratic primary debate Monday between incumbent Rep. <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/jamaal-bowman">Jamaal Bowman</a> (D-NY) and Westchester County Executive George Latimer grew heated at various points as the two debated the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/israel">Israel</a>-<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/hamas">Hamas</a> war and other topics.</p><p>The debate became so tense at one point that, as the moderator attempted to rein it in, Bowman inferred that Latimer was likening him to an “angry Black man.”</p><p>Bowman, a steadfast supporter of <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/palestine">Palestine</a>, initially clashed with Latimer over the Israel-Hamas war and its effect on U.S. politics.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/televised-new-york-democratic-primary-debate-takes-a-wild-turn">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/televised-new-york-democratic-primary-debate-takes-a-wild-turn</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/televised-new-york-democratic-primary-debate-takes-a-wild-turn</guid><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[William Vaillancourt]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 04:10:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Only The Skinny Confidential Could Get Me To Try Mouth Tape—Now I’m Hooked]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/the_skinny_confidential_mouth_tape_review_s6ycww"><figcaption>Scouted/The Daily Beast/Mia Maguire/The Skinny Confidential.</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/category/scouted"><em><strong>Scouted</strong></em></a><em><strong> selects products independently.

How on earth could taping your mouth closed for eight hours <em>not</em> be insanely uncomfortable, harmful to your skin (ouch!), and make it borderline impossible to breathe? I was already skeptical, but some of its proposed benefits seemed downright far-fetched, including a more snatched jawline, improved sinus function, and reduced snoring. I wasn’t just skeptical; I was legitimately frightened by this emerging ‘wellness’ trend that had taken over my TikTok feed. Fast forward to two months later, and not only am I no longer<em> </em>horrified by taping my mouth (partially) closed every night before bed, but I’ve become a bona fide believer.</p><p>While the research is scant and expert endorsements of the trending modality are mixed at best, many non-expert mouth tape loyalists say that the unconventional sleep hygiene habit has changed their lives for the better, including content creator, podcast host, and founder of my favorite skincare tool brand, Lauryn Bosstick of <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1701660&m=109149&afftrack=Article&urllink=shopskinnyconfidential.com%2Fcollections%2Fshop-all%2Fproducts%2Fmouth-tape%3Fselling_plan%3D1692991581">The Skinny Confidential</a>, who called it “the best beauty tip ever,” and “like a ‘do not disturb’ for my mouth,” in a recent<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@laurynbosstick/video/7335536446759030059?q=the%20skinny%20confidential%20%20mouth%20tape&t=1715652064123"> TikTok post</a>. Unlike most lifestyle podcasters and small business owners, I trust this woman’s recommendations implicity. I mean, just look at her impeccably chiseled jawline.
