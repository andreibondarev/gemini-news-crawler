She came out to the “Update” desk in an elaborate <em>Dune</em>-esque worm costume, and declared herself to be a huge fan of the independent presidential candidate.</p><p>“I mean, come on, look at this guy. What worm wouldn’t love this?” she told Colin Jost. “He looks like a pack of chicken thighs left out in the sun. And check out his face! He looks like someone left Bruce Springsteen in the microwave too long.”</p><p>Sherman poked fun at RFK’s anti-vax platform, saying that the best part of living inside RFK’s body was just how many other fun creatures were living there with her. “RFK’s body was a worm’s paradise, okay? Not a single drop of vaccine in sight. My whole parasite posse hung out in there. Shout out to hookworm, botfly, that fish that swims up your pee stream, and my man, Tom Sandoval.”</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/snls-sarah-sherman-plays-the-worm-in-rfk-jrs-brain-on-weekend-update">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/snls-sarah-sherman-plays-the-worm-in-rfk-jrs-brain-on-weekend-update</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/snls-sarah-sherman-plays-the-worm-in-rfk-jrs-brain-on-weekend-update</guid><category><![CDATA[Entertainment]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Michael Boyle]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2024 05:08:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Maya Rudolph Reprises Beyoncé Role in SNL Hot Ones Sketch]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/Screenshot_3672_vcqzf7"><figcaption>NBC / SNL </figcaption></figure><p>The last time <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/maya-rudolph">Maya Rudolph</a> hosted Saturday Night Live in March 2021, the show struck gold with one simple comedic premise: what if the seemingly unflappable musician <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/beyonce">Beyoncé</a> had to go on Hot Ones? The viral internet interview show, where celebrity guests have to eat increasingly spicy chicken wings between each question, was famous because of how it brought out an unpredictable human side in its larger-than-life guests. </p><p>With Rudolph having already perfected her Beyoncé impression as a cast member, centering the sketch around her made perfect sense. She quickly melted down, lashing out at host Sean Evans (played by Mikey Day) and sweating profusely. “This was the only thing I have attempted that I did not slay,” Rudolph’s Beyoncé explained in this week’s sequel sketch, “And that bothered both me and my husband. My husband is Jay-Z.”</p><p>Tragically, Beyoncé’s second attempt went south just as quickly. “Damn, my bones are hot,” she said, already covered in sweat. “That wing was a real one.

The following year she tested for a movie role at 20th Century Fox. Studio head Darryl Zanuck saw her screen test, said, “Sign that girl,” and presented her with a list of new last names. “They all sounded like I should have looked like Lana Turner, or been a stripper, all except Bancroft, which sounded dignified,” she remembered, then spent the fifties typecast as a film noir starlet in movies ranging from <em>New York Confidential</em> to <em>Gorilla at Large</em> to <em>The Girl in Black Stockings</em>.</p><p>The last straw came after a string of forgettable roles. “I began to realize you can’t wait for the gods to bless you with the right part,” said Bancroft. “Finally, I thought I’d help the gods help me.

It was in this fecund soil that <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/ashley-madison">Ashley Madison</a>—the infamous website dedicated to extramarital affairs—became a household name. The website and its purposely eye-raising slogan—“Life is short, have an affair”—seemed to define a decade filled with tawdry turpitude and tabloid titillation.</p><p>But when I recently received an email from the Ashley Madison press team, my first reaction was, “That still exists?” (I am apparently not alone here: The first suggested search when you type the company into Google: “Is Ashley Madison still a thing?”)</p><p>It’s not just that the site suffered one of the most famous <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ashley-madison-hack-10000-govt-officials-email-addresses-on-leaked-ashley-madison-list">data breaches</a> of the 21st century, revealing millions of member accounts and exposing the affairs of <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/pentagon-gives-free-pass-to-ashley-madison-cheaters?ref=topic">government</a> workers, celebrities, and probably your middle school softball coach. It’s also that, in the golden age of “ethical non-monogamy,” when <em>New York</em> magazine is publishing “A Practical Guide to Polyamory” as its cover story, and major celebrities are coming clean about their open marriages, you have to wonder if anyone is still having “affairs”—especially on a website older than Facebook.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-once-scandalous-ashley-madison-stays-hot-in-the-era-of-throuples">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-once-scandalous-ashley-madison-stays-hot-in-the-era-of-throuples</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-once-scandalous-ashley-madison-stays-hot-in-the-era-of-throuples</guid><category><![CDATA[U.S. News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Emily Shugerman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2024 02:37:36 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
