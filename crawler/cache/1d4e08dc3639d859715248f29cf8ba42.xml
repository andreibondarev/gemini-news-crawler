Rendon/The Daily Beast/Getty</figcaption></figure><p>Paul’s Letter to the Romans is widely regarded as the most theologically sophisticated and influential book in the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/new-testament">New Testament</a>. There’s no questioning its importance, and (unlike<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/are-the-gospels-finished-works"> many books of the New Testament</a>) no scholar has ever doubted that Paul himself wrote it. Yet this last point is remarkable precisely because it is so demonstrably untrue. Paul did not <em>write</em> this letter—or, at the very least, he did not write it alone. Tucked into the conclusion of the letter is a simple but striking interruption: “I, Tertius, the writer of this letter, greet you in the Lord” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+16%3A22&version=NRSVUE">Rom 16:22</a>).</p><p>Who was Tertius? Almost every artistic depiction of Paul—from the carefully laid ancient murals of Ravenna to the color-saturated portraits of the Renaissance—shows Paul working alone, quill in hand, engrossed in the act of writing. In some depictions, he looks heavenward as if asking for or receiving heavenly inspiration. Paul rarely turns to another person. Yet here, in the letter itself, we find the name of another writer.</p><p>The most minimalist opinion on the subject is that Tertius was Paul’s secretary<em>­</em>. He was, in other words, one of the tens of thousands of erudite enslaved or formerly enslaved people who acted as stenographers, transcribed ideas, and edited the documentary output of the Roman world. With only a few exceptions, when tradition and scholarship identify Tertius they call him a “scribe,” “professional,” or “associate.” Language like this creates the impression Tertius was an educated volunteer or friend, someone who willingly lent his skills to his spiritual mentor. It ignores the fact that the people who worked as ancient secretaries were not part of an ambitious and educated middle class: they were people whose freedom had been stolen. With a name like Tertius, which simply means “Third,” the man who committed the letter to the Romans to papyrus was almost certainly enslaved.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-much-of-the-bible-was-written-by-enslaved-people">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-much-of-the-bible-was-written-by-enslaved-people</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-much-of-the-bible-was-written-by-enslaved-people</guid><category><![CDATA[Arts and Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Candida Moss]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2024 01:19:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tucker Carlson’s Alma Mater Says He Wrongly Recorded Student Zoom Session]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2504,w_4452,x_0,y_115/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/2023-07-15T222816Z_835641852_RC2Y32ADA2XV_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-REPUBLICANS_vmkgyu"><figcaption>Marco Bello/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>The Rhode Island prep school where <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/tucker-carlson">Tucker Carlson</a> graduated from in 1987 has accused the former <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/fox-news">Fox News</a> host of violating an agreement during a Zoom discussion he held with current students this week.</p><p>In a letter Friday to the St. George’s School community obtained by The Daily Beast, administrators expressed their disappointment with Carlson after he allegedly broke their agreement not to record the session.</p><p>The school explained that after a student group invited Carlson to speak on campus, the two sides had come to an agreement that a better fit was for Carlson to speak remotely, with the school citing security concerns and a Rhode Island law that prohibits guns on school campuses.

In 1989, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/de-la-soul-is-finally-streaminga-guide-to-their-best-work">De La Soul</a>’s <em>3 Feet High and Rising</em> announced the emergence of a quirky nerd rap sensibility just as the world was discovering gangsta rap; 15 years later, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/kanye-west">Kanye West</a>’s <em>The College Dropout</em> announced a shift away from street hop toward hipster rap aesthetics. And long before those, the eponymous first album from Queens legends <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jam-master-jays-murder-trial-deserves-way-more-attention">Run-D.M.C.</a> marked the dawning of hip-hop’s mainstream takeover. As such,<em> Run-D.M.C.</em>—which celebrated its 40th anniversary this week—was the beginning of an expansion on the idea of what it meant to be Black in the 1980s; an opening for street kids to assert themselves and insert their world into American popular culture.</p><p>Run-D.M.C. had been born out of the ambitions of Joey “DJ Run” Simmons, younger brother to rap promoter <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/russell-simmons">Russell</a> and early understudy to the legendary Kurtis Blow. After a tenure as Blow’s kid DJ (known as “DJ Run, Son of Kurtis Blow”), Run convinced his brother to help him record his own demo for a song called “Street Kid.” He recruited neighborhood friend Darryl McDaniels to be his rhyme partner, and after they started rapping together in their hometown of Hollis, Queens, they met an aspiring DJ in Jason Mizell (who would later go by <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jam-master-jay-murder-trial-ends-in-conviction-for-run-dmc-djs-godson-and-childhood-pal">Jam Master Jay</a>). With the elder Simmons now pushing the trio he’d dubbed “Run-D.M.C.,” they landed a deal with Profile Records and released their debut double-release single “It’s Like That/Sucker MCs” in late 1983. Lauded as the dawning of rap’s first “new school,” that hit instantly set anticipation for their first LP.</p><p>The debut album from Run, Dee, and Jam Master Jay was a recalibration of rap music—what had previously been a singles-driven genre defined by mostly party songs was moving into more album-focused, sonically hard-hitting territory. Larry Smith’s production was dark and aggressive compared to the disco sounds of earlier rap hits like The Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight,” and the subject matter took its cues from Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five’s classic commentary track “The Message.” “Rock Box” announced the trio as genre-bending innovators (a full two years before “Walk This Way,” their chart-busting collaboration with <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>) and Jam Master Jay lionized the group’s soon-to-be legendary turntablist. “It’s Like That” dropped like an atom bomb; a sinister slice of Smith-produced sonic doom that made it clear that hip-hop was entering a new day.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/run-dmc-the-rebellious-rap-debut-that-disrupted-safe-black-culture">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/run-dmc-the-rebellious-rap-debut-that-disrupted-safe-black-culture</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/run-dmc-the-rebellious-rap-debut-that-disrupted-safe-black-culture</guid><category><![CDATA[Entertainment]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stereo Williams]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2024 00:12:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Didn’t Sign Up for This’: Frustrated Lizzo Says She Quits ]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2241,w_3984,x_0,y_83/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/GettyImages-2082141338_mc2nsh"><figcaption>Leon Bennett/GA/The Hollywood Reporter via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Grammy-Award winning artist <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/lizzo">Lizzo</a>, facing <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/lizzo-reportedly-plans-to-countersue-dancers-previously-settled-payment-dispute">allegations</a> of racial discrimination, <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/sexual-harassment">sexual harassment</a>, fat-shaming, and a number other offenses in a <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/lizzos-ex-dancers-say-they-could-no-longer-stand-her-big-facade">lawsuit</a> filed last year, says she is quitting the music industry.</p><p>The singer, known for her uplifting anthems, posted to Instagram on Friday to lament her feelings, appearing to address the recent backlash, despite previously denying all allegations against her.</p><p>“I’m tired of putting up with being dragged by everyone in my life and on the internet.

She is their be-all and end-all. Music’s alpha and omega. And a few days before Resurrection Sunday, when practitioners all over the world, but especially in the deep bayous and marshes of the American South, will convene to celebrate the second coming of Christ, Beyoncé, too, has just cause for celebration.

The sprawling, 27-track LP begins through the viewpoint of Lady Liberty on “Ameriican Requiem,” because in Beyoncé’s country, she, too, is the first thing you see when you enter America on Ellis Island. There in her braided glory, cigar in her hand, pageant sash around her waist, is how she welcomes you to her United States.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/beyonce-reshapes-country-in-her-image-on-cowboy-carter">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/beyonce-reshapes-country-in-her-image-on-cowboy-carter</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/beyonce-reshapes-country-in-her-image-on-cowboy-carter</guid><category><![CDATA[Entertainment]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Taylor Crumpton]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2024 18:17:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Majority-White Tennessee Legislature Under Fire for Overhauling HBCU Board]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2668,w_4743,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/2023-09-19T235738Z_2016351845_RC2PB3A4GJB4_RTRMADP_3_USA-BIDEN-HBCU_vskipa"><figcaption>Kevin Wurm/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/tennessee">Tennessee’s</a> majority-white legislature removed, in one fell swoop, all 10 board members at the state’s only publicly funded <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/hbcu">historically Black university</a> on Thursday, a move <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/democratic-party">Democrats</a> slammed.</p><p><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/republican-party">Republican</a> Gov.
