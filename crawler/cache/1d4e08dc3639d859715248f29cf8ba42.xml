Last we heard, she was going to see her brother the day after the Season 13 reunion films.

But JJ Wilson, the eldest son of multibillionaire <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/lululemon">Lululemon </a>founder Chip Wilson, went one step further. Not satisfied with simply “feeling amazing” and not being hungover, he decided to become one of the world’s first psychedelics tycoons.</p><p>In 2021, JJ Wilson, scion of the yoga apparel empire, co-founded a pharma-grade psychedelics manufacturer which he named Optimi Health. He stumped up start-up costs of more than $2m, a figure matched by his fellow co-founders, with more than $10m coming from financing rounds. The company is today on the brink of receiving a top-tier Health Canada license to purvey naturally-grown psilocybin and lab-made <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/mdma">MDMA</a> to legal medical markets around the world.</p><p>“I’m on a 30-day mushroom microdose protocol right now,” Wilson told The Daily Beast at a bistro in his home city of Vancouver, Canada. “Recreational therapeutic treatment can help make good people great.” A brave new world is coming, he predicts, in which most people will microdose psychedelics to banish daily scruples, enhance focus and boost well-being. After a half-century war on psychedelic drugs, this seems almost fantastical but in this near future, taking mild, even sub-perceptual, daily doses of psychedelics could be as normal as multivitamins, Wilson expects.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/lululemon-scion-jj-wilson-plots-to-make-psychedelic-drugs-the-new-yoga">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/lululemon-scion-jj-wilson-plots-to-make-psychedelic-drugs-the-new-yoga</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/lululemon-scion-jj-wilson-plots-to-make-psychedelic-drugs-the-new-yoga</guid><category><![CDATA[World]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mattha Busby]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 00:46:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Olivia Munn Reveals She Underwent Full Hysterectomy Amid Cancer Battle]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2813,w_5000,x_0,y_41/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/GettyImages-2076947563_myqjcn"><figcaption>Lionel Hahn/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/olivia-munn">Olivia Munn</a> is still on her journey back to health after being diagnosed with breast cancer last year.</p><p>The actress, 43, revealed to <em><a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/olivia-munn-exclusive-interview-vogue">Vogue</a> </em>in a sprawling new interview that she underwent her fifth “significant surgery” since her diagnosis just last month—a full hysterectomy. </p><p>“I took out my uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries,” she said during the remarkably candid talk about her battle with cancer.</p><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/olivia-munn-reveals-she-underwent-full-hysterectomy-amid-cancer-battle">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p>]]></description><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/olivia-munn-reveals-she-underwent-full-hysterectomy-amid-cancer-battle</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.thedailybeast.com/olivia-munn-reveals-she-underwent-full-hysterectomy-amid-cancer-battle</guid><category><![CDATA[Entertainment]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[AJ McDougall]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 00:39:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roger Corman Was the Low-Budget Filmmaker Who Remade Hollywood]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/231206-roger-corman-tease_bydl7g"><figcaption>Photo Illustration by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/Getty</figcaption></figure><p>Roger Corman never made a great movie.

She quickly melted down, lashing out at host Sean Evans (played by Mikey Day) and sweating profusely. “This was the only thing I have attempted that I did not slay,” Rudolph’s Beyoncé explained in this week’s sequel sketch, “And that bothered both me and my husband. My husband is Jay-Z.”</p><p>Tragically, Beyoncé’s second attempt went south just as quickly. “Damn, my bones are hot,” she said, already covered in sweat. “That wing was a real one.
