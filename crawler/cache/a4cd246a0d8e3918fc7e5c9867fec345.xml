                    <description>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel would invade Rafah, despite twin pressures from Ramadan and Washington.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/benjamin-netanyahu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of surgery for a hernia on Sunday, vowed that Israel would invade Rafah, despite twin pressures from Ramadan and Washington.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu, 74, said he had approved the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israels-netanyahu-rebuffs-us-plea-halt-rafah-offensive-tensions-rise-ahead-washington-talks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;IDF’s &quot;operational plan&quot; for Rafah&lt;/a&gt;, saying the force was &quot;prepared for the evacuation of the civilian population and for the provision of humanitarian assistance.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is the right thing both operationally and internationally,&quot; he said. &quot;This will take time but it will be done. We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hamas battalions&lt;/a&gt; there for one simple reason: There is no victory without entering Rafah and there is no victory without eliminating the Hamas battalions there.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments came after the Israeli leader met with the families of the hostages still in Gaza. He rejected accusations that he was delaying their release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Those who say I am not doing everything to return the hostages are wrong and misleading, and those who know the truth and still repeating this lie are causing unnecessary grief to the families of the hostages,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/world-health-organization-silent-hamas-use-gaza-hospital-terror-hq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SILENT OVER HAMAS&apos; USE OF GAZA HOSPITAL AS TERROR HQ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu alleged that Israel has &quot;relaxed&quot; its position in negotiations while Hamas has &quot;hardened&quot; theirs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Despite all the difficulty involved, negotiations must be conducted calmly and with level-headed determination,&quot; he said. &quot;This is the only way to return hostages.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu has kept a full schedule throughout Israel&apos;s nearly six-month-long war against Hamas. A hernia was discovered during a routine checkup, but his doctors have said he is otherwise in good health. Doctors acknowledged last year that he had concealed a long-known heart problem after they implanted a pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israeli society was broadly united immediately after Oct. 7, when Hamas killed some 1,200 people during a cross-border attack and took 250 others hostage. Nearly six months of conflict have renewed divisions over the leadership of Netanyahu, though the country remains largely in favor of the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of Israelis gathered outside the parliament building in Jerusalem on Sunday, marking the largest anti-government demonstration since the war began. They urged the government to reach a cease-fire deal to free dozens of hostages held by the Hamas militant group in Gaza and to hold early elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/pro-palestinian-protesters-disrupt-berkeley-city-council-meeting-holocaust-remembrance-vote-end-israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS DISRUPT BERKELEY CITY COUNCIL MEETING, HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE VOTE: ‘END ISRAEL’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half the hostages in Gaza were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November. But attempts by international mediators to bring home the remaining hostages have failed. Talks resumed on Sunday with little expectation of a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu has said there can be no victory without a military ground offensive in Rafah, the southern Gaza city where more than half of the territory&apos;s population of 2.3 million now shelters after fleeing fighting elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaza&apos;s Hamas-run Health Ministry said Sunday that more than  32,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war. The ministry&apos;s count does not differentiate between civilians and fighters, but it has said that women and children make up around two-thirds of those killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel has disputed these figures, saying that more than one-third of the dead are militants, and it blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the group operates in residential areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Yael Rotem-Kuriel and The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Gisele Bündchen and her boyfriend pictured for the first time together since she denied cheating on Tom Brady</title>
                    
                    <description>Gisele Bündchen was photographed with boyfriend Joaquim Valente for the first time since she refuted claims she cheated on ex-husband Tom Brady with him.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/gisele-bundchen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Gisele Bündchen&lt;/a&gt; and her boyfriend, jiu-jitsui instructor Joaquim Valente, were spotted out together for the first time since the supermodel confirmed her new romance while simultaneously dispelling rumors about the inception of their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent interview with The New York Times, Bündchen vehemently denied that she had cheated on ex-husband &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tom-brady&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Tom Brady&lt;/a&gt; with Valente. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That is a lie,&quot; she told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is something that happens to a lot of women who get blamed when they have the courage to leave an unhealthy relationship and are labeled as being unfaithful,&quot; Bündchen added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/gisele-bundchens-kids-tom-brady-have-different-rules-homes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GISELE BÜNDCHEN&apos;s KIDS WITH TOM BRADY HAVE &apos;DIFFERENT RULES&apos; BETWEEN HOMES: &apos;I CAN ONLY CONTROL WHAT I DO&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They have to deal with their communities. They have to deal with their family. Of course for me, it just happens to be a little bit amplified,&quot; she told the outlet of women combating the adulterous label. &quot;No one really knows what happens between two people, only the two people in the relationship.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and Valente were spotted outside Bündchen&apos;s new mansion in Surfside, Florida, which is currently undergoing renovations. The couple were spotted discussing plans for the property with a designer before leaving the location in Valente&apos;s truck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spotting comes a day after Valente was seen supporting Bündchen at the launch of her new cookbook, &quot;Nourish,&quot; in Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it&apos;s unclear when their relationship began, Bündchen insists that the two started out as friends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is the first time I am seeing someone that was a friend of mine first,&quot; she told The New York Times, although she did not name Valente directly. &quot;It&apos;s very different. It is very honest, and it&apos;s very transparent.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/signs-tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-were-headed-end-zone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Bündchen and Brady&lt;/a&gt; divorced in 2022 after 13 years of marriage. They share two children together; Benjamin, 14 and Vivian, 11. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a month after her divorce from Brady was finalized, reports and photographs surfaced of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/gisele-bundchen-not-dating-martial-arts-instructor-joaquim-valente-despite-photos-source&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Bündchen and Valente&lt;/a&gt; together, sparking speculation they were an item. At the time, a source close to the supermodel told Fox News Digital, &quot;None of it&apos;s true.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is the kids&apos; and Gisele&apos;s longtime martial arts teacher. There&apos;s no truth to any dating rumors,&quot; the source said. Regarding the headlines, the source noted they had reached &quot;a whole new level of disrespect and disregard&quot; for Bündchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valente is one of three sons who own the Valente Brothers business in North Miami Beach. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://valentebrothers.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;business&apos; website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he &quot;moved to Miami in 2007 to study criminology at Barry University. He quickly impressed everyone with his unique technique, outstanding teaching skills and remarkable charisma. Joaquim, like his brothers, had Grandmaster Hélio as his main teacher and trained weekly with the Grand Master.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bündchen and Brady continue to co-parent their children together, both having homes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/tom-brady-kids-florida-food-bank-gisele-bundchen-divorce&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Southern Florida.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Olivia Culpo reveals &apos;most difficult part&apos; of planning wedding with Christian McCaffrey</title>
                    
                    <description>Olivia Culpo, the model fiancée of San Francisco 49ers star Christian McCaffrey, revealed the most difficult part of wedding planning so far.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With the offseason in full swing, San Francisco 49ers star &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/christian-mccaffrey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Christian McCaffrey&lt;/a&gt; and fiancée Olivia Culpo can focus on wedding planning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Culpo revealed what the hardest part has been so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model decided to engage her large following on Instagram by answering questions from them on her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/instagram&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Instagram story&lt;/a&gt;. One question asked about the &quot;the most difficult thing&quot; about wedding planning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Guest list is by FAR the hardest part,&quot; Culpo said on her Instagram story. &quot;A lot of venues have restrictions on # of ppl [people].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;recognizable NFL couples&lt;/a&gt;, trying to narrow a guest list filled with celebrities and athletes, not to mention family and friends, isn&apos;t easy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/christian-mccaffreys-brother-one-ups-49ers-star-nfl-scouting-combine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY&apos;S BROTHER ONE-UPS 49ERS STAR AT NFL SCOUTING COMBINE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple announced their engagement in April 2023, but they’ve kept their wedding plans a secret. McCaffrey has also mentioned that Culpo is the one &quot;steering the ship&quot; with those plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She’s done a hell of a job,&quot; McCaffrey told Extra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m so thankful I have someone like her who’s not just supporting me the way she is but also handling all stuff like that, allowing me to do what I love in the moment while she’s still working on her career as well.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Culpo responded to another question from a fan on Instagram when asked, &quot;What are you most looking forward to on your wedding day?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Marrying my best friend!!!!!&quot; Culpo responded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCaffrey is coming off an All-Pro season for the 49ers, though it ended with an overtime Super Bowl loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCaffrey led the NFL with 1,459 rushing yards and 14 touchdowns, while hauling in 67 receptions for 564 yards and seven more scores. That earned him Offensive Player of the Year and his second first-team All-Pro nod. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Clyburn hits back at reports he worked with GOP to gerrymander S.C. district: &apos;Absolutely not true&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Rep. Clyburn hit back at reports that he worked with the GOP to redistrict 30,000 Black voters into his own district on Sunday during &amp;quot;Meet the Press.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rep. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/rep-jim-clyburn-very-concerned-black-voter-turnout-out-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jim Clyburn,&lt;/a&gt; D-S.C., hit back at a 2023 report that alleged he worked with Republicans to maintain a &quot;grip&quot; on his South Carolina district by making sure &quot;30,000 Black voters&quot; would be redrawn into his district for the 2024 elections, which he said was &quot;absolutely not true.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;ProPublica has a report that you actually worked with Republicans on this map to maintain a tighter grip on your own district by ensuring that 30,000 Black voters would move from a neighboring swing district into your own. Was that the case?&quot; NBC News host Kristen Welker asked Clyburn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No that is not the case at all,&quot; Clyburn said. &quot;When someone picks up the phone and asks you, ‘what are your suggestions as we are about to get these lines drawn,&apos; I offered my suggestions,&quot; he said. &quot;And I certainly didn&apos;t ask my district to be turned into a minority district, and that&apos;s what it is. People keep publishing that I have a majority minority district, that is absolutely not true, check the numbers.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/south-carolina-congressional-map-stay-this-years-elections-panel-rules&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;court in South Carolina ruled&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday that this year&apos;s congressional elections in South Carolina will be held under a map that it had already deemed unconstitutional and discriminatory against Black voters, with time running out ahead of voting deadlines and a lack of a decision on the case by the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/alabama-republicans-reject-proposal-create-2nd-majority-black-district-despite-supreme-court-ruling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALABAMA REPUBLICANS REJECT PROPOSAL TO CREATE 2ND MAJORITY-BLACK DISTRICT DESPITE SUPREME COURT RULING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A panel of three federal judges from South Carolina wrote that &quot;with the primary election procedures rapidly approaching, the appeal before the Supreme Court still pending, and no remedial plan in place, the ideal must bend to the practical.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case hinges on South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District, currently held by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace. Last year, the same 3-judge panel ordered South Carolina to redraw the district, which runs from Charleston to Hilton Head Island, after finding that the state used race as a proxy for partisan affiliation in violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clyburn said people were misrepresenting what happened and that it had been going on for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, I offered my suggestions. Did they follow my suggestions? Absolutely not, and so when you say you spoke to me, and that there&apos;s an agreement, that is absolutely not true,&quot; he continued, adding that the reporter was trying to make a &quot;headline&quot; rather than &quot;headway&quot; on the story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-supreme-court-rejects-michigan-commissions-plea-overturn-order-redraw-detroit-legislative-seats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;US SUPREME COURT REJECTS MICHIGAN COMMISSION&apos;S PLEA TO OVERTURN ORDER TO REDRAW DETROIT LEGISLATIVE SEATS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/left-wing-nonprofit-leads-charge-against-justice-clarence-thomas-political-drive-by-shooting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ProPublica alleged&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 that Clyburn sent an aide, Dalton Tresvant, to meet with state Republicans about the new congressional map. The report claimed Clyburn&apos;s suggested map would benefit his standing within his own district and Republicans in a neighboring district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some of Tresvant’s proposals appealed to Republicans. The sketch added Black voters to Clyburn’s district while moving out some predominantly White precincts that leaned toward the GOP. The Republicans kept Tresvant’s map confidential as they worked through the redistricting process for the following two months,&quot; ProPublica reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to ProPublica, a spokesperson previously confirmed that they &quot;engaged in discussions regarding the boundaries of the 6th Congressional District.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After South Carolina&apos;s Legislature, which Republicans lead, redrew the district, civil rights groups swiftly filed a lawsuit, charging state lawmakers with choosing &quot;perhaps the worst option of the available maps&quot; for Black voters, arguing they had removed Black voters and made it a safer seat for Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, a 3-judge panel — the same that issued Thursday&apos;s order — concluded that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/south-carolina&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;South Carolina’s legislature&lt;/a&gt; &quot;exiled&quot; 30,000 Democratic-leaning Black voters from the 1st District to help safeguard Mace. The state appealed that ruling, and the Supreme Court heard arguments in October but has yet to issue a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Kate Beckinsale shared a new photo, apparently celebrating Easter in the hospital, as she continues to undergo treatment for an unidentified condition.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-beckinsale-wears-provocative-titanic-dress-leonardo-dicaprios-birthday-photos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kate Beckinsale&lt;/a&gt; shared a selfie of her festive Easter socks amid her ongoing health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the actress posted a photo of her legs and feet, wearing white bunny socks, in what appears to be a hospital bed with the simple caption, &quot;Happy Easter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She did not specify exactly when the photo was taken, but received support from fans and friends in the comments section on the post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen Stefani asked, &quot;What’s wrong!!!&quot; with the prayer hands emoji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-beckinsale-reveals-hospitalization-shares-tearful-photos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATE BECKINSALE REVEALS HOSPITALIZATION AS SHE SHARES TEARFUL PHOTOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British actress Alice Evans wrote, &quot;So sorry you&apos;re in hospital still, Kate. I do hope nothing is seriously wrong. I know you&apos;ve been through the ringer in the past year. Sending love and positive vibes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 11, Beckinsale revealed she had been hospitalized while praising her mom on U.K. Mother’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with photos of her mom, Beckinsale shared pictures of herself dressed in a hospital gown with a black bow in her hair. A close-up shot showed tears in Beckinsale&apos;s eyes as she laid in a hospital bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thank you to those that love us and support us when it’s s--- and try to make sure there are some bits that aren’t,&quot; the &quot;Underworld&quot; star wrote on Instagram. &quot;And for looking after our dogs when we can’t, and lead us to remember happy things when we can’t.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And turn up when we are sick and sit with us… And send balloons and check in and pull us out of wells with love,&quot; she continued. &quot;Thank you for loving us, those who do, and for the amazing, kindest Nick, and especially for my mother’s capacity for joy. It is so inspiring and beautiful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beckinsale did not indicate what caused the hospitalization. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-beckinsale-shuts-down-plastic-surgery-accusation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Representatives for Beckinsale&lt;/a&gt; did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital&apos;s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

The British TV director had also been battling two types of cancer at the time of his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beckinsale shared photos of herself still in her silver Golden Globes gown by her stepfather&apos;s side on Jan. 9.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Massachusetts faith leader says Biden&apos;s &apos;Transgender Day of Visibility&apos; a &apos;distraction&apos; yet urges compassion</title>
                    
                    <description>Amid the Biden administration&amp;apos;s declaration of March 31, 2024, as the &amp;quot;Transgender Day of Visibility&amp;quot; on the same day as Easter, faith leader in Massachusetts responds with reminders of Christ.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As Christians, even on Easter, &quot;we expect friction (if not worse) from the world (Matthew 10:16-25),&quot; said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/james-spencer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;faith leader James Spencer&lt;/a&gt; to Fox News Digital this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the right response to that, said the president of the D. L. Moody Center in Northfield, Massachusetts, &quot;is to continue to deepen our commitment to Christ through worship and discipleship.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spencer, however, expressed concern over President Biden&apos;s recent proclamation of March 31, 2024, on which Easter Sunday falls, as the &quot;Transgender Day of Visibility (TDOV)&quot; in America. Spencer noted that the announcement drew harsh reactions on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/jesus-christs-resurrection-means-all-road-emmaus-texas-pastor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JESUS CHRIST&apos;S RESURRECTION MEANS WE ARE ALL ON THE ‘ROAD TO EMMAUS,’ SAYS TEXAS PASTOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some have suggested that this was yet another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/christianity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;attack on Christianity&lt;/a&gt; by the Biden administration,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While I don’t see how declaring the TDOV on the same day as Easter, regardless of historical precedent, could encourage unity, I’m less concerned with the date of TDOV than with what I believe to be a potential distraction for the Christian community during the Easter season.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charging that politicians don&apos;t often have the church&apos;s interests at heart, he decried &quot;pandering to Christians by quoting Bible passages out of context&quot; and &quot;pointing to the truth that we are all made in the image of God to underscore human dignity without acknowledging the responsibility that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/faith-values&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;being made in God’s image&lt;/a&gt; implies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White House spokesperson Andrew Bates released a statement this weekend saying those who are critical of Biden’s inclusiveness message are trying to further divide the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a Christian who celebrates Easter with family, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt; stands for bringing people together and upholding the dignity and freedoms of every American,&quot; Bates said in an earlier statement to Fox News Digital. &quot;Sadly, it’s unsurprising politicians are seeking to divide and weaken our country with cruel, hateful and dishonest rhetoric. President Biden will never abuse his faith for political purposes or for profit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The date March 31 is one of several dates that has been designated to honor the transgender movement internationally since at least 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-doubles-down-inclusiveness-message-backlash-transgender-day-visibility-easter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHITE HOUSE DOUBLES DOWN ON INCLUSIVENESS MESSAGE AMID BACKLASH OVER TRANSGENDER DAY OF VISIBILITY ON EASTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet this year it falls on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/christianity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Easter Sunday&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — one of the most important days in all of Christianity as the resurrection of Jesus Christ is celebrated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spencer suggested some appropriate responses by Christians in the wake of the president&apos;s declaration and the actions and comments of other political officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;First, we need to recognize that our governing officials are human,&quot; Spencer said. &quot;Because they are human, they are often going to be misguided. As such, one of our first responses should be compassion. If Jesus can say it about the Roman guards who crucified Him, how can we not step back at a comparatively minor injury and say, ‘Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said as well, &quot;Jesus offers us an example of what it means to love our enemies and to pray for those who persecute us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spencer said the second potential response is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/faith&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;endure in faithfulness.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/cardinal-dolan-new-york-reveals-good-friday-message-god-has-last-word&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CARDINAL DOLAN OF NEW YORK REVEALS HIS GOOD FRIDAY MESSAGE: ‘GOD HAS THE LAST WORD&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At times, we have set our sights on fixing what only God can fix. Our job is not to fix the broken world — but to endure faithfully within it. If we long for the restoration of all things, we must first focus on living ‘lives of holiness and godliness, waiting for and hastening the day of God’ (2 Peter 3:11-12).&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spencer said that &quot;as we live such lives, we will ultimately find ourselves loving our neighbor, caring for the vulnerable and proclaiming the gospel in word and deed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In line with this, he said that &quot;our world doesn’t need to change for us to serve Christ (1 Cor 7:17-24). We serve Christ until the world around us changes and then we serve Christ some more.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And third, he said, is a potential &quot;final lesson.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Garden of Gethsemane, &quot;Jesus prayed and, in doing so, reaffirmed His willingness to submit to the Father’s will,&quot; Spencer told Fox News Digital via email. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Like us, Jesus did not want the pain and suffering He saw coming. He wanted to accomplish the work of providing a way for salvation for all who believe without the anguish of the cross.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet — &quot;in the end, Jesus wanted something else more: He wanted the Father’s will to be done rather than His own (Matt. 26:39).&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spencer added that &quot;political and social pressure may be necessary on occasion … Still, we need to cultivate the deep conviction of Christ so that we, too, may say, ‘Not as I will, but as you will.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said, &quot;The world needs to see the difference Christ makes. As such, in this moment (and a multitude of others), we must respond to Christ rather than [the world].&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we do this, he said, &quot;the world will not see our indignation or moral outrage but our unwavering loyalty to a risen Savior and Lord who has authority over all things in heaven and on Earth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-demands-biden-issue-apology-over-blasphemous-trans-visibility-day-easter-sunday-appalling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Trump campaign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; among others, blasted the White House for the Biden TDOV proclamation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We call on Joe Biden’s failing campaign and White House to issue an apology to the millions of Catholics and Christians across America who believe [Easter Sunday] is for one celebration only — the resurrection of Jesus Christ,&quot; said Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign’s press secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden White House stood by its March 29 proclamation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Transgender Americans are part of the fabric of our Nation,&quot; the White House said in its statement on March 29th. &quot;Whether serving their communities or in the military, raising families or running businesses, they help America thrive. They deserve, and are entitled to, the same rights and freedoms as every other American, including the most fundamental freedom to be their true selves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Stephen Sorace, as well as The Associated Press, contributed reporting. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>LSU&apos;s Hailey Van Lith defends teammates, calls LA Times column &apos;racist&apos; after &apos;dirty debutantes&apos; jab</title>
                    
                    <description>LSU guard Hailey Van Lith is the latest Lady Tigers basketball player to defend her teammates after a Los Angeles Times column called the team &amp;quot;dirty debutantes.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/lsu-tigers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;LSU guard&lt;/a&gt; Hailey Van Lith came to the defense of her team on Sunday after a Los Angeles Times column described the Tigers women’s basketball team as &quot;dirty debutantes,&quot; saying that perception was &quot;racist.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the Tigers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/ucla-bruins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;faced UCLA&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday for their Sweet 16 matchup – they won 78-69 with Flau’Jae Johnson leading the way with 24 points – the column was published by the L.A. Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Lith, who is White, regrets reading the column because it &quot;can crush your soul a little bit.&quot; However, she had her teammates’ backs when discussing it ahead of the Tigers’ Elite Eight game against Iowa on Monday night.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We do have a lot of Black women on this team, and unfortunately, that bias does exist still today, and a lot of the people that are making those comments are being racist towards my teammates,&quot; Van Lith said, per ESPN. &quot;I&apos;m in a unique situation where I see with myself, I&apos;ll talk trash, and I&apos;ll get a different reaction than if Angel [Reese] talks trash. I have a duty to my teammates to have their back. Some of the words that were used in that article were very sad and upsetting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Calling us the ‘dirty debutantes,’ that has nothing to do with sports. That&apos;s not motivating.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The L.A. Times removed the &quot;dirty debutantes&quot; language from the column later on Saturday, saying in a statement, per ESPN, that &quot;it did not meet Times editorial standards.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lsus-kim-mulkey-shreds-la-times-column-describing-players-dirty-debutantes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LSU&apos;S KIM MULKEY SHREDS LA TIMES OVER COLUMN DESCRIBING PLAYERS AS ‘DIRTY DEBUTANTES’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In my opinion, I know for a fact that people see us differently because we do have a lot of Black women on our team who have an attitude and like to talk trash and people feel a way about it,&quot; Van Lith continued. &quot;At the end of the day, I&apos;m rocking with them because they don&apos;t let that change who they are. They stay true to themselves, and so I&apos;ll have their back.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Lith added that her time at Louisville, where she spent her first three seasons of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;college basketball&lt;/a&gt;, and in high school saw the same criticism – a double standard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of the times, I&apos;m one of the only White people on the team, and so I do see things from a different perspective,&quot; she said. &quot;I think a lot of people who live in communities that everyone is like them, that&apos;s when they tend to think, &apos;Oh, racism doesn&apos;t exist today.&apos; But I have seen it and I experienced it, and I watch it happen to my teammates. I watch it happen to my friends.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Lith is only the latest to comment publicly about the column, as head coach Kim Mulkey ripped it, saying it was &quot;sexist&quot; and &quot;wrong.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You can criticize coaches all you want,&quot; she said, per ESPN. &quot;That’s our business. You can come at us and say, ‘You’re the worst coach in America. I hate you, I hate everything about you.’ We expect that. It comes with the territory.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But the one thing I&apos;m not going to let you do, I&apos;m not going to let you attack young people, and there were some things in this commentary that you should be offended by as women. It was so sexist. It was good versus evil in that game today. Evil? Called us dirty debutantes? Are you kidding me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can&apos;t sit up here as a mother and a grandmother and a leader of young people and allow somebody to say that. Because guys, that&apos;s wrong. I know sexism when I see it and I read it. That was awful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady Tigers star Angel Reese also defended her head coach, saying that she and her teammates are &quot;good villains&quot; who all want to help women’s basketball grow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That’s what we’re worried about,&quot; Reese said. &quot;Just being able to have teammates that have my back, have teammates, have coaches just have each other’s back this whole time. I don’t care what the outside thinks. I know what’s going on in that locker room.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>AMERICAN VALUES: How law enforcement in this small town grapples with anti-police reforms: &apos;Hands are tied&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Small town marshal, Randy Wilson, said the ongoing effort to improve and reform policing needs to be done at the local level and with input from the entire community.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A small town police force said it is still grappling against the ongoing push from anti-police activists, federal and state lawmakers to reform law enforcement practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;people and the organizations that want these policies – I understand that there&apos;s a lot that can be fixed, and I think there&apos;s a lot of things that can be changed,&quot; Noel Marshal Randy Wilson told Fox News. &quot;But here&apos;s the question: How far do you go with it to where you&apos;re tying our hands to where we can&apos;t do anything?&lt;i&gt;&quot; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson has worked in law enforcement for over 30 years, and in 2019 was elected marshal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/missouri&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;of Noel, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, a small town in the Ozarks with a population under 2,000. One of the few remaining local marshals in the state, Wilson is responsible for all general law enforcement duties in Noel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/digital-originals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big believer in &quot;old school&quot; community policing, he said fostering relationships with residents and becoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/american-values-small-town-marshal-details-cops-learn-old-school-policing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;trusted figure in town&lt;/a&gt; makes it easier to spot and defuse potential problems before they occur without having to use force. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rural community has a diverse population, with many of its residents being migrants from South America and Africa who came to Noel to work at the Tyson poultry plant in town. However, when social justice protests and calls to defund the police broke out across the country in May 2020, after the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, Wilson was not concerned about his own residents turning against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Someone said, ‘Well what’s different about you and everyplace else?’&quot; Wilson recalled being asked. &quot;I said, ‘Cause I’m elected and who do you think elects me?’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the widespread calls for reform, in 2022 President Biden &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-silent-police-policy-tyre-nichols-death-one-year-bidens-significant-reforms&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; that banned choke holds and limited the use of no-knock warrants for federal officers. It also required reports to a database of misconduct from federal officers, and encouraged, but did not require, similar reports from local law enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missouri lawmakers have also battled to pass reform in the state to address systemic racism in policing and remove &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-police-departments-cops-job-recruitment-anti-cop-climate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;barriers to disciplining officers&lt;/a&gt; for misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;It&apos;s happening here too,&quot; Sergeant Travis Sheppard told Fox News. &quot;Our hands are tied on a lot of things.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Used to be, even for misdemeanors, you could put them in jail. Now it&apos;s cite and release them,&quot; he added. &quot;From when I first started in law enforcement back in the early 2000s, it&apos;s totally different today.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/american-values-small-town-america-saying-american-dream-getting-hard&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMERICAN VALUES: What small town America is saying about the American Dream, &apos;getting too hard&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/primary-challenger-squad-cori-bush-blasts-defund-police-private-security-spending&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;state-wide changes in policing&lt;/a&gt;, and the pressure from federal lawmakers, most reforms still occur at the local level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an elected official, Wilson has more control over policing procedures than a Chief of Police would and says he has a very good working relationship with the mayor and city council. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We sit down, we discuss things,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;It&apos;s easier being elected because you can say, okay, here&apos;s the way you&apos;re telling me to do it, here&apos;s the way I see it, can we compromise here to where we&apos;re both getting what we want and we&apos;re making it work?&lt;i&gt;&quot; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Wilson and Sheppard said instead of lawmakers implementing blanket reforms, which can sometimes hinder police or make them hesitant to act in fear of facing consequences, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/law-enforcement-groups-skeptical-police-reform-talks-succeed-tyre-nichols-death&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;legislators need to consult&lt;/a&gt; more with actual officers and even citizens when tackling criminal justice reform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t think legislators know exactly what happens out here in the field,&quot; Sheppard said. &quot;They know what they&apos;re told.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These legislators ain&apos;t been out here in a patrol car. They haven&apos;t rode around. They haven&apos;t seen the stuff that we see,&quot; he added. &quot;So yeah, I think a lot of it is they&apos;re going with what they&apos;re told, going with what they believe, instead of what they know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson said improving policing should be a process that involves entire communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s a community effort,&quot; he said. &quot;If you&apos;re not working together, then where is your community going to be at?.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Rebel Wilson tried Ozempic on weight-loss journey: ‘Those drugs can be good’</title>
                    
                    <description>Rebel Wilson revealed that she tried Ozempic during her weight-loss journey and was not opposed to the idea of the drug being useful for others.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rebel Wilson, like many in Hollywood, revealed she has tried the popular weight-loss &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sharon-osbourne-doesnt-regret-taking-ozempic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;drug Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new interview with the Sunday Times, Wilson spoke about her weight-loss journey and the various methods she employed to lose approximately 80 pounds since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those was Ozempic, which she briefly used, saying, &quot;Someone like me could have a bottomless appetite for sweets, so I think those drugs can be good.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson is no longer taking Ozempic, and she ultimately focused not only on physical but mental health to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rebel-wilson-treated-different-weight-loss-transformation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REBEL WILSON DISCUSSES ‘INTERESTING’ WAYS PEOPLE HAVE TREATED HER AFTER WEIGHT-LOSS TRANSFORMATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted that people were initially reluctant to encourage her to lose weight, based on her career success playing &quot;the funny fat girl.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Basically, no one apart from my mum wanted me to lose weight,&quot; she said. &quot;People thought I’d lose my pigeonhole in my career, playing the fat funny character, and they wanted me to continue in that,&quot; she told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wasn’t dealing with my emotions properly, I was just stuffing my face and holding on to them,&quot; she said of her mental health. After speaking with a doctor to address those concerns, she said &quot;the weight just kind of dropped off.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson also pursued weight loss to improve her chances at IVF, and she &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rebel-wilson-welcomes-baby-girl-via-surrogate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;welcomed a baby girl, Royce&lt;/a&gt;, in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told the Sunday Times she is currently at a weight she’s comfortable with, calling it &quot;still curvy and solid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I feel strongly that young women shouldn’t try to obsess over looking like Victoria’s Secret models; they should just look like themselves,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;I know that my relationship with food is complicated.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her weight is part of her ongoing issues with comedian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sacha-baron-cohen-denies-rebel-wilsons-claim-was-a-hole-movie-set&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sacha Baron Cohen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Wilson revealed that the &quot;a-hole&quot; she was referring to in her new memoir, &quot;Rebel Rising,&quot; was Cohen after they worked together on &quot;The Brothers Grimsby.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I will not be bullied or silenced by high priced lawyers or PR crisis managers,&quot; Wilson wrote in an Instagram story. &quot;The ‘a--hole’ that I am talking about in ONE CHAPTER of my book is: Sacha Baron Cohen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for Cohen refuted her claims, telling Fox News Digital, &quot;While we appreciate the importance of speaking out, these demonstrably false claims are directly contradicted by extensive detailed evidence, including contemporaneous documents, film footage, and eyewitness accounts from those present before, during and after the production of &apos;The Brothers Grimsby.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her Sunday Times interview, Wilson said she felt &quot;disrespected on set&quot; and that her weight was used against her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s one thing for someone who is fat to exploit their size for comedy, but it’s another for somebody else to humiliate you,&quot; Wilson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She felt that the costumes purposefully highlighted &quot;all the cellulite on my thighs&quot; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rebel-wilson-responds-accused-fat-phobia-not-including-plus-sizes-new-clothing-line&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;other insecurities&lt;/a&gt; and that she was &quot;something to be laughed at and degraded because of my size.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the outlet, she wrote in her memoir, &quot;I’m sharing my story now because the more women talk about things like this, hopefully the less it happens. And hopefully fewer women have to work harder just to respect themselves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rebel Rising&quot; will be released April 2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Selena Campione, 36, shared her story with Fox News Digital. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/new-jersey-woman-sings-taylor-swift-hits-awake-brain-surgery-eras-tour&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click here to get the story.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults tend to need more medical care as they age, but coordinating that care can be stressful and strenuous for seniors. Doctors discussed the health care challenges older adults face — and what needs to change to improve the situation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/health-care-overwhelmingly-complex-older-adults-experts-increasing-hurdle&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click here to get the story.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s happening more often — busy physicians are turning to chatbots for help in summarizing medical reports. Experts weighed the benefits and the risks of using AI in the health care space. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/more-doctors-use-chatgpt-help-busy-workloads-ai-reliable-assistant&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click here to get the story&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time-restricted eating has been linked to a higher risk of heart-related death in a new study.

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Patricia Richardson is not looking to reprise her role in, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Home Improvement&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; despite rumors from the show&apos;s star and her onscreen husband, Tim Allen, who has suggested otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent conversation on the &quot;Back to the Best&quot; podcast, Richardson was emphatic that she did not want to do a reboot of the 90s sitcom. &quot;It was so weird…I would hear [Tim] was coming out publicly and saying this stuff about how everyone was on board to do a ‘Home Improvement’ reunion,&quot; she remarked. &quot;But he never asked me, and he never asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/home-improvement-star-jonathan-taylor-thomas-seen-publicly-first-time-years-where-cast-is-today&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jonathan [Taylor Thomas&lt;/a&gt;]. Who I talk to.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So I called Jonathan one day and said, &apos;Has he asked you about this? And he went, ‘No.’ And &quot;Why&apos;s he going around telling everybody that we&apos;re all on board when he hasn’t talked to you or me?&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/patricia-richardson-chemistry-tim-allen-home-improvement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PATRICIA RICHARDSON SAYS CHEMISTY WITH TIM ALLEN MADE HER TAKE THE PART ON &apos;HOME IMPROVEMENT&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richardson added that at one point, a rumor online had circulated about a specific script pertaining to her character, matriarch Jill Taylor. &quot;He was kind of lying to people and telling people I was on board and I didn&apos;t know anything about it,&quot; she said of Allen. &quot;So I wrote a big thing on Twitter and said &apos;I&apos;m not involved in any series with Jill and I&apos;ve also never even been asked to do another ‘Home Improvement’ reunion thing. But I would not want to,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I mean, Zach is now a felon,&quot; she said, referencing her onscreen son Zachary Ty Bryan, who has been arrested for a litany of charges including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/actor-zachery-ty-bryan-pleads-guilty-felony-assault-stemming-domestic-violence-arrest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;domestic violence&lt;/a&gt;. In October, he pleaded guilty to felony assault in the fourth degree. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1978, Allen was arrested for possession of cocaine, pleading guilty to felony drug trafficking charges, avoiding a life sentence by giving the names of others involved. He served a little over 2 years before being paroled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Taran [Noah Smith] hasn’t acted since he left the show; he&apos;s not an actor anymore,&quot; Richardson continued of her youngest onscreen son. &quot;And Jonathan&apos;s not really interested in acting. He wants to direct and write. And we don’t have Wilson,&quot; she said referencing late actor Earl Hindman who portrayed the family&apos;s neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s not gonna be the show, at all,&quot; Richardson said of a possible reboot. &quot;And people think we can just magically go right back to who we were 30 years ago. And do a show that was 30 years ago and we&apos;ve all changed quite a bit, I think, since then,&quot; she admitted. &quot;It would be very weird.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think we did it, we did it well, we quit at the right time before it got really bad. And it should just stay as it is,&quot; she suggested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her honesty comes months after initial rumblings of a reboot &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-allen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sparked by Allen&lt;/a&gt; in November. He told the now defunct outlet, The Messenger, as reported by Entertainment Weekly, &quot;I see Richard Karn a lot,&quot; who played Al Borland. &quot;And I talk to the boys and I&apos;m there as one of their friends. We keep talking about [a spinoff].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s funny, one of the conversations we&apos;ve had recently is how weird it would be if &apos;Home Improvement&apos; would be about the kids&apos; kids,&quot; Allen shared. &quot;Like if all of them had children, and I&apos;m a grandparent. &apos;Home Re-Improvement; or something like that. It&apos;s come up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Detroit Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said Saturday he was nearly hit by a car that traveled around Guaranteed Rate Field Thursday during the Chicago White Sox&amp;apos;s festivities.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Thursday marked opening day for baseball, and it nearly turned disastrous for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/detroit-tigers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt; manager A.J. Hinch during his team’s game against the Chicago White Sox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/chicago-white-sox&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;White Sox&lt;/a&gt; decided to bring players out on Guaranteed Rate Field via car. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hinch told reporters Saturday before the second game of the season he was nearly hit by a car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That was a close one,&quot; Hinch said, via MLive.com. &quot;They have priority. Clearly. I&apos;ll let the cars pass next time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photos on social media showed the cars traveling around the warning track and down the third base line. It wasn’t clear just how close the vehicles got to Hinch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tigers have gotten off to a hot start to 2024 with two straight wins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/yankees-sweat-through-new-nike-uniforms-prompting-backlash-a-disgrace&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YANKEES SWEAT THROUGH NEW NIKE UNIFORMS, PROMPTING BACKLASH: &apos;A DISGRACE&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Carson Kelly hit a run-scoring single in the seventh inning and the 10th inning to help Detroit defeat Chicago 7-6 in extras. Mark Canha and Riley Greene also homered during the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We want to play for bigger things. We want to go to the playoffs, and we want to go win,&quot; Kelly said after the game. &quot;Obviously, to get there, you&apos;ve got to win ... these close games, and I think that&apos;s what we&apos;re going to go out and show.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hinch is in his fourth season with the Tigers. He guided Detroit to an improvement in 2023 from 2022 with a record of 78-84.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s 481-329 during his career after managing the Arizona Diamondbacks and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/houston-astros&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt; earlier in his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>3 months and 28 days: LGBTQ events clog calendar as White House faces backlash over Easter announcement</title>
                    
                    <description>The U.S. celebrates dozens of LGBT holidays and weeks, data shows, including the White House proclaiming Transgender Day of Visibility on Easter Sunday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amid backlash &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;about the White House proclaiming&lt;/a&gt; Transgender Day of Visibility on Easter Sunday, Fox News Digital found an extensive list of LGBT-focused holidays celebrated throughout the year, including a handful recognized by the White House. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On Transgender Day of Visibility, we honor the extraordinary courage and contributions of transgender Americans and reaffirm our Nation’s commitment to forming a more perfect Union — where all people are created equal and treated equally throughout their lives,&quot; said a White House statement recognizing Transgender Day of Visibility on Easter Sunday, the most holy holiday for Christians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today, we send a message to all transgender Americans: You are loved. You are heard. You are understood. You belong. You are America, and my entire Administration and I have your back,&quot; it added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now, therefore, I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 31, 2024, as Transgender Day of Visibility.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-slammed-social-media-announcing-transgender-day-visibility-easter-sunday&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN SLAMMED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER ANNOUNCING TRANSGENDER DAY OF VISIBILITY ON EASTER SUNDAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservatives and other critics of the White House ripped the decision to recognize Transgender Day of Visibility on Easter, calling it an attack on Christianity. International Transgender Day of Visibility was created by activists more than 10 years ago and is celebrated each year on March 31, while the date of Easter Sunday changes from year to year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/americans-arent-buying-bidens-devout-catholic-label-poll-finds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;AMERICANS AREN&apos;T BUYING BIDEN&apos;S &apos;DEVOUT CATHOLIC&apos; LABEL, POLL FINDS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump campaign called on Biden to apologize for the proclamation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;We call on Joe Biden&apos;s failing&lt;/a&gt; campaign and the White House to issue an apology to the millions of Catholics and Christians across America who believe tomorrow is for one celebration only — the resurrection of Jesus Christ,&quot; Karoline Leavitt said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-skewered-worlds-worst-catholic-cheapens-irish-catholic-identity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN SKEWERED AS &apos;WORLD’S WORST CATHOLIC&apos; WHO CHEAPENS IRISH AND CATHOLIC IDENTITY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/social-media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that cities, universities, LGBT organizations and government officials celebrate similar calendar events throughout the year. Fox News Digital found at least 28 other related holidays celebrated in the U.S., including International Asexuality Day, International Day of Pink, Day of Silence, Harvey Milk Day, Pansexual and Panromantic Awareness Day and International Drag Day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also entire months devoted to LGBT causes or commemorations, including Pride Month in June, LGBT History Month in October and Transgender Awareness Month in November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every holiday throughout the year is recognized by the White House or high-ranking lawmakers, but holidays are celebrated by advocacy groups in cities such as Seattle or on college campuses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden White House has celebrated at least seven other holidays celebrating and commemorating LGBT issues, including National Coming Out Day in October; Lesbian Day of Visibility in April; International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia in May; Pride Month in June; Spirit Day in October; Intersex Awareness Day in October; and Transgender Day of Remembrance in November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has celebrated Transgender Day of Visibility each year since 2021 on March 31, and White House spokesman Andrew Bates said Biden, as a Christian, is working to bring &quot;people together&quot; with the event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a Christian who celebrates Easter with family, President Biden stands for bringing people together and upholding the dignity and freedoms of every American,&quot; Bates said in comment to Fox News Digital on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-doubles-down-inclusiveness-message-backlash-transgender-day-visibility-easter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHITE HOUSE DOUBLES DOWN ON INCLUSIVENESS MESSAGE AMID BACKLASH OVER TRANSGENDER DAY OF VISIBILITY ON EASTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sadly, it’s unsurprising politicians are seeking to divide and weaken our country with cruel, hateful and dishonest rhetoric. President Biden will never abuse his faith for political purposes or for profit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden, who is Catholic, did post a message Sunday celebrating Easter and Jesus’ resurrection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jill and I send our warmest wishes to Christians around the world celebrating the power of hope and the promise of Christ’s Resurrection this Easter Sunday,&quot; he posted Sunday morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has a long history promoting and supporting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/diversity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the LGBT community, including last year&lt;/a&gt; when the president hosted the White House’s largest Pride celebration in its history, according to Reuters. Biden has repeatedly vowed to combat discrimination against the gay community and spoke in support of the trans community during his State of the Union address earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House has previously come under fire from critics during events heralding the LGBT community, including last year when a transgender model and activist took off her top at a Pride event at the White House and cupped her breasts in photos and for inviting an anti-police nonbinary drag queen to attend the Respect for Marriage Act signing in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans have continued hammering the Biden administration online for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/occasions/holiday&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;celebrating the holiday on the same&lt;/a&gt; day as Easter. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As thousands of Pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in Times Square earlier in the day for &quot;Palestinian Land Day,&quot; they took their protest to the Easter Vigil service &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;at St. Patrick&apos;s cathedral in New York City&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/roman-catholic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;During the second reading,&lt;/a&gt; chants of &quot;Free, free Palestine&quot; could be heard ringing out during the service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protesters were quickly taken out of the service moments after, as many in attendance did not acknowledge the outburst. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/roman-catholic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The mass was led by Cardinal Timothy Dolan,&lt;/a&gt; archbishop of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-demands-biden-issue-apology-over-blasphemous-trans-visibility-day-easter-sunday-appalling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP DEMANDS BIDEN TO ISSUE APOLOGY OVER &apos;BLASPHEMOUS&apos; TRANS VISIBILITY DAY ON EASTER SUNDAY: &apos;APPALLING&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All over the world, millions gathered Saturday to protest the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) issued a call for prayer for peace in the Middle East and an end to the Israel-Hamas war in a statement before the start of Holy Week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/us-catholic-bishops-request-prayers-peace-israel-ahead-holy-week&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US CATHOLIC BISHOPS REQUEST PRAYERS FOR PEACE IN ISRAEL AHEAD OF HOLY WEEK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/lent-and-life&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;As the Church enters Holy Week&lt;/a&gt; and Christ’s suffering on the cross and his resurrection are made present to us so vividly, we are connected to the very source of hope,&quot; the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the war in Israel, the USCCB has consistently issued calls for peace, prayer, fasting and the release of hostages captured by Hamas. The conference has also decried the deaths of civilians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thousands of innocent people have died in this conflict, and thousands more have been displaced and face tremendous suffering,&quot; the bishops said. &quot;This must stop.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Christine Rousselle and Pilar Arias contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

He played in 18 games for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/green-bay-packers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; between 2019 and 2020, catching 21 passes for 114 yards and a touchdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufl-kicker-praises-god-drilling-game-winning-64-yard-field-goal-first-attempt-since-high-school&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UFL KICKER PRAISES GOD AFTER DRILLING GAME-WINNING 64-YARD FIELD GOAL IN FIRST ATTEMPT SINCE HIGH SCHOOL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He joined the Stallions during the team’s first season in the USFL and stayed for a second stint in 2023.

Sternberger had two catches for 32 yards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tackles throughout the sport have come under fire. While the NFL didn’t address low tackling technique, owners agreed to outlaw the hip-drop tackle with the swivel motion. NFL defenders and the NFLPA disagreed with the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>New York Mets pitcher Yohan Ramirez and manager Carlos Mendoza were suspended over an incident in Saturday&amp;apos;s game against the Milwaukee Brewers.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Major League Baseball suspended New York Mets pitcher Yohan Ramirez and manager Carlos Mendoza Sunday after an incident in a game with Milwaukee Brewers star &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/rhys-hoskins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rhys Hoskins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez threw behind Hoskins during Saturday’s game, adding another chapter in the feud between the slugger and the Mets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pitch came after Hoskins had hit a home run and singled, and it stemmed from a hard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tensions-boil-mets-brewers-opening-day-game-rhys-hoskins-slide-jeff-mcneil&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;slide he made&lt;/a&gt; into Mets second baseman Jeff McNeil Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even Mets broadcaster Ron Darling criticized the pitch, saying &quot;the message was about two hours late.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident with Ramirez and Hoskins was enough for MLB to lay down the law. The announcement came more than an hour before New York’s series finale against Milwaukee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Big leaguers don’t miss by eight feet,&quot; Hoskins said. &quot;Whether or not it was on purpose or not, that’s not for me to decide. I really don’t care. But this game has had a way of policing itself for many, many, many years. So, let’s focus on doing it the right way if we’re going to do that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/blue-jays-genesis-cabreras-shoves-rays-jose-caballero-sparking-benches-clearing-confrontation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BLUE JAYS&apos; GÉNESIS CABRERA&apos;S SHOVES RAYS&apos; JOSÉ CABALLERO, SPARKING BENCHES-CLEARING CONFRONTATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brewers manager Pat Murphy didn’t think the pitch was intentional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There’s a history there, and we had an altercation the day before and one goes over his head — albeit, I bet it wasn’t on purpose,&quot; Murphy said. &quot;I didn’t suggest they throw him out of the game. I just said, ‘Hey man, we’ve got to take hold of this. I don’t want people getting hurt.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/new-york-mets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Mets&lt;/a&gt; in the offseason after appearing in 31 games with the Pittsburgh Pirates and Chicago White Sox in 2023. He is appealing the suspension, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2024/03/31/sports/mets-carlos-mendoza-yohan-ramirez-suspended-for-throw-at-rhys-hoskins/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mendoza is in his first season as Mets manager after he was named the replacement for Buck Showalter. He’s only managed two games and will now miss what would have been his third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York will try to avoid a sweep Sunday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/state-department&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Antony Blinken&lt;/a&gt; became the latest Biden administration official to mark Transgender Day of Visibility, which has sparked controversy for being celebrated the same day as Easter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Transgender Day of Visibility is a celebration of the courage and resilience of transgender, nonbinary and gender non-confirming persons who exist in every country and culture around the world,&quot; Blinken said in a statement Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On this day, the United States recognizes the achievements and progress that trans persons have made in the global struggle for equality and re-affirms its commitment to supporting the equality, inclusion and full recognition of the human rights of transgender persons.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement comes after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt; sparked backlash with a similar statement Friday, marking Sunday as a day to &quot;honor the extraordinary courage and contributions of transgender Americans.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-demands-biden-issue-apology-over-blasphemous-trans-visibility-day-easter-sunday-appalling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP DEMANDS BIDEN ISSUE APOLOGY OVER &apos;BLASPHEMOUS&apos; TRANS VISIBILITY DAY ON EASTER SUNDAY: &apos;APPALLING&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservatives on social media questioned the timing of the White House celebration, noting the day falls on Easter Sunday, one of the holiest days of the Christian calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Biden White House has betrayed the central tenet of Easter — which is the resurrection of Jesus Christ,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mike-johnson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;House Speaker Mike Johnson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said on X. &quot;Banning sacred truth and tradition—while at the same time proclaiming Easter Sunday as &apos;Transgender Day&apos;—is outrageous and abhorrent. The American people are taking note.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am absolutely disgusted that Joe Biden has declared the most Holy of Holy days — a self proclaimed devout Catholic — as Transgender Day of Visibility,&quot; former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete Caitlyn Jenner said. &quot;The only thing you should be declaring on this day is ‘HE is Risen’.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House celebration also earned the scorn of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;former President Trump&lt;/a&gt;, and Trump&apos;s national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, called on Biden to issue an apology for the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-slammed-social-media-announcing-transgender-day-visibility-easter-sunday&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN SLAMMED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER ANNOUNCING TRANSGENDER DAY OF VISIBILITY ON EASTER SUNDAY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We call on Joe Biden&apos;s failing campaign and the White House to issue an apology to the millions of Catholics and Christians across America who believe (Sunday) is for one celebration only — the resurrection of Jesus Christ,&quot; Leavitt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Blinken&apos;s statement, the secretary of state noted that &quot;trans persons face violence, suppression, and infringements on their human rights and fundamental freedoms&quot; in other parts of the world, but he argued the United States is urging &quot;partners around the globe to work with the United States in fighting for a world in which transgender persons are free to live safely and openly as themselves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House argued the celebration always falls on March 31 and that Easter is not always the same day, and it issued a statement in response Saturday, calling the backlash over its celebration of the day divisive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/christianity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;As a Christian&lt;/a&gt; who celebrates Easter with family, President Biden stands for bringing people together and upholding the dignity and freedoms of every American,&quot; the statement said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sadly, it’s unsurprising politicians are seeking to divide and weaken our country with cruel, hateful and dishonest rhetoric. President Biden will never abuse his faith for political purposes or for profit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reached for comment, a State Department spokesperson referred Fox News Digital the White House statement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Former ESPN host Sage Steele accidentally addressed UFC president Dana White as podcast host Joe Rogan on Thursday at the very end of an interview.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former ESPN host Sage Steele mistakenly addressed UFC president Dana White as podcast host Joe Rogan during an interview on Steele&apos;s podcast on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White sat down with Steele during an appearance on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNKRKs-UegA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Sage Steele Podcast,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and at the very end of the interview, the host asked White, &quot;What is Joe Rogan&apos;s dream?&quot; White repeated the question as Steele corrected herself and said, &quot;Joe Rogan. Dana White.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Did you just think that was Joe Rogan?&quot; White said. Steele admitted, &quot;I totally did.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She just called me f-----g Joe Rogan. You thought I was f-----g Joe Rogan?!&quot; he asked. &quot;I was bald before Joe Rogan was ever bald. White said fans often mistake him for Rogan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufcs-dana-white-delivers-pro-freedom-response-being-asked-sean-stricklands-tirade&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;UFC&apos;S DANA WHITE DELIVERS PRO-FREEDOM RESPONSE AFTER BEING ASKED ABOUT SEAN STRICKLAND&apos;S TIRADE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I just did a two-hour f-----g podcast, I just flew here from Vegas, and she thought she was interviewing Joe Rogan,&quot; he cracked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jesus, Jesus,&quot; Steele continued. White quipped that &quot;all us White, bald guys look alike.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steele also referred to White as &quot;Joe&quot; earlier in the interview, but the two didn&apos;t address it at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufcs-dana-white-abruptly-quits-howie-mandel-show-little-explanation-f-ing-tired-doing-podcasts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;White abruptly stormed&lt;/a&gt; off the set of Howie Mandel’s podcast in February and said he was &quot;so f-----g tired of doing podcasts.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/joe-rogan-suggests-one-biggest-problems-biden-administration-staff-ridiculous&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOE ROGAN SUGGESTS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS THE STAFF: ‘SO RIDICULOUS’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the &quot;Howie Mandel Does Stuff&quot; podcast, Mandel introduced the UFC president and said he was an &quot;amazing guy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the introduction, White said he was done with podcasts before pushing the mic away and eventually walking off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thank you for all the kind words, I appreciate it. I am so f-----g tired of doing podcasts. It’s—I&apos;m literally done with them. I&apos;m not doing any more podcasts,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White also posted a clip of the exchange with Steele to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;social media.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandel walked in on the two at the end of the interview and joked that Steele also referred to him as Joe Rogan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandel praised both Steele and White at the very end of the clip and said the interview was inspiring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Paulina Dedaj contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>LSU women&amp;apos;s basketball head coach Kim Mulkey ripped the Los Angeles Times Saturday over a column taking shots at Tigers players with critical descriptions.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/lsu-tigers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;LSU women’s basketball&lt;/a&gt; coach Kim Mulkey and the Tigers were the subject of a Los Angeles Times column that described players as &quot;villains&quot; and &quot;dirty debutantes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mulkey, who had been critical of The Washington Post in the days leading up to a profile by the newspaper, shredded the LA Times over the column. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She derided it as &quot;sexist,&quot; &quot;awful&quot; and &quot;wrong.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You can criticize coaches all you want,&quot; she told reporters, via ESPN. &quot;That&apos;s our business. You can come at us and say you&apos;re the worst coach in America. I hate you, I hate everything about you. We expect that. It comes with the territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But the one thing I&apos;m not going to let you do, I&apos;m not going to let you attack young people, and there were some things in this commentary that you should be offended by as women. It was so sexist. It was good versus evil in that game today. Evil? Called us dirty debutantes? Are you kidding me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m not going to let you talk about 18- to 21-year-old kids in that tone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LSU star &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lsus-angel-reese-says-fiery-handshake-incident-started-bruins-assistant-coach-talking-little-crazy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Angel Reese&lt;/a&gt; was among the players who came out in defense of Mulkey over the LA Times piece. She said she and her teammates are &quot;good villains&quot; who are helping the game of women’s basketball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/caitlin-clarks-strong-performance-lifts-iowa-to-elite-8-setups-rematch-with-defending-champion-lsu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAITLIN CLARK&apos;S STRONG PERFORMANCE LIFTS IOWA TO ELITE 8, SETS UP REMATCH WITH DEFENDING CHAMPION LSU&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That’s what we’re worried about,&quot; Reese said. &quot;Just being able to have teammates that have my back, have teammates, have coaches just have each other’s back this whole time. I don’t care what the outside thinks. I know what’s going on in that locker room.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mulkey added she wasn’t going to let &quot;sexism continue.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But I can&apos;t sit up here as a mother and a grandmother and a leader of young people and allow somebody to say that. Because guys, that&apos;s wrong. I know sexism when I see it and I read it. That was awful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LA Times has since edited its story to remove some language, including &quot;dirty debutantes.&quot; The newspaper said it didn’t meet its &quot;editorial standards.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criticism of the LA Times column came as The Washington Post released a story on Mulkey, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lsus-kim-mulkey-shrugs-off-piece-released-ahead-of-sweet-16-profiling-rifts-during-career-havent-read-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;detailing rifts&lt;/a&gt; during her career with players and her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can tell you I haven&apos;t read it. I don&apos;t know that I will read it. I&apos;ll leave that up to my attorneys,&quot; she said of the Post profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be unconscious as he undergoes hernia surgery under full anesthesia at a hospital Sunday night.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;diagnosed with a hernia&lt;/a&gt; and will undergo surgery Sunday night, the prime minister’s office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hernia was diagnosed during a routine checkup Saturday night, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/benjamin-netanyahu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Netanyahu&apos;s office&lt;/a&gt; revealed. After Netanyahu consulted with his doctors, it was decided the best way forward was to surgically repair the hernia at a hospital Sunday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operation will be performed under full anesthesia, and Netanyahu will be unconscious during the procedure, the office said. During this time, Yariv Levin, deputy prime minister and minister of justice, will be the acting prime minister of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No further details about Netanyahu’s diagnosis were immediately provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/bidens-shifting-support-israel-own-words-unwavering-criticism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN&apos;S SHIFTING SUPPORT OF ISRAEL IN HIS OWN WORDS: FROM ‘UNWAVERING’ TO ‘OVER THE TOP’ CRITICISM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors for the 74-year-old have said he is in good health, and he has kept a full schedule throughout Israel&apos;s nearly six-month war against Hamas. Last year, Netanyahu underwent surgery to have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-undergo-surgery-pacemaker-implantation-health-scare&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;pacemaker implanted&lt;/a&gt; following a health scare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Netanyahu canceled a delegation of top Israeli officials&apos; trip to Washington after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; administration did not veto a U.N. resolution calling for a cease-fire in Gaza and setting a condition that Hamas release all hostages first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/critics-charge-biden-abandoning-israel-hostages-growing-tensions-jewish-state&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRITICS CHARGE BIDEN WITH ABANDONING ISRAEL, HOSTAGES AMID GROWING TENSIONS WITH JEWISH STATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Israeli leader&lt;/a&gt; issued an ultimatum to the U.S., warning that he would cancel the meeting if the U.S. did not veto Monday&apos;s U.N. resolution. The U.S. abstained rather than vetoing, allowing the resolution to pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration insists its support for Israel has not changed since the Hamas terror attack Oct. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Anders Hagstrom contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Tim Tebow and wife Demi-Leigh are joining forces with a second-chance employer to bring hope and second chances to those with criminal records.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former NFL quarterback &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6341602795112&quot;&gt;Tim Tebow and wife Demi-Leigh&lt;/a&gt; are lending some star power to one of the country&apos;s largest second-chance employers in America in hopes of giving ex-convicts hope of getting back on their feet after being released from prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cincinnati-based Nehemiah Manufacturing says its purpose is to &quot;build brands, create jobs and change lives,&quot; particularly for those who have criminal records, by enabling them to contribute to the success of brands like Tide, Downy and Febreeze. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tebow says it&apos;s a lesson in &quot;grace.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tim-tebow-talks-fight-against-one-of-the-worst-evils-world&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIM TEBOW TALKS FIGHT AGAINST ‘ONE OF THE WORST EVILS IN THE WORLD’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Their heart for people is what shines, and the people are what shine. That&apos;s what it&apos;s all about,&quot; Tebow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, it&apos;s a manufacturing company, and they do an incredible job with everyday products that all of us use in an incredible way. But what&apos;s special about it is that people and why we should believe in second chances is because Grace gave us all a second chance first, and we need to so believe in giving people a second and a third and a fifth and an eleven-teenth chance. Because that&apos;s what Grace is all about.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appearing on &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/shows/fox-friends-weekend&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends Weekend&lt;/a&gt;&quot; on Easter Sunday, the couple shared their message of love, hope and redemption – qualities they find in Nehemiah&apos;s work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/jesus-christs-resurrection-means-all-road-emmaus-texas-pastor&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JESUS CHRIST&apos;S RESURRECTION MEANS WE ARE ALL ON THE ‘ROAD TO EMMAUS,’ SAYS TEXAS PASTOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demi-Leigh said the purpose is to give people the opportunity to write their &quot;comeback story,&quot; and elaborated more on how that goal is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They have eight pillars that they use to walk alongside all of their employees, to come alongside them, to help them to be able to write that comeback story,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They provide financial support, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;continued education&lt;/a&gt;, things to the extent of affordable housing to their employees… when we look at Jesus&apos;s story, when, as believers, we see what he has done for us, especially on a day like today [Easter Sunday] how can we not but want to come alongside people and support them the way that we are supported?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6349816592112&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WYNDHAM CLARK, TEEN HEART TRANSPLANT RECIPIENT SHARE INSPIRING MESSAGE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://local12.com/news/local/tim-tebow-wife-demi-signs-multi-year-agreement-partnership-second-chance-cincinnati-company-nehemiah-manufacturer-jail-prison-inmates-released-turnover-criminal-records-kristen-schumacher-dan-meyer-industry-rehabilitation-mission-goals-faith-football&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;WKRC-TV in Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;, the prison policy initiative indicates that Ohio releases nearly 416,000 men and women from prisons and jails every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same report also states that nearly 70% of Nehemiah&apos;s workforce holds a criminal record and the company boasts an annual turnover rate of 15% compared to the nearly 40% average seen elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re so grateful… for the difference [they] are making for the second chances, for the way they&apos;re showing love to individuals that so desperately need it,&quot; Tebow said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Hochul echoes WH with New York Transgender Day of Visibility on Easter, orders landmarks lit for occasion</title>
                    
                    <description>Thirteen landmarks in New York will be lit Sunday in observance of International Transgender Day of Visibility, which happens to fall on Easter this year.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The state of New York will have 13 landmarks lit in celebration of Transgender Day of Visibility Sunday, joining the White House in observation of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One World Trade Center, the Empire State Plaza and Niagara Falls are just a few of the locations that &quot;will be lit light pink, white and light blue,&quot; a press release from the office of Gov. Kathy Hochul states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am proud of the strength transgender New Yorkers display every day and want to make one thing clear: You are always welcome in New York. You are loved,&quot; Hochul said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Events scheduled around the world include panels and speakers in Cincinnati and Atlanta, marches in Melbourne and Philadelphia and an inclusive roller derby league game on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York&apos;s Long Island.&lt;/a&gt; A picnic is planned in the English town of Hitchin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-demands-biden-issue-apology-over-blasphemous-trans-visibility-day-easter-sunday-appalling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP DEMANDS BIDEN ISSUE APOLOGY OVER &apos;BLASPHEMOUS&apos; TRANS VISIBILITY DAY ON EASTER SUNDAY: &apos;APPALLING&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the highest-profile U.S. event is a rally scheduled for Sunday on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;President Biden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was slammed on social media Saturday after marking Easter Sunday, the most solemn Christian holiday, &quot;Transgender Day of Visibility.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-slammed-social-media-announcing-transgender-day-visibility-easter-sunday&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN SLAMMED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER ANNOUNCING TRANSGENDER DAY OF VISIBILITY ON EASTER SUNDAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While March 31 has been designated to honor the transgender movement in the U.S. since Biden took office and internationally since 2009, this year it falls on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/christianity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Easter Sunday,&lt;/a&gt; one of the most important days for Christians celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On Transgender Day of Visibility, we honor the extraordinary courage and contributions of transgender Americans and reaffirm our Nation’s commitment to forming a more perfect Union — where all people are created equal and treated equally throughout their lives,&quot; a statement released by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the White House&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6350039090112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HUCKABEE SLAMS BIDEN FOR RECOGNIZING &apos;TRANS VISIBILITY DAY&apos; ON EASTER SUNDAY: &apos;GONE TO LA LA LAND&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Transgender persons deserve to live authentically, safely and with dignity,&quot; Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement released Easter Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Transgender Day of Visibility was first organized in 2009 by Rachel Crandall-Crocker, the executive director and co-founder of Transgender Michigan, according to The Associated Press. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think that once a person understands us, it’s hard to discriminate against us,&quot; she said in an interview. &quot;I created it because I wanted a time that we don’t have to be so lonely. I wanted a day that we’re all together all over the world as one community. And that’s exactly what we are.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Haley Chi-Sing, Anders Hagstrom and the Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kansas City Chiefs&lt;/a&gt; wide receiver Rashee Rice is reportedly wanted in connection with a &quot;major&quot; crash that occurred in Dallas Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement officials told The Dallas Morning News Sunday a vehicle either registered or leased to the Super Bowl champion was involved in a crash on the North Central Expressway at around 6:20 p.m. local time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice’s alleged involvement in the crash wasn’t clear. He didn’t appear in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Dallas County Jail&lt;/a&gt; records as of 10:20 a.m. ET Sunday morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dallas Police told Fox News Digital that officers were called to a multi-vehicle accident on the expressway. Police said a preliminary investigation determined two drivers — one in a Corvette and one in a Lamborghini — were speeding in the left lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drivers lost control of their vehicles, and the Lamborghini traveled onto the shoulder and hit the center median wall, causing a chain-reaction collision involving four other vehicles, six in total, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The occupants in the Lamborghini and Corvette fled without stopping to see whether anyone needed help or providing information, police said. Two drivers involved in the crash were treated, and two others were taken to a hospital for minor injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police were still investigating the crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear which vehicle Rice was in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 23-year-old was born in Philadelphia but grew up in North Richland Hills in Texas. He played high school football in Richland and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/smu-mustangs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;attended SMU&lt;/a&gt;, where he played four years. He recorded 1,355 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns in 12 games during his senior year in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfl-draft-prospect-jayden-daniels-puts-elbow-concerns-rest-strange-photo-goes-viral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NFL DRAFT PROSPECT JAYDEN DANIELS PUTS ELBOW CONCERNS TO REST AFTER STRANGE PHOTO GOES VIRAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansas City selected Rice in the third round of the 2023 draft, and he quickly became a top target for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/patrick-mahomes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Patrick Mahomes-led&lt;/a&gt; offense his rookie season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had 79 catches for 938 yards and seven touchdowns and helped the Chiefs win their second consecutive Super Bowl title in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 25-22 Super Bowl victory over the San Francisco 49ers, Rice had six catches for 39 yards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither the Chiefs nor Rice’s representative responded to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>WATCH: Woman falls through floor as possible sinkhole opens up under shopping mall</title>
                    
                    <description>Video from security cameras caught the moment when the floor collapsed on the second floor of a shopping center due to a possible sinkhole damaging the ground floor.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Video captured the moment last weekend when a woman casually shopping in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chinese department store&lt;/a&gt; disappeared as a possible sinkhole swallowed a portion of the floor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A construction worker on the first floor of a shopping mall in the city of Zhenjiang in Jiangsu, China, told local outlets a sinkhole opened up, trapping him and causing the floor above to collapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video, a woman was walking around on the second story of a shopping mall in Zhenjiang when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/disasters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the floor caved in&lt;/a&gt;, toppling two clothing racks as the woman fell through the hole. A second woman, wearing a yellow jacket, ran away from the hole before stopping to go back and check on the other woman, according to Newsflare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Huang, a representative of the mall, told reporters both people suffered only minor injuries. Emergency crews and firefighters responded immediately and helped rescue both of the victims before cleaning up the damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/could-protective-barriers-prevented-baltimore-bridge-collapse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COULD PROTECTIVE BARRIERS HAVE PREVENTED BALTIMORE BRIDGE COLLAPSE?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As they are our customers, we, as the responsible party, have been actively handling the aftermath and providing necessary assistance,&quot; Huang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The construction worker suffered a leg injury from falling debris, while the shopper suffered fractures, Australian news outlet ABC reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/tnt-blast-kills-2-polish-military-engineers-training-exercise&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TNT BLAST KILLS 2 POLISH MILITARY ENGINEERS DURING TRAINING EXERCISE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City officials have launched an investigation into the incident to determine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/2601521513001&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;what caused the damage&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is no stranger to sinkholes. A giant one opened once up in an ancient forest in Guangxi Zhuang. The hole measured 1,000 feet in length, 490 feet in width and nearly 630 feet in depth. Experts determined the sinkhole had three cave entrances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/3-killed-several-missing-incident-migrant-boat-southeastern-spain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 KILLED, SEVERAL MISSING AFTER INCIDENT INVOLVING MIGRANT BOAT OFF SOUTHEASTERN SPAIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sinkhole&apos;s bottom is lined with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-sinkhole-discovered-forest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;well-preserved primitive forest,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; according to the local news agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinkholes can form when the ground is worn away, either due to composition — such as limestone, a porous rock that easily dissolves in water — from a loss of groundwater that causes air pockets to form or from acid rainwater eating away at bedrock. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Police in Honduras announced the arrest of American citizen Gilbert Reyes Bermúdez for allegedly killing three women on the tourist island of the country.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Police in Honduras announced that American citizen Gilbert Reyes Bermúdez was arrested in the Dominican Republic for allegedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;killing three women&lt;/a&gt; in the Honduran island of Roatán.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 36-year-old suspect is accused of killing María Antonia Cruz, Nikendra McCoy and Dione Solórzano after going out with them on Jan. 6. The following day, Reyes Bermúdez was accused of fleeing Honduras and the women were reported missing. Their bodies were found with gunshot wounds in a vehicle three days later, the Costa Rica newspaper Tico Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the victims, Solórzano, is reportedly Reyes&apos; ex-partner, according to the publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reyes Bermúdez arrived in the Dominican Republic on March 16, according to the online newspaper Dominican Today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/prominent-bahamas-politician-killed-robbery-attempt-nassau&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROMINENT BAHAMAS POLITICIAN KILLED DURING ROBBERY ATTEMPT NEAR NASSAU&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dominican newspaper Dominican Today reported that authorities seized $205 and 600 pesos in cash from Reyes Bermudez, as well has his American passport, two cell phones, and other personal items including documents, keys, glasses, and a wallet, which were then being held by OCN-Interpol Santo Domingo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process to extradite Reyes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/regions/central-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;back to Honduras&lt;/a&gt; has begun, National Police of Honduras announced on Facebook. Crime scene evidence and witness testimony will be used in the case against him, the Honduran government said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Central American country has the highest rate of femicide, the intentional murder of women, among Latin American countries, and the fifth highest in the world, according to the Tico Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/british-court-rules-julian-assange-extradition-pause-us-guarantees-no-death-penalty-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BRITISH COURT RULES JULIAN ASSANGE EXTRADITION ON PAUSE UNTIL US GUARANTEES NO DEATH PENALTY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News reached out to the U.S. Department of State for comment regarding Reyes arrest but did not immediately hear back. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
