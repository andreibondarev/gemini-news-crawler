                    <title>Stephen Strasburg retires from MLB after spending entire career with Nationals</title>
                    
                    <description>Stephen Strasburg officially announced his retirement from baseball on Sunday after spending his entire career with the Washington Nationals.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stephen Strasburg, a World Series champion pitcher for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/washington-nationals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Washington Nationals&lt;/a&gt; whose last few seasons in baseball were marred by injuries, announced his retirement on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLB officially listed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/stephen-strasburg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Strasburg’s retirement&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a young kid, all I dreamt about was winning a World Series. Thanks to the many coaches, teammates and medical staff, my boyhood dream came true in 2019,&quot; Strasburg said. &quot;Despite this being a personal goal of mine. I’ve come to realize how truly important and special that moment was for so many fans in the DMW. Your unwavering support through the ups and downs will always mean the world to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’d also like to thank the late Ted Lerner and family for giving me the chance to wear the curly ‘W’ all these years. Although I will always wish there were more games to be pitched. I find comfort knowing I left it all out there for the only team I’ve known. My family and I are truly fortunate and blessed to have experienced this baseball journey in the Nation’s Capitol.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nationals selected Strasburg No. 1 overall out of San Diego State. He burst onto the scene in 2010, striking out 92 batters in 12 games and posting a 2.91 ERA. But he missed most of 2011 recovering from Tommy John surgery, which he underwent at the end of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He helped the Nationals to a World Series title in 2019. He struck out 14 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/houston-astros&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt; batters and recorded a 2.51 ERA in two starts. He was named World Series MVP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Strasburg made two starts in the shortened season but suffered from nerve issues in his hand. Injuries again kept him off the mound for a majority of the end of his career. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bizarre-snowstorm-showers-pirates-home-opener-vs-orioles-pnc-park&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIZARRE SNOWSTORM SHOWERS OVER PIRATES&apos; HOME OPENER VS ORIOLES AT PNC PARK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He finished with 1,723 strikeouts and a 3.24 career ERA. He was a three-time All-Star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On behalf of the Lerner-Cohen-Tanenbaum family, I’d like to thank Stephen for all he’s done for the Washington Nationals,&quot; Nationals principal owner Mark D. Lerner said. &quot;It was a privilege to watch him grow as a player and a person throughout his illustrious career. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He gave us so many memories that will live in our hearts forever. No one can dispute the indelible impact he had on our organization. He put us on the map as World Champions and changed the face of our franchise. Thank you, Stephen – for everything – and congratulations on a tremendous career.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Rizzo, the team’s GM and president of baseball operations, added: &quot;I’d like to congratulate Stephen on an incredible career. From his Major League debut in 2010 through leading us to a title as the World Series MVP in 2019, the impact he’s had on our ball club is undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He will go down as one of the best players in Washington Nationals history, and it was my honor to be part of that journey. We’re thankful for all he’s done for our organization and wish him and his family the absolute best.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Pitch clock to blame for pitchers&apos; elbow injuries, MLBPA exec says</title>
                    
                    <description>MLB Players Association executive Tony Clark put the blame on the pitch clock for the reason why some of the league&amp;apos;s top pitchers have suffered elbow injuries.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Major League Baseball’s&lt;/a&gt; two top pitching stars – the Cleveland Guardians’ Shane Bieber and the Atlanta Braves’ Spencer Strider – were among those who suffered elbow injuries within the first few days of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, the New York Yankees’ Jonathan Loaisiga, the Miami Marlins’ Eury Perez and the Oakland Athletics’ Trevor Gott also suffered elbow injuries. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/gerrit-cole&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Gerrit Cole&lt;/a&gt; was forced to miss the first few months of the season with an elbow problem as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Clark, executive director of the MLB Players Association, put the onus on the pitch clock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Despite unanimous player opposition and significant concerns regarding health and safety, the commissioner’s office reduced the length of the pitch clock last December, just one season removed from imposing the most significant rule change in decades,&quot; Clark said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Since then, our concerns about the health impacts of reduced recovery time have only intensified. The league’s unwillingness thus far to acknowledge or study the effects of these profound changes is an unprecedented threat to our game and its most valuable asset – the players.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/former-mlb-all-star-jj-hardy-catches-heat-neighbors-starting-construction-backyard-field&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORMER MLB ALL-STAR J.J. HARDY CATCHES HEAT FROM NEIGHBORS AFTER STARTING CONSTRUCTION ON BACKYARD FIELD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLB cited analysis by Johns Hopkins in its response to the MLBPA. It said the researchers &quot;found no evidence to support that the introduction of the pitch clock has increased injuries&quot; and &quot;no evidence that pitchers who worked quickly... or sped up their pace were more likely to sustain an injury than those who did not.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This statement ignores the empirical evidence and much more significant long-term trend, over multiple decades, of velocity and spin increases that are highly correlated with arm injuries,&quot; MLB added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pitch clock was instituted before the 2023 season. Pitchers had 15 seconds to fire the ball in with nobody on base and 20 seconds when there’s a base runner. The 20 seconds was reduced to 18 by the league&apos;s competition committee, which the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mlb-union-rips-decision-to-shorten-pitch-clock-time-says-players-expressed-concerns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;union strongly opposed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLB hoped it would help shorten games and it did. A nine-inning game’s average time dropped to 2 hours and 40 minutes – a 24-minute decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Smoking cigarettes can destroy lungs, but shocking new study reveals why vaping can harm the heart</title>
                    
                    <description>Dr. Nicole Saphier warned of the possible side effects of long-term e-cigarette usage as a new study reveals vaping leads to increased risk of heart failure.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The American College of Cardiology has some bad news for e-cigarette users after a new study found that those who vape are 19% more likely to develop &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt; compared to their non-vaping counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used data from a National Institutes of Health (NIH) study, including surveys and electronic health records, to assess potential correlations between heart failure diagnoses and e-cigarette use in over 175,000 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results found that over 3,200 participants developed heart failure within a median follow-up time of 45 months, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acc.org/About-ACC/Press-Releases/2024/04/01/21/51/study-links-e-cigarette-use-with-higher-risk-of-heart-failure#:~:text=Breaking%20the%20data%20down%20by,fill%20with%20blood%20between%20contractions.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;according to the report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Let&apos;s be honest here. It&apos;s great news because sometimes we need to point to these studies to really hone this in on people,&quot; said Dr. Nicole Saphier, speaking to &quot;Fox &amp;amp; Friends Weekend&quot; on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/smoking-shrinks-brain-drives-alzheimers-risk-study-finds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SMOKING SHRINKS THE BRAIN AND DRIVES UP ALZHEIMER&apos;S RISK, NEW STUDY FINDS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On one hand, it [vaping] is a little bit better [than traditional cigarettes]. However, let&apos;s think about what vaping is. It still has the nicotine. We know nicotine has direct effects on our blood vessels. When you decrease the elasticity of your blood vessels, that puts more stress on your heart. So it&apos;s not surprising that if you are still consuming nicotine, it will affect your heart. But on top of that, you&apos;re also vaping new chemicals. You&apos;re creating chemicals that are now going into your lung,&quot; Dr. Saphier explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/first-new-quit-smoking-drug-20-years-shows-promising-results-us-trial-hope-excitement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FIRST NEW ‘QUIT-SMOKING’ DRUG IN 20 YEARS SHOWS PROMISING RESULTS IN US TRIAL: ‘HOPE AND EXCITEMENT’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally thought to be a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes, Dr. Saphier said e-cigarettes are also linked to a phenomenon called &quot;popcorn lung,&quot; a disease resulting from damage to air sacs in the lungs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I certainly don&apos;t recommend it for everyone. Maybe it&apos;s a good stepping stone to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/e-cigarette-users-may-be-less-likely-to-quit-smoking-says-a-new-study&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;get off traditional cigarettes&lt;/a&gt;, but for long-term, absolutely not. It is detrimental,&quot; she continued.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/be-well-quit-smoking-encourage-someone-else-kick-habit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BE WELL: QUIT SMOKING (OR ENCOURAGE SOMEONE ELSE TO KICK THE HABIT)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketing campaigns for vaping have appealed to younger audiences in recent years, touting flavors like cotton candy, marshmallow and bubble gum to entice potential buyers, similar to decades-long advertisements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the years, though, advertisements for traditional cigarettes have dwindled as experts have increasingly sounded the alarm over their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/924897996001&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;potential side effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Saphier says the advertising industry should follow suit on e-cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of marketing efforts campaigned for it… It&apos;s like they want our youth to be damaged,&quot; she said. &quot;We&apos;re really trying to restrict some of the advertising. I mean, at the end of the day, people have to know the truth about the dangers of vaping.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Blowing &apos;smoke&apos;: Mount Etna puts on a show by emitting rare rings into the sky</title>
                    
                    <description>Europe&amp;apos;s largest active volcano, Mount Etna in Italy, has been emitting &amp;quot;smoke rings&amp;quot; since last week, putting on a spectacular show for tourists and locals alike.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tourists in Italy have been treated to quite the show as Mount Etna, the largest active &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;volcano in Europe,&lt;/a&gt; has been blowing spectacular &quot;smoke rings&quot; into the sky since last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rare phenomenon, known as &quot;volcanic vortex rings,&quot; is generated by the combination of rapid gas release and the vent shape spewed out of a new crater that opened on Tuesday on Etna&apos;s summit, according to The Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pictures and video show the volcano looking like a chimney blowing out a stream of rings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Etna is breaking all previous records,&quot; Boris Behncke, volcanologist at the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Catania Boris, explained in a Facebook post. &quot;In the late afternoon of 2 April 2024, a small mouth opened on the north-eastern rim of the South-East Crater, producing puffs of glowing gas. By the next morning it was evident that these puffs were producing an impressive amount of steam rings, and this activity has been going on ever since, having already emitted hundreds if not thousands of these pretty rings.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/italys-mount-etna-volcano-spews-lava-in-new-active-phase&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ITALY&apos;S MOUNT ETNA VOLCANO SPEWS LAVA IN NEW ACTIVE PHASE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behncke said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/planet-earth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;no volcano on Earth&lt;/a&gt; produces as many vapor rings as Etna. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even if a volcano has the capability to create smoke rings, strong winds will prevent them from forming,&quot; the Daily Mail reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/mount-etna-eruption-triggers-earthquake-in-sicily-injuring-10-people&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOUNT ETNA ERUPTION TRIGGERS EARTHQUAKE IN SICILY, INJURING AT LEAST 10 PEOPLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Etna frequently erupts, most recently in November 2023 when the volcano sent a lava fountain into the air, causing loud booms and explosions, according to FOX Weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Located in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/italy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;coastal city of Catania,&lt;/a&gt; Etna is the largest of Italy&apos;s three active volcanoes and the largest active volcano in Europe, according to the European Space Agency,&quot; the outlet states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no reports of particular disruptions in the surrounding villages or at Catania airport as a result of the &quot;smoke rings.&quot; The airport often closes in the case of major eruptions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>WNBA legend&apos;s warning for Caitlin Clark before turning pro: &apos;Reality is coming&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Former UConn star Diana Taurasi offered a blunt take on Iowa&amp;apos;s sharpshooter Caitlin Clark as she gets ready to transition to the pros over the weekend.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the result on Sunday, Iowa star Caitlin Clark will turn pro and head to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/wnba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the WNBA&lt;/a&gt; to embark on a new journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Diana Taurasi – a legend in both women’s college basketball &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/connecticut-huskies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;at UConn&lt;/a&gt; and the WNBA with the Phoenix Mercury – had a stark warning for Clark as she gets ready for the professional ranks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Reality is coming,&quot; she said on ESPN after the Hawkeyes’ win over the Huskies. &quot;You look superhuman playing against some 18-year-olds but you&apos;re going to come play with some grown women that have been playing professional basketball for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is gonna be a transition period where you&apos;re going to have to give yourself some grace as a rookie.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lsu-star-angel-reese-declares-wnba-draft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LSU STAR ANGEL REESE DECLARES FOR WNBA DRAFT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark will leave Iowa as the all-time scorer in NCAA basketball history. After Friday’s win, Clark is averaging 31.7 points and nine assists per game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s expected to be the No. 1 pick &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/caitlin-clark-ready-wnba-chapter-historic-college-career-this-is-what-i-dreamed-of&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;of the WNBA Draft&lt;/a&gt;. The Indiana Fever hold the top draft pick for the second consecutive season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Fever selected Aliyah Boston as the top pick out of South Carolina. She was an All-Star in her first season and won the WNBA Rookie of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indiana finished 13-27. The team hasn’t made the playoffs since 2016 and won its only championship in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Ecuador police arrest former VP in raid at Mexican embassy, prompting diplomatic severing, outcry</title>
                    
                    <description>Ecuador police raided Mexico&amp;apos;s embassy in Quito and arrested former Ecuadorian Vice President Jorge Glas who had been living there since December.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Friday evening announced the severing of diplomatic relations with Ecuador following the arrest of former Ecuadorian Vice President Jorge Glas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecuadorian police late Friday broke through the external doors of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/location-mexico&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mexican embassy&lt;/a&gt; in the Ecuadorian capital, Quito, to arrest Glas, who had been residing there since December. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glas sought political asylum at the embassy after being indicted on corruption charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is not possible. It cannot be. This is crazy,&quot; Roberto Canseco, head of the Mexican consular section in Quito, told local press while standing outside the embassy right after the raid, according to The Associated Press. &quot;I am very worried because they could kill him. There is no basis to do this. This is totally outside the norm.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/police-find-7-bodies-5-decapitated-1-dismembered-mexicos-fifth-largest-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POLICE FIND 7 BODIES, 5 OF THEM DECAPITATED AND 1 DISMEMBERED, IN MEXICO&apos;S FIFTH LARGEST CITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alicia Bárcena, Mexico’s secretary of foreign relations, on Friday posted on the social media platform X that a number of diplomats suffered injuries during the break-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bárcena said Mexico would take the case to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/top-un-court-issues-preliminary-ruling-south-africas-genocide-case-against-israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;International Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; in The Hague, Netherlands, &quot;to denounce Ecuador’s responsibility for violations of international law.&quot; She also recalled Mexican diplomats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecuador&apos;s Foreign Minister Gabriela Sommerfeld on Saturday told reporters that the decision to enter the embassy was made by President Daniel Noboa after considering Glas&apos; &quot;imminent flight risk&quot; and exhausting all possibilities for diplomatic dialogue with Mexico. Mexico granted Glas asylum hours before the raid. Sommerfeld said that &quot;it is not legal to grant asylum to people convicted of common crimes and by competent courts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities are investigating Glas over alleged irregularities during his management of reconstruction efforts following a powerful earthquake in 2016 that killed hundreds of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was convicted of bribery and corruption charges in other cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Organization of American States reminded its members, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/latin-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;include Ecuador and Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, of their obligation not to &quot;invoke norms of domestic law to justify non-compliance with their international obligations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spanish foreign ministry, in a statement Sunday, said, &quot;The entry by force into the Embassy of Mexico in Quito constitutes a violation of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. We call for respect for international law and harmony between Mexico and Ecuador, brotherly countries to Spain and members of the Ibero-American community.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, &quot;The United States condemns any violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, and takes very seriously the obligation of host countries under international law to respect the inviolability of diplomatic missions.&quot; He called on both countries to resolve their differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/dozens-charged-international-drug-smuggling-operation-linked-brutal-mexican-cartel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOZENS CHARGED IN INTERNATIONAL DRUG SMUGGLING OPERATION LINKED TO BRUTAL MEXICAN CARTEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honduran President Xiomara Castro, writing on X, characterized the raid as &quot;an intolerable act for the international community&quot; and a &quot;violation of the sovereignty of the Mexican State and international law&quot; because &quot;it ignores the historical and fundamental right to asylum.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Glas was taken from the attorney general’s office in Quito to the port city of Guayaquil, where he will remain in custody at a maximum-security prison. People who had gathered outside the prosecutor’s office yelled &quot;strength&quot; as he left with a convoy of police and military vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glas&apos; attorney, Sonia Vera, told the AP that officers broke into his room and he resisted when they attempted to put his hands behind his back. She said the officers then &quot;knocked him to the floor, kicked him in the head, in the spine, in the legs, the hands,&quot; and when he &quot;couldn’t walk, they dragged him out.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vera said the defense team was not allowed to speak with Glas while he was at the prosecutor&apos;s office, and it is now working to file a habeas corpus petition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Diplomatic premises&lt;/a&gt; are considered foreign soil and &quot;inviolable&quot; under the Vienna treaties and host country law enforcement agencies are not allowed to enter without the permission of the ambassador. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People seeking asylum have lived anywhere from days to years at embassies around the world, including at Ecuador&apos;s in London, which housed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/julian-assange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange&lt;/a&gt; for seven years because British police could not enter to arrest him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Ex-WNBA player Val Whiting makes clear stance on transgender athletes in women&apos;s sports</title>
                    
                    <description>Former WNBA player Val Whiting offered her take on transgender participation in women&amp;apos;s sports after Dawn Staley was asked about the issue on Saturday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Val Whiting, a former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/wnba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WNBA player&lt;/a&gt; who was a two-time national champion at Stanford, made her stance on transgender participation in women’s sports clear on Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whiting gave her take on X after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/south-carolina-gamecocks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;South Carolina Gamecocks&lt;/a&gt; head coach Dawn Staley was asked about the issue earlier in the day as the team prepared for their national championship game against the Iowa Hawkeyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of my basketball sisters feel differently but trans women do not belong in women’s sports,&quot; Whiting wrote. &quot;It’s not fair nor safe for biological women. There has to be another solution for trans women to be able to compete athletically besides having them compete against biological women.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whiting played in the American Basketball League and Women’s National Basketball League before the WNBA took off. She then played for the Detroit Shock and the Minnesota Lynx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She played around the same time as Staley. The Basketball Hall of Famer played for the Charlotte Sting. Staley played more than seven seasons with the Sting before a short stint with the Houston Comets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/iowas-close-win-uconn-womens-final-four-draws-record-ratings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IOWA&apos;S CLOSE WIN OVER UCONN IN WOMEN&apos;S FINAL FOUR DRAWS RECORD RATINGS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a press conference, OutKick’s Dan Zaksheske &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outkick.com/sports/dawn-staley-trangender-women-sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;asked Staley her thoughts&lt;/a&gt; on the burning issue in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m of the opinion of, if you&apos;re a woman, you should play. If you consider yourself a woman, and you want to play sports or vice versa, you should be able to play. That&apos;s my opinion. You want me to go deeper?&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked whether she thought &quot;transgender women should be able to participate in women&apos;s college basketball,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/south-carolinas-dawn-staley-draws-strong-reactions-remarks-trans-participation-womens-sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Staley responded&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Yes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&apos;s the question you want to ask, I&apos;ll give you that. Yes, yes. So, now the barnstormer people are going to flood my timeline and be a distraction to me on one of the biggest days of our game, and I&apos;m OK with that. I really am,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Sen. John Fetterman unloads on squatters, says they have &apos;no rights&apos;: &apos;I am not woke&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Sen. John Fetterman sounded off on squatters during a recent interview, saying they had &amp;quot;no rights&amp;quot; as homeowners deal with squatting across the U.S.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., sounded off &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nyc-migrant-squatters-drugs-guns-previously-caught-southern-border-released-ice&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;on squatters&lt;/a&gt; during a recent interview, questioning how they had a right to occupy another person&apos;s home as squatting continues to take a toll on homeowners across the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an interview with the New York Post, published on Saturday, Fetterman said squatters have &quot;no rights.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Squatters have no rights,&quot; Fetterman said. &quot;How can you even pretend that this is anything other than you’re just breaking the law?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fetterman also told &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2024/04/06/us-news/fetterman-blasts-squatters-violent-crime-i-am-not-woke/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Post&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;I am not woke.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s wild, that if you go away on a long trip, for 30 days, and someone breaks into your home and suddenly they have rights,&quot; he said. &quot;This is crazy. Like if somebody stole your car, and then they held it for 30 days, then somehow you now have some rights?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/squatting-trend-tipping-point-migrants-coach-others-how-exploit-laws-experts-warn-damage-is-done&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SQUATTING TREND AT TIPPING POINT AS MIGRANTS COACH OTHERS HOW TO EXPLOIT LAWS; EXPERT WARNS &apos;DAMAGE IS DONE&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fetterman also called for a smarter, more aggressive crime policy, and spoke out against the man who allegedly shot NYPD Officer Jonathan Diller. The alleged murderer had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/suspects-shooting-death-nypd-officer-jonathan-diller-identified-lengthy-records&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;several prior arrests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you have those kinds of established records, it doesn’t serve any greater goal to allow people that are offending, offending, offending and allow them to not be held accountable,&quot; Fetterman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania senator has also remained a strong supporter of Israel, despite the pushback from his own party. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-bill-aims-to-close-squatting-loophole-after-homeowner-terrorized-for-34-days-40000-in-damages&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FLORIDA BILL AIMS TO CLOSE SQUATTING LOOPHOLE AFTER HOMEOWNER TERRORIZED FOR 34 DAYS, $40,000 IN DAMAGES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s reasonable if you want to criticize, but to call for effectively… like a regime change, I disagree,&quot; Fetterman told the Post, in reference to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and his comments on the Israeli government. &quot;I didn’t agree because Israel is a democracy, it is our key special ally. And our nation wouldn’t appreciate any kind of foreign input. So why should we do that for Israel?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schumer called on Israel to elect a new prime minister so that they could move forward with a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt; previously reported. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The majority leader said he believed that &quot;Prime Minister Netanyahu has lost his way by allowing his political survival to take the precedence over the best interests of Israel.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fetterman, who is a strong supporter of President Biden, warned the election between him and Donald Trump would be very close in his home state – but predicted the president would still end up winning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s going to be very close. Trump is going to be incredibly strong in Pennsylvania,&quot; Fetterman said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Israel withdraws all ground troops from southern Gaza, leaving just one IDF brigade in the enclave</title>
                    
                    <description>Israel announced a major troops withdrawal from southern Gaza on Sunday even as PM Netanyahu promised the war would continue until Hamas is eradicated.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Israel Defense Forces announced a full withdrawal of ground forces from southern Gaza on Sunday, leaving a smaller force to maintain operations in the whole of the strip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also delivered remarks at the beginning of a cabinet meeting on Sunday, reiterating that Israel would not agree to any cease-fire unless Hamas frees all remaining hostages. The bulk of the troops withdrawing in the coming days will be leaving Khan Younis, which had served as Hamas&apos; central bastion in the south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today, Sunday April 7th, the IDF’s 98th commando division has concluded its mission in Khan Yunis. The division left the Gaza strip in order to recuperate and prepare for future operations,&quot; the IDF said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A significant force led by the 162nd division and the Nahal brigade continues to operate in the Gaza strip, and will preserve the IDF’s freedom of action and its ability to conduct precise intelligence-based operations,&quot; the statement continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-moore-accuses-biden-being-arms-dealer-israels-ethnic-cleansing-palestinians&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL MOORE ACCUSES BIDEN OF BEING ‘ARMS DEALER’ FOR ISRAEL&apos;S ‘ETHNIC CLEANSING’ OF PALESTINIANS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu promised his cabinet that the war in Gaza would continue, however, arguing that &quot;there is no war more just than this one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/share-americans-say-jews-us-face-lot-discrimination-spikes-2021-poll&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SHARE OF AMERICANS WHO SAY JEWS IN US FACE ‘A LOT’ OF DISCRIMINATION SPIKES SINCE 2021: POLL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have made it clear to the international community: There will be no ceasefire without the return of the hostages. It simply will not happen. This is the policy of the Government of Israel and I welcome the fact that the Biden administration made it clear on Friday that this is still its position as well,&quot; Netanyahu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I would like to clarify something else: It is not Israel that is preventing a deal. Hamas is preventing a deal. Its extreme demands are designed to bring about a ceasefire and leave it intact, to ensure its survival, existence and ability to endanger our citizens and soldiers. Capitulation to Hamas&apos;s demands would allow it to try and repeat the crimes of October 7 again and again, as it has promised to do,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel&apos;s retaliatory war against Hamas &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-defense-minister-says-hamas-has-ceased-function-military-organization&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;entered its sixth month&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, and there remains no end in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said last week that Hamas has &quot;ceased to function as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;military organization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in most parts of the Gaza Strip,&quot; but there remains work to be done elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IDF has been pressing for weeks to invade Rafah, a town bordering Egypt that plays host to roughly 1 million displaced Palestinians and, Israel says, the last vestiges of Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden and Netanyahu remain starkly opposed on plans to invade the region, however, with the U.S. fearing it could come at a vast cost in civilian lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ghost of the Polo Grounds still haunts old-time &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;baseball fans&lt;/a&gt; today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sprawling New York City sports arena occupied a nook of Manhattan along the Harlem River called Coogan’s Hollow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It still occupies a giant part of baseball lore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/new-york-city-wiener-war-recalls-glory-days-big-apple-battles-ruled-baseball&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK CITY WIENER WAR RECALLS GLORY DAYS WHEN BIG APPLE BATTLES RULED BASEBALL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The footprint of the Polo Grounds, now a housing project, has become &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/travel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a pilgrimage site&lt;/a&gt; for baseball fans searching for the glory days of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Baseball began in New York City and it gave the sport a populist place to start and to grow and to spread around the rest of the country,&quot; baseball historian Eric Miklich of New York told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Polo Grounds was absolutely central to the sport&apos;s growth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Giants called the vast arena home from 1891 until they left for San Francisco after the 1957 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/little-miss-bbq-is-boss-phoenix-hotspot-serves-world-class-cue-southwestern-style&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LITTLE MISS BBQ IS THE BOSS: PHOENIX HOTSPOT SERVES WORLD-CLASS &apos;CUE WITH SOUTHWESTERN STYLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Giants won the pennant! The Giants won the pennant!&quot; — one of the most memorable calls in sports history — with Bobby Thomson&apos;s home run at the Polo Grounds in 1951. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilie Mays made his miraculous over-the-shoulder catch near the &quot;483 feet&quot; marker of centerfield at the Polo Grounds in the 1954 World Series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Babe Ruth put on pinstripes for the first time in 1920, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/new-york-yankees&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; played their home games at the Polo Grounds, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spurred by sudden success, they moved into their own arena across the river in the Bronx in 1923. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yankee Stadium was dubbed &quot;the House that Ruth Built.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; was the center of the baseball world for the next three decades: the Giants in Manhattan, the Yankees in the Bronx and the Dodgers in Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This was the golden age of New York baseball,&quot; Luke Spencer wrote for Atlas Obscura on a tour of the site of the former Polo Grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Mets also played at the Polo Grounds. So, too, did the New York Cubans and New York Black Yankees of the Negro Leagues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NFL&apos;s Giants and Jets also called the Polo Grounds home at one point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/meet-american-who-true-father-baseball-new-york-city-physician-daniel-doc-adams&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEET THE AMERICAN WHO IS THE ‘TRUE FATHER OF BASEBALL,’ NEW YORK CITY PHYSICIAN DANIEL ‘DOC’ ADAMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dodgers headed west with the Giants in 1957. New York City lost its status as center of the baseball world. The Polo Grounds hosted its last sports event in 1963. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York City knocked down the baseball temple in 1964. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Workmen clad in Giants jerseys tipping their hardhats as a wrecking ball — painted like a baseball — slammed into the famed stadium,&quot; Sports Illustrated reported last year of the sad moment in sports history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A public housing project, Polo Grounds Towers, rose over the footprint of the arena and opened in 1968. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site is easily accessible by taking the B or D trains of the NYC subway to 155th Street Station. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A plaque mounted on the side of one of the housing project high-rises marks the location of home plate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of the Polo Grounds is still felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two residents quickly pointed a Fox News Digital reporter to the site of the home plate plaque, as if asked countless times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;John T. Brush Stairway Presented by the New York Giants,&quot; reads the inscription on a staircase up the bluff of Coogan&apos;s Hollow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stairwell was dedicated in 1913 to the team owner who died the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fans may no longer throng down the old staircase making their way to watch their beloved New York Giants play,&quot; Spencer wrote on Atlas Obscura. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But it is all that remains from the sad day they tore down the old Polo Grounds.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Expert calls into question Pentagon’s abortion travel policy, calls it a ‘repudiation’ of ‘woke ideology’</title>
                    
                    <description>The DOD reported that a new policy that provided for taxpayer funding of abortion travel for service members was used only 12 times between June and December 2023.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pentagon-releases-data-controversial-abortion-travel-policy-service-members&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Pentagon reported last month&lt;/a&gt; that the Biden administration&apos;s push to cover travel expenses for service members seeking an abortion was utilized only 12 times in six months, which one expert said is a sign of the military rejecting the policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pentagon-will-pay-service-members-travel-obtain-abortions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced&lt;/a&gt; in Oct. 2022, the Pentagon would pay for service members and their dependents who opted to travel to obtain abortions using taxpayer dollars &quot;when timely access to those services is not available near a member&apos;s permanent duty station.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connor Semelsberger, the government relations manager for The Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital that since the 1980s, before Roe v. Wade was overturned, the DOD has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.health.mil/Reference-Center/Frequently-Asked-Questions/Reproductive-Health-QA-Covered-Abortions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;followed a federal law&lt;/a&gt; that says that the government agency cannot pay for or perform elective abortions. They could, however, perform abortions in instances of rape, incest or the life of the mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But then, Roe falls in 2022, the Biden administration basically has this whole government approach [of] &apos;we&apos;re going to pay for, promote and push abortion in any way we can&apos; … where they basically argued that although the law states they can&apos;t perform the abortions, they would pay for them,&quot; Semelsberger explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tubervilles-office-hits-back-pentagon-subsidizing-troops-abortions-too-cute-by-half&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TUBERVILLE&apos;S OFFICE HITS BACK AFTER PENTAGON SAYS IT&apos;S NOT SUBSIDIZING TROOPS&apos; ABORTIONS: ‘TOO CUTE BY HALF’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defense Department officials said they didn’t begin tracking travel under the year-old policy until August and weren’t able to gather any data from March through July. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also unclear what the 12 trips were actually for, since the policy can also be used for other fertility-related health services other than abortion. Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh noted that while the policy was used 12 times, it does not mean the policy was used by 12 individuals and could have been used by one individual more than once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They don&apos;t even know with certainty that it was even used for abortion, because this extended leave policy and flight policy applies to other reproductive procedures like IVF or other fertility treatments you may go out of state to get,&quot; Semelsberger said. &quot;IVF could take 2 or 3 different trips, so this could be only a handful of people, not even 12 different people using this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&apos;s been made clear over decades and generations of polling that Americans don&apos;t want their funds paying for abortion or abortion travel or anything related to abortion,&quot; Semelsberger said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think this is just another repudiation of this kind of woke ideology that&apos;s percolating throughout all the government, but in a particular way, in the military, and those that have over the years really felt patriotic, wanting to fight for the country, do service for the country, really saying, &apos;No, abortion isn&apos;t for me,&apos;&quot; he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-thune-challenges-administration-abortion-policy-demands-protection-military-leaders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEN THUNE CHALLENGES BIDEN ADMIN&apos;S PENTAGON ABORTION POLICY, DEMANDS PROTECTION FOR MILITARY LEADERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 12 reported instances in which service members or dependents were granted additional paid leave to travel out of state for &quot;reproductive health services&quot; cost taxpayers around $44,000 - $45,000, according to the DOD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you take that $44,000, you average it out across the 12 trips, that comes to about $3,700 per time,&quot; Semelsberger said. &quot;That&apos;s a lot of money, right? So again, that&apos;s not even the abortion, that&apos;s covering the flights and all this stuff. So really, the financial benefit to the service members and their dependents that choose this is really high, $3,700 to go fly to wherever, get a hotel and get food for a night or two nights to get maybe a late-term abortion, which can take up to 2 or 3 days, depending on how far along the woman might be, that&apos;s really generous.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous statement to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-biden-admin-abortion-travel-policy-military-readiness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digitial&lt;/a&gt;, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss stated, &quot;This administration has recklessly politicized the military with this farce of a policy.&quot; He added, &quot;The Department even admitted today that those that use the policy may not have even used it for an abortion. The reality is that access to abortions is not a threat to readiness.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/elise-stefanik-promises-reckoning-biden-woke-pentagon-indoctrinating-military-connected-children&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;REP. STEFANIK PROMISES A RECKONING AGAINST BIDEN&apos;S WOKE PENTAGON FOR INDOCTRINATING MILITARY CHILDREN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austin argued at the time the rule was enacted that, with some states banning abortion after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the &quot;readiness&quot; of service members and their families in those states would be impacted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In my judgment, such effects qualify as unusual, extraordinary, hardship, or emergency circumstances for service members and their dependents and will interfere with our ability to recruit, retain, and maintain the readiness of a highly qualified force,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These policies ensure that service members and their families are afforded the time and flexibility to make private health care decisions, as well as supporting access to noncovered reproductive health care regardless of where they are stationed,&quot; Singh also said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, despite the fact that the DOD is &quot;dangling this financial carrot&quot; for women, the data shows they are often choosing not to have an abortion, Semelsberger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even though the administration has pushed the thumb on the scale towards abortion saying, &apos;To be militarily ready so you can get back right out there and fight on the front lines, we need you not to be pregnant, we need you to get that abortion, we&apos;ll even give you $3,500 to get it, we don&apos;t want you to be pregnant,&apos;&quot; he said. &quot;Basically, the service members are telling the government that, &apos;No, we actually don&apos;t want that.&apos;&quot;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOD, Semelsberger explained, spent months going back and forth with the U.S. Senate, particularly Republican senators asking why such a move was necessary. &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So here they are, pushing this, promoting this as this thing that every service member needs access to, no matter where you live and what military base you&apos;re on, you need to have immediate access to abortion and basically the troops are saying that this isn&apos;t really something we really need or want to use,&quot; he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Biden admin was willing to stake their whole claim on this, that it&apos;s legal and it&apos;s necessary for the troops and military readiness, and yet, they can&apos;t even say 12 people took advantage of it,&quot; he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semelsberger said the low numbers are a testament to the sentiment that Americans, and service members more specifically, don&apos;t want taxpayer funding used for abortions and would much rather see their military pay for service members to have families and paid time off to take care of their children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To be family friendly, which the military has over the years been, both in terms of how much they promote marriage and the benefits of service members that are married, this just kind of starts to unwind that by pushing abortion,&quot; he said. &quot;I think the culture is sending a shockwave and maybe that will happen at the ballot box this year, in terms of how they feel about these policies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Student protesters reportedly condemned Hillary Clinton as a &amp;quot;war criminal&amp;quot; during her appearance at her alma mater, Wellesley College, on Saturday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton faced student protests during a visit to her alma mater, Wellesley College, on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton had returned to campus in order to receive the honor of a college building being named after her. Protesters were lined up to harass attendees of a women-led democracy summit on campus that also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/watch-hillary-clinton-speech-repeatedly-interrupted-pro-palestinian-protesters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;featured Clinton.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local news outlets say angry students also circulated pamphlets around campus saying Clinton is Wellesley&apos;s &quot;most beloved war criminal,&quot; and arguing that she has &quot;blood on her hands.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School administrators acknowledged the protest but did not condemn it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-interrupted-protesters-second-time-two-days-receives-uaw-endorsement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN INTERRUPTED BY PROTESTERS FOR SECOND TIME IN TWO DAYS AS HE RECEIVES UAW ENDORSEMENT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I encourage all who participate in activism to follow the demonstration policy and be mindful of our Code of Student Conduct so that you remain safe for yourself, and for our community,&quot; vice president and dean of students Sheilah Shaw Horton said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6346572514112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Clinton is no stranger&lt;/a&gt; to facing protests during her visits to American universities. Protesters repeatedly interrupted her during an appearance at Columbia University in February, with students calling her a &quot;war criminal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pro-palestinian-group-may-have-raised-money-hamas-broke-donation-laws-state-ag&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PRO-PALESTINIAN GROUP MAY HAVE RAISED MONEY FOR HAMAS, BROKE DONATION LAWS, STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday&apos;s protest comes just days after Clinton chided U.S. voters during an appearance on the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; with Jimmy Fallon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fallon asked Clinton what she&apos;d say to voters who are &quot;upset&quot; that former President Trump and President Biden are the only two choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Get over yourself. Those are the two choices,&quot; Clinton responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yeah! I love that,&quot; Fallon reacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;One is old, and effective, and compassionate, has a heart and really cares about people. And one is old and has been charged with 91 felonies,&quot; Clinton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-panics-trumps-gain-young-voters-biden-might-lose-because-hot-dogs-cost-more&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BILL MAHER PANICS OVER TRUMP&apos;S GAIN WITH YOUNG VOTERS: BIDEN MIGHT LOSE ‘BECAUSE HOT DOGS COST MORE’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t understand why this is even a hard choice, really. I don&apos;t understand it,&quot; Clinton continued. &quot;But we have to go through the election and hopefully people will realize what&apos;s at stake because it&apos;s an existential question. What kind of country we&apos;re gonna have, what kind of democracy we can have and people who blow that off are not paying attention because it&apos;s not like Trump, his enablers, his empowerers, his allies are not telling us what they want to do. I mean, they&apos;re pretty clear about what kind of country they want.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Rebecca Lavrenz, a Colorado woman known as the Jan. 6 &amp;quot;praying grandma,&amp;quot; could face up to a year in prison after spending 10 minutes inside the Capitol.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Colorado woman known on social media as the &quot;J6 Praying Grandma&quot; was convicted of four federal misdemeanor counts last week in connection to the Jan. 6 riot &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/capitol-protests&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;at the U.S. Capitol&lt;/a&gt; and could face up to a year in prison. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Lavrenz, a 71-year-old great-grandmother who reportedly operates a bed and breakfast outside of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/colorado&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Colorado Springs&lt;/a&gt;, was convicted by a 12-member jury in Washington, D.C., on Thursday of entering and remaining in a restricted building, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol, The Gazette reported. Sentencing is scheduled for Aug. 12, and Lavrenz reportedly could face up to a year in prison and fines of more than $200,000, excluding legal fees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman told the Gazette that though she was &quot;surprised&quot; about the verdict, &quot;I believe God wanted it to turn out this way so my voice could be amplified. We have to wake up our country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The whole reason I went to the Capitol was to pray,&quot; Lavrenz told the newspaper. &quot;I didn’t get into this for myself, I was there to stand up for my country. God led me to go there and into the building to stand up for my First Amendment rights to petition the government for a redress of grievances.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rfk-disavows-campaign-email-calling-jan-6-protesters-activists-stripped-constitutional-liberties&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RFK DISAVOWS CAMPAIGN EMAIL CALLING JAN. 6 PROTESTERS &apos;ACTIVISTS&apos; STRIPPED OF &apos;CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTIES&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former President Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, wrote on TRUTH Social in the wake of the conviction that Lavrenz &quot;has been unfairly targeted by Crooked Joe Biden’s DOJ, and now faces up to 1 YEAR in prison for peacefully walking around the Capitol, and praying for our Failing Nation on January 6th!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing a link to where people can donate to support Lavrenz’s legal expenses, Trump said the grandmother and &quot;small business owner&quot; is now &quot;one of Joe Biden’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-free-jan-6-rioters-first-day-re-elected&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;J6 HOSTAGES&lt;/a&gt;!!!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-mexico-county-commissioner-who-participated-in-jan-6-riot-loses-supreme-court-appeal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW MEXICO COUNTY COMMISSIONER WHO PARTICIPATED IN JAN 6 RIOT LOSES SUPREME COURT APPEAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Crooked Joe Biden spends more time prosecuting Patriots like Rebecca, AND ME, than Violent Criminals, Thugs, Murderers, and ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS who are destroying our Country. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST. MAGA2024!&quot; Trump concluded on TRUTH Social on Friday.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the White House and Justice Department for comment on Trump&apos;s posted remarks, but they did not immediately respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/justice-department&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; accused Lavrenz of spending just 10 minutes inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Court documents say the FBI conducted a &quot;consensual interview&quot; with Lavrenz at her home on April 6, 2021, when she allegedly admitted to agents that she had been in Washington, D.C., to participate in the &quot;Stop the Steal&quot; rally on the mall and followed the crowd to the U.S. Capitol building. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lavrenz observed people getting into &quot;physical confrontations&quot; with police as the crowd grew, but &quot;when a man finally succeeded in pushing past a barrier and entering the U.S. Capitol, Lavrenz observed that none of the police officers chased him,&quot; according to the DOJ court filing. She followed the crowd streaming past the barriers and into the Capitol&apos;s main door on the east side. As she stated, and as video footage supports, she spent about 10 minutes inside, roaming from the East center entrance to the Rotunda and back, speaking briefly with a U.S. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Capitol Police officer&lt;/a&gt;, and exiting through the same door she entered. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;President Biden may fail to get on Ohio&apos;s general election ballot after the state&apos;s top election official warned his campaign about missing a key deadline on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, notified top Democratic officials that their party&apos;s national convention is scheduled to occur well past the deadline for certifying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a presidential candidate&lt;/a&gt; in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to convene on August 19, 2024, which occurs more than a week after the August 7 deadline to certify a presidential candidate to the office,&quot; LaRose wrote to Ohio Democratic Party Chairwoman Liz Walters, according to the letter first obtained by ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am left to conclude that the Democratic National Committee must either move up its nominating convention or the Ohio General Assembly must act by May 9, 2024 (90 days prior to a new law&apos;s effective date) to create an exception to this statutory requirement,&quot; LaRose legal counsel, Paul Disantis, wrote in the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-ripped-admitting-quiet-part-out-loud-panic-key-strategy-helping-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DEMS BLASTED OVER LEAKED MEMO THAT SAYS &apos;QUIET PART OUT LOUD&apos; ABOUT VOTER REGISTRATION EFFORTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/democratic-strategist-boasts-party-fought-undermine-dangerous-third-party-threat-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST BOASTS PARTY FOUGHT TO UNDERMINE &apos;DANGEROUS&apos; THIRD-PARTY THREAT TO BIDEN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden&apos;s campaign&lt;/a&gt; did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital on Sunday, but told ABC News that they were &quot;monitoring the situation in Ohio&quot; and remain &quot;confident that Joe Biden will be on the ballot in all 50 states.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ohio Democratic Party has yet to respond publicly to LaRose&apos;s letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of the letter came the same day an internal memo showing panic within the Democratic Party over its &quot;nonpartisan&quot; voter registration efforts potentially helping &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-ripped-admitting-quiet-part-out-loud-panic-key-strategy-helping-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;former President Trump.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrat-campaign-call-reveals-panic-mode-rfk-jr-white-house-bid-scramble-save-biden-relection-hopes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DEM CAMPAIGN CALL REVEALS PANIC MODE OVER RFK JR.&apos;S WHITE HOUSE BID, SCRAMBLE TO SAVE BIDEN RE-ELECTION HOPES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats across the country have become increasingly concerned over the amount of support Trump is pulling from usually reliable demographics and donors have been bickering over an internal memo casting doubt on whether the party should continue using nonprofits to register unregistered voters over fears it could help Trump, the Washington Post reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Indeed, if we were to blindly register nonvoters and get them on the rolls, we would be distinctly aiding Trump’s quest for a personal dictatorship,&quot; the memo explained, casting doubt on the longstanding Democrat voter registration push that typically has resulted in favorable results in previous elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memo argues that Democrats should focus their registration efforts only in &quot;specific, heavily pro-Biden populations&quot; and the Washington Post explained that &quot;the rise in Trump support among nonregistered voters has run up against a long-held Democratic policy priority of growing the voter rolls.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Andrew Mark Miller contributed to this report&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>WWIII could start over Philippines dispute in South China Sea, China &apos;not respecting&apos; treaties, expert says</title>
                    
                    <description>China has increased provocations against the Philippines over territorial claims in the South China Sea. A recent opinion piece in the government-run China Daily warned Manila &amp;apos;against the horrors of war.&amp;apos;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Beijing warned that World War III could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-warned-as-philippine-president-proposes-countermeasures-against-beijings-aggression&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;break out in the South China Sea&lt;/a&gt; as it increasingly shifts its attention to the Philippines, with territorial disputes driving tensions ever higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Although we have a mutual defense treaty with the Philippines, China is not respecting it,&quot; Gordon Chang, a China expert and fellow at the Gatestone Institute, told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was twice last month, on the 5th and the 29th, that the State Department issued written warnings to China that we were prepared to use force to discharge our obligations pursuant to article four of the U.S. Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty,&quot; Chang explained. &quot;That&apos;s a warning that we are prepared to go to war.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First reported by MEMRI&apos;s China Media Studies Project, the state-owned and -operated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rubio-calls-us-media-outlets-cut-ties-ccp-propaganda-outlet-china-daily&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;news outlet China Daily&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week published an op-ed titled &quot;Manila must be warned against horrors of war&quot; by Yang Xiao, deputy director of the Institute of Maritime Strategy Studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-sends-warplanes-boats-taiwan-phone-call-xi-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINA SENDS WARPLANES, BOATS AROUND TAIWAN FOLLOWING PHONE CALL BETWEEN XI AND BIDEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang, a frequently featured expert in a range of China Daily articles, drew connections between the current tensions between China and the Philippines and tensions in Pre-World War I Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article notes at the bottom that &quot;the views don’t necessarily reflect those of China Daily,&quot; but Yang engages in an inflammatory discussion of history and current tensions, referring to the &quot;Sarajevo gunshot&quot; after warning against Philippine politicians&apos; &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-not-help-philippines-build-new-port-taiwan-governor-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;flirtation with the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; in the hope of gaining the upper hand in the maritime dispute with China.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The lessons of World War I should be heeded, especially by small states, because triggering a conflict will serve no country’s interest,&quot; Yang wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in the piece, Yang wrote that American &quot;decision-makers&quot; should realize that &quot;the U.S.’s military intervention on behalf of the Philippines would also be disastrous for neighboring countries. The South China Sea has been a sea of peace and cooperation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/indonesian-president-elect-meets-japans-prime-minister-commits-strengthening-relations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INDONESIAN PRESIDENT-ELECT MEETS WITH JAPAN&apos;S PRIME MINISTER, COMMITS TO STRENGTHENING RELATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Only a handful of leaders in the Philippines, ignoring the increasing challenges, such as rising prices, at home, are stirring up the extreme sentiments of the people by feeding them anti-China rhetoric,&quot; Yang wrote. &quot;What they don’t realize is that once the &quot;Sarajevo gunshot&quot; is fired in Asia, the innocent people in East and Southeast Asian countries will become the biggest victims of war.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has most recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/defiant-fisherman-tells-chinese-coast-guard-disputed-territory-rising-tensions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;hassled the Philippines over disputed fishing shoals&lt;/a&gt;, with Chinese coast guards trying to chase Filipino fishermen away and leading to tense standoffs between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year saw a series of near-clashes between the two coast guards near the Second Thomas Shoal. The Philippine authorities protested China’s use of a water cannon and military-grade lasers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China established a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-senators-urge-biden-crack-down-chinas-maritime-militia-incidents-philippines-coast-guard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;claim to the Scarborough Shoal&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, after which the Philippines formally launched a protest that went before a United Nations-backed tribunal. A 2016 ruling went against China, rejecting Beijing’s claims on &quot;historical grounds,&quot; but Beijing rejected the arbitration and its outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-korea-launches-ballistic-missile-off-east-coast-officials&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NORTH KOREA LAUNHCES BALLISTIC MISSILE OFF ITS EAST COAST: OFFICIALS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S., Japan, Australia and the Philippines on Apr. 7 will conduct the first full-scale joint naval exercise between the nations in the disputed territories to demonstrate fleet interoperability and provide a show of strength for China. The nations will then hold a summit in which they are expected to announce plans for joint patrols in the area later this year, according to Politico. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chang argued that this kind of scattershot approach to stirring up tensions with neighboring countries is unsurprising as China &quot;is probing its neighbors, especially Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines, and it shifts its attention, all the time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;China ramped up pressure on the Philippines and then pressure … sort of died down in the last couple of days, and now they&apos;re ramping up pressure on Taiwan,&quot; Chang said. &quot;And while all of this is going on, we&apos;ve now had more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/japan-reports-chinese-warship-sightings-disputed-nautical-border&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;100 continuous days of Chinese vessels&lt;/a&gt; intruding into Japan&apos;s waters in the East China Sea around the senkakus.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So, really what they&apos;re doing is they are pressuring, and then they&apos;ll let up, and they&apos;ll go someplace else and pressure at that place,&quot; he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chang stressed, though, that the Philippines remain &quot;the weakest militarily&quot; of those three targets, despite the agreement of mutual defense with the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Biden himself, on October 25th issued a warning from the steps of the White House when the Australian prime minister was visiting him that the United States was prepared to use force, so the Chinese just don&apos;t believe Biden at all,&quot; Chang argued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are a lot of people out there who say we will be fighting China this year or next year,&quot; Chang added. &quot;I&apos;m not saying we will, but I&apos;m saying if we will, it&apos;s more likely that the fight starts over the Philippines than it starts over Taiwan or Japan.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you look at the situation involving the Philippines, it&apos;s easier to construct an argument or a scenario that we&apos;re going to go to war with [China] over the Philippines … because you got all the elements in place,&quot; he concluded. &quot;You&apos;ve got all the elements in place for a great power war that starts in the Philippines.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Trump-backed GOP Senate candidate aims to flip Dem-held seat in crucial battleground state</title>
                    
                    <description>Mike Rogers, a former FBI special agent who later served as House Intelligence Committee chair and who is now running for the Republican Senate nomination in Michigan, is backed by Donald Trump</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/r/mike-rogers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mike Rogers&lt;/a&gt; says &quot;a weak and porous southern border&quot; is fueling crime in his state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogers, a former FBI special agent who later served as House Intelligence Committee chair during his tenure in Congress and who is now running for the Republican Senate nomination in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/michigan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;battleground Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, tells Fox News Digital that the top issues in his campaign are crime, the border, security and &quot;the economy, which is in the tank.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clear front-runner in the August GOP Senate primary, Rogers will likely face off with Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin in the race to succeed longtime Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat who is not seeking re-election this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seat is one of a handful that Republicans are aiming to flip from blue to red in November, as they push to regain the Senate majority they lost in the 2020 cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-spotlights-bidens-border-bloodbath-during-stop-crucial-battleground-state-he-lost-2020&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP TARGETS PRESIDENT OVER ‘BIDEN’S BORDER BLOODBATH&apos; DURING STOP IN THIS CRUCIAL BATTLEGROUND STATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogers spoke to Fox News Digital minutes before he and other Republican leaders and law enforcement officials joined former President &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; at a roundtable discussion and stood behind him at an ensuing campaign event where the presumptive GOP presidential nominee targeted President Biden over crime and the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’ve had a murder of Ruby Garcia, a horrific murder, right here in Kent County. We’ve had criminal cartel gangs operating in Oakland and Wayne County on the southeast side of the state for months now. They’re very organized, and they’re doing a lot of damage. All of that because of a weak and porous southern border,&quot; Rogers charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-eyes-dual-strategy-flip-script-biden-legal-hurdles-have-messaging&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP&apos;S DUAL STRATEGY TO BALANCE COURT APPEARANCES WITH THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump visit came in the wake of the March 22 murder of Garcia, a 25-year-old woman allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant who had been deported to Mexico in 2020 but returned to the U.S. Garcia&apos;s death - her body was discovered alongside a road in Grand Rapids - has dominated local conservative talk radio and social media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police say Garcia was in a romantic relationship with the suspect, Brandon Ortiz-Vite, who told authorities he shot her multiple times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pointing to the roundtable discussion with law enforcement leaders who endorsed Trump minutes later, Rogers argued that they &quot;have been kicked in the teeth for the last three years by the Biden administration and Democrats. This is their opportunity to talk about real policy changes that will help them protect communities here in Michigan.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogers bowed out of politics in 2016, the year that Trump won the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/potential-2024-candidate-mike-rogers-worries-trump-indictment-is-ripping-fabric-us-apart&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROGERS FLIRTS WITH 2024 WHITE HOUSE RUN DURING EARLY STATE STOPS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He returned to the campaign trail in late 2022 and early 2023, as he flirted with a long-shot Republican presidential nomination run, road-testing his message during stops in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, the four early voting states in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/republicans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GOP nomination race&lt;/a&gt;. And part of his message was that Trump&apos;s time leading the party had passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Rogers ultimately decided against a White House bid, and last autumn, after moving back to Michigan from Florida, launched a Senate campaign after being encouraged to run by the National Republican Senatorial Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He backed Trump in the GOP presidential nomination race in January and Trump reciprocated a month ago. The former president gave Rogers another shout out in his comments to the crowd in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-rep-mike-rogers-launches-republican-senate-campaign-open-senate-seat-battleground-michigan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THIS FORMER FBI AGENT LAUNCHES SENATE RUN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogers, in his Fox News Digital interview, emphasized that &quot;Donald Trump is the right person at the right time to fix some huge problems for this country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he mulled a presidential run, Rogers was clear in rejecting Trump’s repeated unproven claims that his 2020 election loss to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt; was due to a &quot;rigged&quot; election that was &quot;stolen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked how he squared his past criticism with his current backing of Trump, Rogers said &quot;politics are like family fights. You have your family fight. You have your disagreements. You get up the next day. You dust yourself off. You move out smartly. We’re moving out smartly for a November win.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the Trump endorsement, Rogers&apos; odds of winning the GOP nomination also improved after former Detroit Police Chief James Craig dropped his Senate bid a month ago and later backed Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republican Senate field remains crowded. Among the other contenders are two vocal Trump critics — former Reps. Peter Meijer and Justin Amash, as well as entrepreneur and self-funding candidate Sandy Pensler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogers said that even with the Trump endorsement, &quot;I’m used to being 1,000 points behind every single day and that’s how we act…. We’re not taking anything for granted. We’re still trying to put the party back together, every faction of it, to make sure that we have the infrastructure to beat the Democrat machine in November.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Maeve Coyle claimed in a statement to Fox News that &quot;Republicans are engulfed in a radioactive, expensive primary that will leave their eventual nominee deeply damaged.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Coyle claimed that &quot;every day is bringing new and damaging revelations about National Republicans’ chosen candidate Revolving Door Rogers – like how he supports a national abortion ban, enriched himself through ties to Chinese businesses, and ditched Michigan to live in a million dollar Florida mansion the first chance he got.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the combustible issue of abortion, Rogers acknowledged that &quot;I’m someone who supports life and always have.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Congress over a decade ago, Rogers voted to enact federal abortion restrictions. Now he opposes such a move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And pointing to the 2022 vote by Michigan to codify reproductive rights, including access to abortion, in the state constitution, Rogers said &quot;abortion is legal here in the state of Michigan. I’m not going back to Washington D.C. to undo what I believe was rightly done by the decision… it’s part of the [state] constitution. It is protected. It’s legal. I’m not going to go back and change that at the federal level.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some Republicans who said they would never support &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; again appear poised to do just that come November, as they feel President Biden&apos;s policies and leadership cannot be allowed a second term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is not an enthusiastic vote,&quot; Eric Levine, a former Nikki Haley supporter, told Fox News Digital in an interview. &quot;I am left with no alternative.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-ripped-admitting-quiet-part-out-loud-panic-key-strategy-helping-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEMS BLASTED OVER LEAKED MEMO THAT SAYS &apos;QUIET PART OUT LOUD&apos; ABOUT VOTER REGISTRATION EFFORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levine, a prominent Republican fundraiser, penned an essay to his vast network of fellow GOP donors and activists last week, informing them that despite his initial resolve after the Jan. 6 Capitol riots to &quot;never&quot; support Trump again, he would be doing just that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He led his memo by writing, &quot;The adage of ‘never say never’ is a wise one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOP strategist John Feehery said it will depend &quot;how horrified they are by Biden’s policies&quot; whether &quot;never-Trump&quot; Republicans return to him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the case for Levine. He described his decision-making process as such: &quot;I think it was more that I&apos;m so offended by Biden. What am I going to do?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/democratic-strategist-boasts-party-fought-undermine-dangerous-third-party-threat-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST BOASTS PARTY FOUGHT TO UNDERMINE &apos;DANGEROUS&apos; THIRD-PARTY THREAT TO BIDEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Levine, it was never a choice between Biden and Trump. Rather, it was whether he would stay home on Election Day or return to Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some will clearly go back to Trump,&quot; explained Republican strategist Doug Heye. He noted this happens after primaries and is &quot;what campaigns call ‘coming home.’&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But no one knows what that number is,&quot; he added. With the likely Trump-Biden rematch shaping up to be competitive, that exact number could make the difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/no-labels-declines-field-candidate-2024-presidential-sweeps-hero-never-emerged&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO LABELS DECLINES TO FIELD CANDIDATE IN 2024 PRESIDENTIAL SWEEPS: &apos;A HERO NEVER EMERGED&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Smith, Director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, said it was &quot;too early&quot; to know, but noted that &quot;voters have a great ability to rationalize why they are voting for their party’s candidate rather than vote for the candidate from the other party.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think as we get closer to the election, after Labor Day, I believe most anti-Trump voters from the primaries will end up supporting Trump,&quot; he predicted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Levine sent the memo to his Republican network, he was surprised by the volume of responses he received. &quot;Shockingly, on the extreme of the [Never-Trumpers], it was a split,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There [were] a number of folks who said, ‘Yeah, I guess we have to&apos; [support Trump].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Trump-averse Republicans had flocked to Haley leading up to the Republican primaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-campaign-puts-politico-notice-false-reporting-china-wants-45-back-wh-harebrained&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP CAMPAIGN RIPS POLITICO FOR &apos;HAREBRAINED ASSERTION&apos; THAT CHINA PREFERS HIM OVER BIDEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to various exit polls in New Hampshire and South Carolina, Haley pulled in significant percentages of independent voters as she appeared more moderate than her opponents on the campaign trail. Her coalition was unique, garnering support from disaffected Republicans who were likely exhausted by Trump. She even managed to draw some Democratic support in some states, where those voters could participate in Republican primaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, endorsed Haley ahead of the state&apos;s primary, where she garnered 43% of the vote. But In March, he shocked some when he announced his plan to vote for Trump, despite his previous criticisms of the former president. &quot;Post-primary, the vast majority of folks always come back,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People will go to Trump because Biden has blown it that bad for himself and his party,&quot; he said. According to him, they recognize that it&apos;s about &quot;whether you support a Republican agenda — a Republican administration.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden&apos;s campaign has actively sought to win over Haley&apos;s supporters. The president&apos;s team even put out a 30-second ad in battleground states asking those voters to &quot;save America&quot; and &quot;join us.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Trump&apos;s campaign hasn&apos;t made any such specific effort to attract Haley&apos;s coalition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Telling your own voters to pound sand isn’t smart,&quot; noted Heye. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to Fox News Digital, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said, &quot;No amount of gaslighting from the Biden campaign can make voters forget Biden&apos;s bloodbath he has brought all across America.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Biden is hemorrhaging support from Black voters, Hispanic voters, and almost every other part of his base because of his disastrous policies and failed presidency. Meanwhile, President Trump&apos;s support continues to grow,&quot; he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-trump-pa-poll-concern-too-old-second-term&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN HOLDS NARROW LEAD OVER TRUMP IN NEW POLL DESPITE CONCERNS HE&apos;S &apos;TOO OLD&apos; FOR A SECOND TERM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marlys Popma, a prominent Iowa Republican operative who endorsed Haley during the Iowa caucuses, said Trump&apos;s lack of outreach may not put off Haley supporters because &quot;when the hardcore reality sets in&quot; people will say, &quot;&apos;I&apos;m going to vote for Trump because his policies are right.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levine said he couldn&apos;t imagine Republicans who supported Haley choosing Biden in November. &quot;I don&apos;t see how any Nikki Haley voter can go from Nikki Haley to Joe Biden,&quot; he said. &quot;Everything Nikki Haley stands for, Joe Biden is against.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Republican strategist David Kochel, a former adviser to Mitt Romney, offered another prediction: &quot;I think a big number will either not vote in the presidential or will vote for Biden or a third party.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gunner Ramer, Republican Accountability PAC political director, called it &quot;disappointing yet unsurprising&quot; to see a &quot;member of the GOP elite&quot; cowering and supporting Trump, in reference to Levine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramer&apos;s organization recently launched an anti-Trump series of ads in pivotal Midwest swing states as it looks to prevent him from winning a second term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A pro-Palestinian student at Mercer University in Georgia was arrested after making physical contact with a conservative speaker discussing the Israel-Hamas war.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A pro-Palestinian student at a private university in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/georgia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Macon, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, was arrested after making physical contact with a conservative speaker delivering a speech on campus about the Israel-Hamas war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mercer University&lt;/a&gt; student Savannah Grace O’Brien was arrested Thursday by campus police on simple battery charges after making physical contact with Atlas Society CEO Jennifer Grossman, who appeared to be speaking in support of Israel, according to WMAZ-TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atlas Society is a conservative nonprofit that promotes the philosophy of author and philosopher Ayn Rand, whose works include Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Brien was booked into the Bibb County Jail on Friday and released on $650 bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-college-president-cracks-down-protesting-pro-palestinian-students-immediate-suspension&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PRESIDENT CRACKS DOWN ON PROTESTING PRO-PALESTINIAN STUDENTS: &apos;IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A video of the incident posted on social media by the Atlas Society showed the student, who was wrapped in pro-Palestinian and transgender flags and wearing a mask, disrupting Grossman’s speech after taking issue with her stance on the Israel-Hamas war and her previous work as senior vice president of fruit and vegetable company Dole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The student approached Grossman at the front of the auditorium and interrupted her speech. The student then criticized Dole&apos;s labor and business practices and put hands on Grossman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A campus police officer was seen escorting the student from the room after the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;America used to be better than this,&quot; the Atlas Society wrote on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pro-palestinian-protest-breaks-out-inside-senate-office-building-interrupts-interview-cease-fire-chants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTEST BREAKS OUT INSIDE SENATE OFFICE BUILDING, INTERRUPTS INTERVIEW WITH CEASE-FIRE CHANTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercer said in a statement that it is reviewing the incident and will take action &quot;as warranted.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Disrupting and invading the personal space of a speaker is not acceptable,&quot; the university said. &quot;It is our hope this will ultimately prove to be a positive learning experience for the student.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speech was held at Mercer University’s Willet Auditorium and was hosted by the university&apos;s chapter of the conservative group Turning Point U.S.A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many pro-Palestinian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-protests&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;protests and disruptions&lt;/a&gt; have happened at U.S. colleges and universities since Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, leading to a retaliatory military response from Israeli forces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Two principals in Texas were charged for allegedly violating state election laws by using their school emails to urge staff to vote for candidates who oppose school vouchers.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two principals in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Texas school district&lt;/a&gt; are facing criminal charges after allegedly violating state election laws by using their school emails to urge staff to vote for candidates who oppose school choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander Elementary School Principal Lindsey Lujan and Borman Elementary Principal Jesus Lujan, who are married, work in the Denton Independent School District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two administrators emailed staff in February encouraging them to vote in March&apos;s Republican primary election for candidates who oppose GOP Gov. Greg Abbott&apos;s school voucher plan, court documents show, according to Fox 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-ag-ken-paxton-sues-school-district-after-principals-accused-violating-election-laws&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEXAS AG KEN PAXTON SUES SCHOOL DISTRICT AFTER PRINCIPALS ACCUSED OF VIOLATING ELECTION LAWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Denton ISD&lt;/a&gt; in response to the emails, which were leaked in February. Paxton&apos;s office and the school district later reached a settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principals were charged with unlawful use of an internal mail system for political advertising, a Class A misdemeanor. The charge carries a maximum penalty of up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas American Federation of Teachers, a teachers union, claimed the charges represent a &quot;politically motivated legal attack.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/texas-university-clears-dei-offices-lays-off-employees-light-new-state-law-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEXAS UNIVERSITY CLEARS DEI OFFICES, LAYS OFF EMPLOYEES IN LIGHT OF NEW STATE LAW: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This latest escalation in the campaign against educators and school employees fulfilling their duty to promote civic engagement and using their voices to highlight the high stakes for public education in our elections threatens to have a profound chilling effect in communities across the state,&quot; Texas AFT said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;election &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;laws &lt;/a&gt;should be followed, but also encouraged people to learn about the candidates and their positions before voting in the primary of their choosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A court hearing for Lindsay Lujan is scheduled for next month while her husband’s hearing is set for June.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Drake Bell says he&apos;s forgiven Rider Strong after letter of support for his abuser: &apos;Healing together&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Drake Bell revealed that he has forgiven Rider Strong. The Nickelodeon star previously called out the &amp;quot;Boy Meets World&amp;quot; alum for supporting Bell&amp;apos;s convicted abuser Brian Peck.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Drake Bell revealed that he has forgiven Rider Strong for his past support of the Nickelodeon star&apos;s convicted abuser, Brian Peck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being convicted of sexually abusing a child in 2004, Peck was sentenced to 16 months in prison and ordered to register as a sex offender. Last month, Bell, now 37, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/drake-bell-claims-sexual-abuse-nickelodeon-convicted-sex-offender&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;publicly identified himself&lt;/a&gt; as the victim in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Bell called out Strong, 44, for being among the actors who wrote letters of support for Peck during the former acting and dialogue coach&apos;s trial.  However, &quot;The Amanda Show&quot; alum shared an update on his relationship with Strong on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I just had the most amazing conversation with @RiderStrong we are all healing together. I have nothing but love and forgiveness for him,&quot; Bell wrote on X, formerly Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell broke his silence in the Investigation Discovery docuseries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/quiet-on-set-directors-say-they-were-clear-with-participants-after-marc-summers-ambush-allegations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; which premiered last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/nickelodeon-star-drake-bell-blasts-boy-meets-world-stars-supporting-abuser-in-past-trial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NICKELODEON STAR DRAKE BELL BLASTS ‘BOY MEETS WORLD’ STARS FOR SUPPORTING ABUSER IN PAST TRIAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The docuseries shared unsealed court documents from Peck’s trial, which contained letters supporting the convicted sex offender from Strong and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/boy-meets-world-star-rider-strong-says-was-very-upset-shows-handling-sex-prom-episode&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Boy Meets World&quot;&lt;/a&gt; co-star Will Friedle as well as other actors including James Marsden, Taran Killam, and the late Alan Thicke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Nikolas, a fellow Nickelodeon child star and participant in the documentary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C4fLmUrOzDl/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;shared a post on Instagram&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; slamming Strong and Friedle, and Bell replied to fans&apos; comments implying they were victims of Peck as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;RIDER WAS 24 years old when he wrote the letter and was told by Brian what he did. He wrote the letter anyway,&quot; Bell wrote in a series of comments that have since been deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate reply, he wrote, &quot;Will was 27 years old and Brian told him what he did many people turned away and said no I won’t write a letter but they did,&quot; Bell wrote. &quot;Will was not manipulated. Brian admitted it to him and he wrote the letter anyway.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then he [Friedle] worked with me on many many episodes of [&apos;Ultimate Spider-Man&apos;] years later and never said a word to me about it,&quot; Bell continued. &quot;This is because they were told there letters are going to be made public. Everyone thought the letters would be sealed forever and no one would ever see them. This is their publicist telling them how to get ahead of the story.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Friedle and Strong &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/boy-meets-world-actors-felt-shame-manipulative-friendship-convicted-child-abuser&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;addressed their support of Peck&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on their podcast, &quot;Pod Meets World,&quot; ahead of the release of details about the &quot;Quiet on Set&quot; documentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&apos;s no way I could have been manipulated like this because I was an adult,&quot; Friedle said. &quot;By the time I had heard what had happened, I had known this man for years and years, had no idea that any of this was going on, obviously, and the idea that now at 24 or whatever I was, 24 or 25 when I found out about it – that I didn&apos;t know, couldn&apos;t spot it – that was a failure of my own.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong remembered Peck admitting to the crime but spinning the assault so that it appeared as though Peck was the victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was always in the context of, ‘I did this thing, I am guilty. I am going to take whatever punishment the government determines, but I’m a victim of jailbait. There was this hot guy. I just did this thing, and he’s underage.’ And we bought that storyline,&quot; Strong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peck was accused of molesting a child in 2003 and was later charged with eight counts of sexual abuse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell was referred to as &quot;John Doe&quot; throughout the investigation and trial. Peck was convicted of a lewd act against a child and oral copulation of a person under the age of 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Elizabeth Stanton contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>WrestleMania 40 Night 2 preview: Cody Rhodes clashes with Roman Reigns for WWE Undisputed Universal Title</title>
                    
                    <description>Cody Rhodes will look to finish history on Sunday on the second night of WrestleMania 40 as he takes on Roman Reigns for the WWE Undisputed Universal Championship.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/wwe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WrestleMania Night 2&lt;/a&gt; is on deck after an electrifying Night 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was epic to say the least. Roman Reigns and The Rock were the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/wwe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;big winners of Night 1&lt;/a&gt;, scoring a victory over Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reigns will set the record for most WrestleMania main events in history. But it will be far from the only major match on the card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what fans can expect on Night 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s Bloodline Rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After The Rock and Roman Reigns topped Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins on Night 1, the WWE Undisputed Universal Championship match will be under Bloodline Rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was far from an easy match. The four competitors were in a slobberknocker all-out fight. Rhodes put The Rock through the announce table. Reigns speared Rollins and injured his knee during the match. Scars were left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It won’t be easy for Reigns or Rhodes. Both were beaten and battered. Reigns will have The Bloodline in his corner while Rhodes might have to find someone who isn’t bruised to help keep Reigns’ family at bay come Sunday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seth Rollins will already be coming off of a grueling tag-team match with Rhodes against Reigns and The Rock. He is a little bit more hurt than he would have liked to be going up against a behemoth like Drew McIntyre. Rollins tweaked his knee during his loss against Reigns and The Rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McIntyre has been on Rollins’ case for weeks. With some help, he came through to win the Elimination Chamber to get a shot at Rollins’ World Heavyweight Championship, which &quot;The Visionary&quot; has held since it was revealed to be Raw’s top crown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With CM Punk likely to be at ringside to call the match, McIntyre’s focus could be elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WWE gold has eluded McIntyre since he lost to Reigns at Clash at the Castle in 2022 and then the Intercontinental Championship at WrestleMania 39. Could he leave Philly with Rollins’ title on Sunday?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayley founded Damage CTRL and helped Iyo Sky cash in her Money in the Bank briefcase at SummerSlam to win the title from Bianca Belair. Sky has been the champion ever since. But after Bayley won the Royal Rumble match, everything changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sky, Asuka and Kairi Sane turned on Bayley. Just when Bayley thought she had a friend in Dakota Kai, she turned on her too. Bayley seems to be on her own as she goes up against Sky in the biggest match of her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayley could become a three-time SmackDown Women’s Champion if she manages to defeat Sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nick-khan-ushers-wwes-renaissance-era-support-cody-rhodes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NICK KHAN USHERS IN WWE&apos;S &apos;RENAISSANCE ERA&apos; WITH SUPPORT FROM CODY RHODES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At WrestleMania 39, Logan Paul lost to Rollins to put an end to their feud. Kevin Owens won the Undisputed Tag Team Championship with Sami Zayn over The Usos. Randy Orton was still recovering from a serious back injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul defeated Rey Mysterio to win the U.S. title and nearly earned a shot at Rollins’ title in the Elimination Chamber back in February. He ended up costing Orton a chance at the belt. At the Royal Rumble, Paul cheated to defeat Owens to retain his title, causing a clear grievance with him as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis pit the three up against each other in a three-way match for the title. It will be one of the more interesting matches on the card between the two nights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LA Knight has a summer emergence. Behind a wave of fan support, he turned a feud against The Miz and set his sights on Reigns and the WWE Undisputed Universal Championship. If it wasn’t for The Bloodline, he may have been in the main event at this year’s ‘Mania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, he found himself the target of a revenge plot by Styles. The &quot;Phenomenal One&quot; attacked Knight for taking his spot in a tag-team match at Fastlane which saw Knight and John Cena take out Jimmy Uso and Solo Sikoa. The Bloodline had put Styles on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Styles came back in December and immediately had it out for Knight. The two participated in a fatal four way for the Undisputed Universal Championship at the Royal Rumble but Reigns retained. Styles then cost Knight a title shot in the Elimination Chamber match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knight and Styles were also in an angle in which they brawled on Styles’ front lawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all led to the match on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the final matches set on the WrestleMania card was a 6-man tag-team Philadelphia street fight match between The Pride, consisting of Bobby Lashley, Montez Ford and Angelo Dawkins against The Final Testament, consisting of Karrion Kross, Akam and Rezer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akam and Rezer, known as the Authors of Pain, returned WWE at the beginning of the year and backed Kross in his crusade against The Pride. The two groups have feuded since then with The Final Testament attacking Bobby Lashley and his valet B-Fab while Ford and Dawkins were trying to earn a shot at the 6-pack ladder match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grayson Waller and Austin Theory took advantage and defeated Ford and Dawkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The street fight was announced soon after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Former President Donald Trump’s GOP fundraiser in Palm Beach, Florida, rakes in more than $50 million</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former President &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s campaign team says it raised more than $50 million at a Saturday evening’s GOP fundraiser in Palm Beach, Florida, smashing records for a Republican or Democratic candidate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It took three Democrat presidents to raise $25 million and one president to raise over $50 million, Donald J. Trump,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/campaigning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;campaign spokesperson&lt;/a&gt; Danielle Alvarez boasted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday’s fundraiser took place at a private home in Palm Beach, hosted by billionaire and hedge fund founder John Paulson. Among the 100 or so guests will be heavy-hitters like casino mogul Steve Wynn, Bigelow Aerospace Founder and President Robert Bigelow, and former U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The response to our fundraising efforts has been overwhelming, and we&apos;ve raised over $43 million so far,&quot; Paulson said in a statement. &quot;There is massive support amongst a broad spectrum of donors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking briefly to reporters as he arrived at the event with his wife, Melania Trump, the former president said, &quot;this has been some incredible evening before it even starts because people – they wanted to contribute to a cause of making America great again, and that&apos;s waht&apos;s happened.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the fundraiser is expected to take in tens of millions, Trump still needs to close the gap with his Democratic rival, incumbent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt;, who is reported to have around $192 million on hand compared with just over $93 million for Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden’s campaign said he raised more than $26 million during a fundraising appearance late last month at New York City’s famed Radio City Music Hall with former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aclu-threatens-sue-georgia-election-bill-conservatives-praise-commonsense-reform&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACLU THREATENS TO SUE GEORGIA OVER ELECTION BILL CONSERVATIVES PRAISE AS ‘COMMONSENSE’ REFORM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;re-election campaign&lt;/a&gt; called the money raised at the star-studded event — which set a record for a single fundraiser — &quot;historic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s event, billed as the &quot;Inaugural Leadership Dinner,&quot; sends a signal of a resurgence for the former president and Republican Party fundraising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump initially struggled to attract big donors when he launched his campaign and some lined up to support the other Republicans who challenged him in the presidential primary. But as Trump racked up easy wins, leveled the field and became the party&apos;s presumptive nominee, the GOP has solidified behind him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributions to the event will go toward the Trump 47 Committee, according to the invitation, a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee, state Republican parties and Save America, a political action committee that pays the bulk of Trump&apos;s legal bills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an unusual arrangement, the fundraising agreement directs donations to first pay the maximum allowed under law to his campaign and Save America before the RNC or state parties get a cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guests are asked to contribute $814,600 per person as a &quot;chairman&quot; contributor, which comes with seating at Trump&apos;s table, or $250,000 per person as a &quot;host committee&quot; contributor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both options come with a photo opportunity and a personalized copy of Trump&apos;s coffee table book featuring photographs from his administration, &quot;Our Journey Together.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of Trump&apos;s former rivals for the GOP nomination — South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy — are expected to appear as &quot;special guests.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Iowa&apos;s close win over UConn in women&apos;s Final Four draws record ratings</title>
                    
                    <description>Earlier this week, Iowa played in a record-setting Elite Eight game, but the Hawkeyes&amp;apos; matchup with UConn drew even more viewers Friday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Women&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk/march-madness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;college basketball&lt;/a&gt; continues to captivate the nation&apos;s attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a few days ago, the rematch of last year&apos;s NCAA Division I women&apos;s basketball national championship between LSU and Iowa drew more than 12 million viewers. It became the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/caitlin-clark-iowa-lsu-march-madness-matchup-record-ratings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;most watched women&apos;s college basketball&lt;/a&gt; game on record — until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 9.9 million viewers tuned in last year to watch the Angel Reese-led Tigers defeat Caitlin Clark and the Hawkeyes in the championship game. ESPN revealed that Iowa&apos;s narrow win over the UConn Huskies drew a record-shattering 14.2 million viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game became ESPN&apos;s most watched college basketball game in history — men&apos;s or women&apos;s. The game peaked at around 17 million viewers, according to ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/controversial-call-iowa-narrow-victory-uconn-draws-fiery-reaction&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONTROVERSIAL CALL IN IOWA&apos;S NARROW VICTORY OVER UCONN DRAWS FIERY REACTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday&apos;s Final Four started with the undefeated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/south-carolina-dominates-nc-state-reach-womens-basketball-national-title-game&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;South Carolina Gamecocks&lt;/a&gt; going against North Carolina State. ESPN noted that an average of 7.1 million tuned in to watch South Carolina eliminate N.C. State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viewers were treated to a thrilling game that featured some of the most recognizable stars in the sport. But a late-game sequence sparked controversy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A costly turnover with just a minute remaining led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/connecticut-huskies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;UConn guard&lt;/a&gt; Nika Muhl’s 3-pointer to cut into Iowa&apos;s lead. The Huskies trailed by just one point with just under ten seconds remaining and had possession. But with just 3.9 seconds left and a 70-69 lead for Iowa, UConn&apos;s Aaliyah Edwards was called for an illegal screen on Iowa&apos;s Gabbie Marshall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edwards was setting a pick to presumably set up Paige Bueckers for a potential game-winning shot. But the offensive foul call resulted in a turnover, and UConn never got the ball back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edwards later said referees did not offer an explanation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wasn’t given an explanation,&quot; she said after the game. &quot;There was no real time to get an explanation. From my point of view, it was pretty clean.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iowa and South Carolina play for the NCAA women&apos;s national championship Sunday at 3 p.m. ET in what could be another record-setting meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>New Jersey Gov Phil Murphy faces flak for not returning to state following historic earthquake</title>
                    
                    <description>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy came under fire after he did not return to the Garden State following the historic earthquake on Friday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy&lt;/a&gt; came under fire after he did not return to the Garden State following the historic earthquake on Friday that left residents rattled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., spoke with &quot;FOX News Live&quot; on Saturday after Murphy did not issue an on-camera address to residents, despite a few TV and phone interviews, including an interview Saturday with CBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We haven’t heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/governors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;from the governor&lt;/a&gt; — and you know, on a lighter side, Arthel, there are those that say maybe it’s good he didn’t come, because every time he’s in New Jersey, he’s increasing taxes, tolls, fees and subsidizing illegals,&quot; Van Drew told &quot;FOX News Live&quot; co-anchor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/n/arthel-neville&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Arthel Neville&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But on a serious note, he wasn’t at a world summit for world peace. I mean he was at a Democratic convention — basically an association of democratic governors who were probably working on ways to make more democratic governors,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/earthquake-strikes-new-jersey-shaking-buildings-surrounding-states&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.8 MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE STRIKES NEW JERSEY, SHAKING BUILDINGS IN SURROUNDING STATES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Drew said that residents were forced to look to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York leadership&lt;/a&gt; for guidance during the natural disaster — rather than their own governor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So I think he could have taken maybe even 12 hours out to come back to New Jersey. Our folks in New Jersey really had to look to New York — to New York officials — and what they were saying,&quot; Van Drew said. &quot;Even though the actual earthquake was centered in Lebanon, New Jersey, in the northwestern part of the state.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/republicans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Republican representative&lt;/a&gt; said Murphy could have easily traveled back to his state to assure residents that they were safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It would have been a nice symbol if he came back and said, ‘you know what, everything’s going to be OK. I want to personally review the infrastructure myself, see what the team has done, and then he could have gotten back to the convention, the association that he was at,&quot; Van Drew said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6350364594112&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOX WEATHER SPEAKS TO NJ RESIDENTS FROM THE EARTHQUAKE&apos;S EPICENTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So I personally was a little disappointed that he didn’t make it. It’s just good for people to know that their leaders are there during times of problems,&quot; he said. &quot;And even though, in, you know, the world scheme of earthquakes, with what California sees or some other states — this was not huge — it was the biggest earthquake the state of New Jersey has had almost in a century and a half. I wish he had been there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News has reached out to Murphy&apos;s office for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, the governor wrote on X that the state&apos;s emergency operations center was deactivated on Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our State Emergency Operations Center has deactivated as of 10:00 a.m. today,&quot; Murphy wrote. &quot;We have had no reports &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/earthquakes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;of major damage&lt;/a&gt; to structures, roadways, or infrastructure as a result of yesterday’s earthquake.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earthquake measured at least 4.8 magnitude and struck near Lebanon, New Jersey, at 10:23 a.m. on Friday, about 45 miles west of New York City and 50 miles north of Philadelphia, according to the USGS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimate indicates the quake might have been felt by more than 42 million people in 14 states from Maine to North Carolina. More than two-dozen aftershocks have been felt since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 152,000 Americans reported feeling shaking to the USGS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
