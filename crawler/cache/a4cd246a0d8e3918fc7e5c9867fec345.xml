                    <description>An attack on a prison convoy in northwestern France has left two prison officers dead and three others seriously injured, according to French authorities.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Armed assailants killed two French &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;prison officers&lt;/a&gt; and seriously wounded three others in an attack on a convoy in Normandy on Tuesday and an inmate escaped, officials said. A search was underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The convoy was transporting prisoner Mohamed Amra to Évreux jail after a court hearing in Rouen when it was ambushed on the A154 freeway, which has been closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All means are being used to find these criminals. On my instructions, several hundred police officers and gendarmes were mobilized,&quot; Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin posted on social platform X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/ohio-police-officer-military-veteran-killed-line-duty-ambush-suspect-at-large&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OHIO POLICE OFFICER, MILITARY VETERAN KILLED IN LINE-OF-DUTY AMBUSH, SUSPECT FOUND DEAD: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French President Emmanuel Macron in a post on X called the attack &quot;a shock for all of us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities worked to secure the area in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/france&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;northwestern France&lt;/a&gt; and apprehend the assailants. It was not clear how many were involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amra was detained at the Val de Reuil prison center near Rouen following his recent sentencing for burglary. He was also under investigation for a kidnapping and homicide case in Marseille, according to public prosecutor Laure Beccuau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French media reported that Amra was nicknamed &quot;La Mouche&quot; (The Fly).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beccuau announced an investigation into the attack, considered a case of organized crime and murder, and said two of the wounded officers were in critical condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation will also address organized escape attempts, possession of military-grade weapons and conspiracy to commit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a crime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>In Pakistan, a drone-launched missile hit a house in a former Pakistani Taliban stronghold near the Afghan border on Tuesday, killing at least four villagers.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A missile fired by a drone struck a house in a former stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban in northwestern Pakistan along the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/afghanistan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Afghan border&lt;/a&gt; before dawn Tuesday, killing at least four villagers, including children, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strike happened in South Waziristan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, local police chief Hidayat Ullah said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it was not immediately clear who fired the missile and officers were investigating. The Pakistan army evicted Pakistani Taliban insurgents from the region years ago, but they have been regrouping there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/pakistan-us-discuss-how-tackle-regional-security-threat-posed-is-group-local-taliban&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAKISTAN, US DISCUSS HOW TO TACKLE THE REGIONAL SECURITY THREAT POSED BY IS GROUP AND LOCAL TALIBAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those killed in the missile strike were civilians with no known links to the insurgents. Villagers put their bodies on a road near a military camp and protested the killings and demanded information about who was responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the previous drone strikes in the area were carried out by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; or the Pakistan army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no immediate comment from the government or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the military&lt;/a&gt; about the strike. The Pakistani Taliban, officially known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, is separate from but a close ally of the Afghan Taliban. It has been emboldened by the Afghan Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Trump could get Congressional Gold Medal under new House GOP resolution</title>
                    
                    <description>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna introduced a new resolution on Tuesday to give former President Trump the Congressional Gold Medal.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST ON FOX:&lt;/strong&gt; A group of House Republicans wants to award former President Trump the Congressional Gold Medal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., is leading a Congressional resolution to bestow the honor on Trump &quot;in recognition of his exceptional leadership and dedication to strengthening America&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/president-trump-foreign-policy-pledges&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;diplomatic relations&lt;/a&gt; during his presidency,&quot; according to legislative text obtained by Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is backed by six fellow House Republicans, including House GOP Deputy Whip Guy Reschenthaler of Pennsylvania, and Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Andy Ogles of Tennessee, Randy Weber of Texas and Mike Waltz of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/may-14-trump-trial-new-york-michael-cohen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL COHEN TESTIMONY TO CONTINUE AFTER EX-LAWYER REVEALS SECRET RECORDINGS OF TRUMP IN NY TRIAL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;President Trump’s fearless leadership reestablished America as a respected and admired global power,&quot; Luna told Fox News Digital. &quot;It is time we recognize a president who put our country first and secured global peace through bold diplomacy. Despite the liberal media&apos;s attempts to spread fear, America and the world were undoubtedly safer under President Donald Trump. One of our duties in Congress is to honor those who have contributed significantly to our nation, and that’s why I’m introducing this legislation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, it is also co-sponsored by House Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good, R-Va., who had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-backs-challenger-freedom-caucus-chair-2024-stirs-house-gop-civil-war&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;rocky relationship&lt;/a&gt; with some members of Trump&apos;s orbit earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/massive-trump-beach-rally-deep-blue-nj-draws-stark-contrast-bidens-beach-weekend-biden-could-never&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MASSIVE TRUMP BEACH RALLY IN DEEP-BLUE NJ DRAWS STARK CONTRAST TO BIDEN&apos;S BEACH WEEKEND: &apos;BIDEN COULD NEVER&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good originally endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president before backing Trump when the former dropped out. He has since emphatically thrown himself behind the ex-president&apos;s re-election bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;President Trump did more in four years on behalf of the American people than any president in my lifetime. He secured our border, achieved historic peace in the Middle East, and implemented policies that helped our economy prosper,&quot; said Good. &quot;The last three years of a failed Biden administration have only served as a stark contrast to President Trump&apos;s record.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Ogles hailed Trump&apos;s &quot;contributions to the American heritage and stalwart defense of the American way of life&quot; and Weber said &quot;every patriotic American knows our country was unequivocally better off four years ago under his stewardship.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-highly-conflicted-judge-after-first-day-michael-cohens-testimony-wraps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP BLASTS &apos;HIGHLY CONFLICTED&apos; JUDGE AFTER MICHAEL COHEN&apos;S FIRST DAY OF TESTIMONY WRAPS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is highly unlikely that the Democrat-controlled Senate will take the bill up, but it is more evidence that Trump remains the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-push-rename-dc-international-airport-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;de facto leader&lt;/a&gt; of the GOP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian award in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Fox News Digital reached out to McIlroy’s attorney for further comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rory and Erica started dating in 2015 after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/golf/pga-tour&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;PGA Tour&lt;/a&gt; star and tennis star Caroline Wozniacki broke off their engagement in May 2014.

She was seen by his side at several tournaments, including last year’s Ryder Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/scottie-scheffler-wife-meredith-welcome-baby-boy-ahead-pga-championship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER, WIFE MEREDITH WELCOME BABY BOY AHEAD OF PGA CHAMPIONSHIP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Northern Irishman is fresh off of a win at the Wells Fargo Championship and is building momentum heading into the PGA Championship this weekend. He also won the Zurch Classic with Shane Lowry in a playoff back in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has 26 wins on the PGA Tour, including the two in 2024. He has four major victories, with the last one coming in the 2014 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/golf/pga-championship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;PGA Championship&lt;/a&gt;. He has two of those titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McIlroy is also in the middle of the PGA Tour’s squabble with LIV Golf. He resigned from the PGA Tour board in November as officials tried to work on a merger agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Mudslinging candidates in heated House race face voters on big primary day</title>
                    
                    <description>Voters will determine the Republican nominee in a heated race for Congress in West Virginia that&amp;apos;s seen the top two candidates lob major attacks at one another.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Candidates in a heated House race gaining national attention are facing the will of voters today as one aims to make history and the other tries to keep his family&apos;s legacy alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veteran Air Force Brig. Gen. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/veteran-air-force-pilot-joins-race-congress-moment-too-important-career-politicians&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chris &quot;Mookie&quot; Walker&lt;/a&gt; and West Virginia state Treasurer Riley Moore, the top two candidates in a crowded Republican primary for West Virginia&apos;s deep-red 2nd Congressional District, have battled for months to win over the large majority of conservative voters in the district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker, a Republican who was the first Black man to hold a general&apos;s rank in the West Virginia National Guard, would likely also be the first Black man from the state elected to Congress if he wins Tuesday&apos;s primary, while Moore, whose family includes a number of former elected officials, would secure a continuation of that political legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/racial-slur-alleged-threat-execute-man-top-five-wackiest-moments-top-democrat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RACIAL SLUR, ALLEGED THREAT TO ‘EXECUTE’ MAN: WATCH MOST OUTRAGEOUS MOMENTS FROM THIS DEM SENATE CANDIDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker has sought to paint Moore as part of a &quot;political dynasty,&quot; calling for West Virginians to send a non-career politician &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/washington-dc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look, I respect Riley Moore. I appreciate what he&apos;s done in state government as the state treasurer, but in my opinion, and a lot of people&apos;s opinions, dynasties don&apos;t work. Just because his grandfather was a former governor doesn&apos;t make him best qualified,&quot; he told Fox News Digital ahead of his campaign launch in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think that this moment is too important to send another career politician to Washington, D.C. Again, I&apos;m a pugilist. For all the things that are important to West Virginians, I will be the thorn in the side of the left, whereas others are, I think, going to just be there meekly casting votes,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-hopes-flipping-senate-democrats-major-roadblock-biden-swing-state-trouble-polls&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN FACING UPHILL BATTLE IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES AS DOWN-BALLOT DEMS LEAD: POLL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore, on the other hand, has largely ignored Walker on the campaign trail, instead focusing on his campaign&apos;s America First message and pledges to stand up against the policies being pushed by Democrats and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden administration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker and Moore have run neck-and-neck on dollars spent on the race, while the former has tried to gain the advantage by tying the latter to his time working in the &quot;swamp&quot; of Washington, D.C., an often-used line to blast career politicians and those with deep ties to government-related work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Walker criticized Moore for his time working as a lobbyist at the controversial – and now-defunct – Podesta Group, claiming he represented &quot;dictators and despots and anti-American zealots,&quot; including the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-veepstakes-pros-cons-south-dakota-governor-kristi-noem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP VEEPSTAKES: THE PROS AND CONS OF SOUTH DAKOTA GOV. KRISTI NOEM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears no evidence exists linking Moore to any work directly with the CCP, although it has been reported that the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, a client of the Podesta Group at the time of Moore&apos;s employment, was heavily influenced by party members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore&apos;s campaign pushed back on Walker&apos;s claims, accusing him of lying. It also accused Walker of lying about his service in the Air Force, claiming he never flew in combat. Walker, in fact, served extensively in combat, according to military records reviewed by Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;West Virginians should vote for me for one simple reason – values. I spent my life defending America around the globe, and I&apos;ve run this campaign on that record of service and sacrifice. My opponent has only ever looked out for himself. We deserve so much better,&quot; Walker told Fox News Digital on Tuesday as voters headed to the polls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Riley Moore is the only proven conservative in this race, with a record of fighting and winning for West Virginians. They know him, they trust him, and they’re ready to send him to Congress, where he’ll fight for them every single day,&quot; a spokesperson for Moore told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker and Moore face a crowded Republican primary field that includes Army veterans Dennis Cain and Joseph Early, as well as Alexander Gaaserud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winner of Tuesday&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/republicans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Republican primary&lt;/a&gt; will be the heavy favorite to win the November general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polls close at 7:30 p.m. ET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Steve Carell, John Krasinski reveal whether they will return to ‘The Office’ spinoff at premiere of &apos;IF’</title>
                    
                    <description>Michael Scott and John Krasinski reveal whether they will appear in &amp;quot;The Office&amp;quot; spinoff as their original characters Michael and Jim at the premiere of &amp;quot;IF.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A spinoff of the popular television series &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/sitcom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;The Office&quot;&lt;/a&gt; was recently announced, causing fans to speculate whether any original cast members will make an appearance on the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a recent interview on the red carpet at the movie premiere of &quot;IF,&quot; Steve Carell, who played the beloved Michael Scott, and John Krasinski, who appeared as Jim Halpert, set the record straight on if fans should expect a cameo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The verdict?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/most-anticipated-movies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘IF’, ‘THE KARATE KID’, ‘DEADPOOL 3’ AND OTHER HIGHLY ANTICIPATED FILMS OF 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I will be watching, but I will not be showing up. It’s just a new thing and there’s really no reason for my character [Michael Scott] to show up in something like that,&quot; Carell told The Hollywood Reporter on Monday. &quot;But I’m excited about it, it sounds like a great conceit. I love the idea — I guess it’s set in a failing newspaper company, and I worked with Domhnall Gleeson, who is one of the leads; I did [2022 series] ‘The Patient’ with him, and he’s an excellent actor and a super nice guy, so I think it’ll be great.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krasinski was not as direct with his answer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As of now, I haven&apos;t been asked,&quot; Krasinski shared with ET on the &quot;IF&quot; premiere red carpet. &quot;But the truth is I&apos;d do anything for Greg Daniels, it sounds like they have a really fun idea.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m actually working with Domhnall Gleeson right now in Guy Ritchie&apos;s movie,&quot; Krasinski told the outlet. &quot;He&apos;s so good, and he&apos;s so sweet - he&apos;s going to crush in the show.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/john-krasinski-other-cast-members-office-received-ivy-league-education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOHN KRASINSKI AND OTHER CAST MEMBERS OF ‘THE OFFICE’ WHO RECEIVED AN IVY LEAGUE EDUCATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spinoff, set in the same universe as Dunder Mifflin, is co-created by Greg Daniels, who also co-created &quot;The Office&quot; and Michael Koman, co-creator of the series &quot;Nathan for You.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Gleeson, Sabrina Impacciatore, who is widely known for her role in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;season two of &quot;The White Lotus,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; is also set to star in the spinoff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While an &quot;Office&quot; reunion with original castmembers does not seem to be in the cards for the spinoff, Krasinski and Carell did have a reunion of their own for the new movie &quot;IF.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movie, hitting theaters on May 17, was directed by Krasinski. Carell stars in the film as the voice of Blue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He directed some episodes of&lt;i&gt; &apos;&lt;/i&gt;The Office’ so I was familiar with him as a director, and he’s a great director — he’s very thorough, he’s smart, and he knows how to work with actors because he is one,&quot; Carell told The Hollywood Reporter. &quot;It was just a joy from beginning to end and I jumped at the chance to work with him again, partly just to be with him. He’s a good friend and I hadn’t seem him in a while, so it was nice to catch up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film stars a number of A-list celebs who have lent their voices to the many imaginary friend characters in the movie, including Kraskinski&apos;s wife, Emily Blunt, Blake Lively, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Matt Damon and Awkwafina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ryan Reynolds also stars in &quot;IF,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; alongside Cailey Fleming. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Asher Sullivan&amp;apos;s father, a superintendent in a Tennessee school district, said the &amp;quot;recovery does not seem possible&amp;quot; for his 10-yearr-old son, who was sucked into a storm drain during a freak storm.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A family is praying for a miracle after 10-year-old Asher Sullivan was swept into a storm drain after a severe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxweather.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;weather event.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Sullivan said on Facebook that his son was playing outside while neighbors fixed their homes and cleaned debris after a storm tore through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Christiana, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, where, &quot;Somehow, Asher got caught in the storm drain and was swept under the neighborhood streets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He eventually came out in a drainage ditch and CPR was administered for quite some time,&quot; Jimmy Sullivan wrote on Facebook. &quot;His heart beat was reestablished, but the damage is substantial.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Sullivan, superintendent/director of schools with the Rutherford County School District, has been posting regular updates, and his family are holding on to the slightest glimpses of promise, but he said Sunday, &quot;recovery does not seem possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-mom-dies-saving-drowning-daughter-just-before-mothers-day-sheriff&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MOM DIES SAVING DROWNING DAUGHTER JUST BEFORE MOTHER&apos;S DAY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sullivan wrote on Friday that the doctor told his family Asher &quot;wouldn&apos;t survive his injuries,&quot; but neurology &quot;saw a few signs,&quot; such as a pain response in his arm and pupils reacting to light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later the same day, Sullivan said his son breathed on his own for the second time while on a ventilator. &quot;Only a few, but a win is a win.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Think we need to leave him alone for the night to rest,&quot; he wrote in a 6:30 p.m. post on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/americans-stranded-norwegian-cruise-save-elderly-passenger-family-says-ship-left-her-die&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;AMERICANS, INCLUDING SOUTH CAROLINA COUPLE, STRANDED BY  CRUISE SAVE ELDERLY PASSENGER, FAMILY SAYS: SHIP ‘LEFT HER TO DIE’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the faintest hint of hope dimmed even more. &quot;Neurological signs we were seeing as positives have stopped,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;(Asher) had some real tough moments with pulse, blood pressure and breathing,&quot; Sullivan wrote on Facebook Sunday shortly after 6 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same Sunday evening update, Sullivan posted a picture of his family holding hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/search-missing-south-carolina-cruise-passenger-complicated-jungle-terrain-family-demands-us-help&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;VOLUNTEERS&apos; SEARCH FOR MISSING DAD WHO DISAPPEARED DURING CRUISE EXCURSION COMPLICATED BY JUNGLE TERRAIN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unfortunately, the worst case scenarios seemed to have come true,&quot; the father wrote in a heartbreaking post. &quot;He’s not in imminent danger at this very moment, but recovery does not seem possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he and his wife Kaycee &quot;have some impossible decisions to make in the next few days that no parents should have to face. Please pray for our family and our sweet Asher.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nurses woke up Asher&apos;s parents to say he stopped breathing on his own, and his eyes were not responsive, according to a Monday Facebook post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/nurse-helping-americans-alleged-bahamas-attack-scared-what-she-saw-couldve-been-daughters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NURSE HELPING AMERICANS IN ALLEGED BAHAMAS ATTACK WAS ‘SCARED’ BY WHAT SHE SAW: ‘COULD’VE BEEN MY DAUGHTERS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday night was much the same, Sullivan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asher&apos;s tragic accident happened after his hometown in middle Tennessee was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/tornado&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;devastated by tornadoes&lt;/a&gt;, severe storms and floods on May 8 and 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Several waves of severe thunderstorms, including many supercells, impacted the midstate during this period,&quot; the National Weather Service said. &quot;All together, this event resulted in widespread wind damage across nearly every county of Middle Tennessee, large hail up to apple size and at least four tornadoes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 500 people gathered for a prayer vigil on Thursday, after news about Asher&apos;s tragic accident spread through the community, according to the school district. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school district posted over a dozen photos of community members and friends holding signs with Asher&apos;s picture saying, &quot;Prayers for Asher,&quot; on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They prayed, held each other and reflected, as they support the Sullivan family as strongly as Asher is fighting for his life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thank you to the 500-plus community members who attended Thursday&apos;s prayer vigil for RCS Director of Schools Dr. Jimmy Sullivan and his family as Asher Sullivan continues to fight for his life,&quot; the school district wrote in its Facebook post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Please keep the family and Asher&apos;s care team in your thoughts and prayers in the days ahead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>&apos;Gullible&apos; Biden admin lambasted by Sen. Cotton for &apos;de facto&apos; supporting Hamas victory over Israel</title>
                    
                    <description>Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., joined &amp;quot;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&amp;quot; Tuesday to discuss the United Nations putting out a report with false numbers of deaths in Gaza as the war in Israel is ongoing.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., joined &quot;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&quot; Tuesday to call out the &quot;gullible&quot; Biden administration and United Nations for believing false casualty figures out of Gaza. Cotton reacted to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-revises-gaza-death-toll-50-less-women-children-killed-previously-reported&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;new U.N. report&lt;/a&gt; that lowered the death toll for civilian casualties in Gaza by nearly half, explaining that Hamas has been exaggerating the death toll for months in the hope that the U.S. would pressure Israel to end the war. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/bidens-arms-embargo-israel-emboldens-hamas-missile-strikes-jewish-state&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN&apos;S ARMS EMBARGO ON ISRAEL &apos;EMBOLDENS&apos; HAMAS MISSILE STRIKES AGAINST JEWISH STATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOM COTTON: &lt;i&gt;The &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-revises-gaza-death-toll-50-less-women-children-killed-previously-reported&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;United Nations&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; has long been a notorious hotbed of hatred for Israel, and you can never trust the United Nations on matters related to Israel. Look, every civilian death is a tragedy in the eyes of Israelis and Americans. But for Hamas, every civilian death is a strategy. Hamas knows it can&apos;t beat Israel militarily. So they&apos;re trying to beat Israel politically by using civilians as human shields, hiding underneath them and behind them, trying to increase those death tolls, exaggerating them to a gullible United Nations and a gullible Joe Biden, who will then put political pressure on Israel to end this war. Joe Biden&apos;s position now is de facto for a Hamas victory against Israel, because if Hamas survives, Hamas wins. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a dramatic shift, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has revised its data pertaining to the number of Palestinian casualties in the seven-month-old Gaza war, reducing almost by half the number of women and children it previously said were killed in the hostilities between Israel and the Iranian-backed terror group Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to an infographic published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-day-213&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;OCHA’s daily report on May 6&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the number of women killed in the fighting was said to be 9,500, while the organization, which admits to relying on figures from the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza, claimed that 14,500 children had been killed since the war began on Oct. 7. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days later, in its May 8 report, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-day-215&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the U.N. agency appeared to have cut the number nearly in half&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, showing instead that some 4,959 women and 7,797 children had been killed so far in the war, which began after thousands of Hamas-led terrorists infiltrated southern Israel from Gaza, slaughtering more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 people hostage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked to explain the sudden change in their statistics, Farhan Aziz Haq, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, told Fox News Digital that the breakdowns were based on data from the Ministry of Health in Gaza, and that those figures &quot;can vary based on their own verification process that they undertake.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The United Nations teams on the ground in Gaza are unable to independently verify those figures given the prevailing situation on the ground and the sheer volume of fatalities,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;It is for this reason that all figures used by the U.N. clearly cite the Health Ministry in Gaza as the source.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Ruth Marks Eglash contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Washington governor&apos;s race loses two Bob Fergusons after Attorney General Bob Ferguson issues legal threats</title>
                    
                    <description>A conservative activist took credit for recruiting two men with the same name as Democratic frontrunner Bob Ferguson to enter Washington&amp;apos;s gubernatorial race.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson briefly had two unexpected challengers in the state&apos;s gubernatorial primary: Bob Ferguson and Bob Ferguson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by Monday evening, both of the lesser-known Bob Fergusons had withdrawn from the race, fearing prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The saga began on Friday when both rival Bobs entered the governor&apos;s race as Democrats, just before the filing deadline. They joined an already crowded field — 30 people filed to run for governor last week in Washington, according to the Secretary of State&apos;s website. The filing fee costs nearly $2,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/washington&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; has an open primary on Aug. 6. The top two candidates advance to the general election, regardless of their party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/west-coast-exodus-drives-surprising-political-effect-red-state-not-liberal-shift&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WEST COAST EXODUS DRIVES SURPRISING POLITICAL EFFECT IN RED STATE, AND IT&apos;S NOT A LIBERAL SHIFT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative activist Glen Morgan took credit for recruiting the same-named candidates and wrote on Facebook that the two Bobs are &quot;superior in every way to the AG running for the same office, and I believe they can provide better choices for the Democrats in our state for that office.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other Bobs are a retired state employee from Yakima and a military veteran from Graham, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/three-bob-night-two-more-bob-fergusons-running-for-wa-governor/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If I had started a little bit earlier, I would have been able to have six Bob Fergusons,&quot; Morgan said, according to the Times. &quot;I contacted about 12. I just ran out of time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferguson — the one who is currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/blue-state-high-capacity-magazine-ban-unconstitutional-judge-rules-law-remains-books-now&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;attorney general&lt;/a&gt; — was unamused, writing Saturday that the intent is clearly to &quot;confuse voters and diminish votes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a direct attack on our democracy and the integrity of the Washington state election system that could lead to the victory of an anti-choice conservative like Dave Reichert,&quot; he wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a press conference Monday, the attorney general warned that the other Bobs could face criminal charges if they didn&apos;t drop out of the race by the 5 p.m. withdrawal deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a felony under &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=29A.84.320&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Washington law&lt;/a&gt; for someone to file for office with a last name &quot;similar to one who has already filed for the same office, and whose political reputation is widely known, with intent to confuse and mislead the electors by capitalizing on the public reputation of the candidate who had previously filed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/seattle-area-officials-want-no-locks-no-cells-juvenile-offenders-amid-rise-teen-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEATTLE-AREA OFFICIALS WANT &apos;NO LOCKS, NO CELLS&apos; FOR JUVENILE OFFENDERS AMID RISE IN TEEN CRIME&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I suspect they did not know about the legal implications of their actions,&quot; Ferguson said, adding that cease-and-desist letters were left at the other Bobs homes on Sunday and that he hoped they would recognize the seriousness of the situation and drop out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they don&apos;t, the attorney general said, &quot;We will have no choice but to take more serious steps and ask local prosecutors to do the right thing and pursue further action.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Monday evening, both Bobs were out of the race. The Bob Ferguson from Graham &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neighborsforbobfergusonpac.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;shared a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying that he was withdrawing &quot;under duress.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was publicly labeled a ‘threat to democracy’ by another candidate and his supporters,&quot; he wrote. &quot;In a typical hypocritical fashion, this other candidate’s actions are the true threat to democracy. I believe this shows that the other candidate fears he has not effectively done enough to stand out, or that he thinks voters are not competent enough to think for themselves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Ferguson celebrated the win Monday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We defeated their dirty tricks,&quot; he wrote. &quot;You won’t have to worry about which ‘Bob Ferguson’ to vote for. This blatant attack on election integrity failed, and democracy wins.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/focus-merit-oregon-county-axes-diversity-office-cost-nearly-1-million-year&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘FOCUS ON MERIT’: OREGON COUNTY AXES DIVERSITY OFFICE THAT COST NEARLY $1 MILLION A YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the press conference, Ferguson did not specifically say whether Morgan himself could face charges for orchestrating the &quot;scheme.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will cross that bridge when we get to it,&quot; Ferguson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan did not address the possibility of civil or criminal penalties when asked for comment via email, but wrote that the attorney general &quot;has always been angry and upset&quot; with him for filing a campaign finance &lt;a href=&quot;https://crosscut.com/politics/2023/07/washington-governors-race-sparks-stricter-campaign-finance-rule&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;complaint against Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoever wins the governor&apos;s race will replace &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gov-jay-inslee-wont-seek-reelection-ending-speculation-unprecedented-4th-term&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Democrat Jay Inslee&lt;/a&gt;, who has led the state since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republican side of the race has been mired in drama as well. Last month, both leading candidates were initially disqualified from receiving the state&apos;s GOP endorsement, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theolympian.com/news/local/article287872330.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;The Olympian&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semi Bird, a former school board member, was disqualified for his failure to disclose a misdemeanor grand larceny charge from 1993. Dave Reichert, a former congressman and detective credited with nabbing the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/ted-bundy-green-river-killer-gary-ridgway-true-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Green River killer,&lt;/a&gt; was disqualified as a result of a &quot;disparity in the vetting of the governor candidates,&quot; the outlet reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delegates overruled the disqualification and 72% endorsed Bird, who has raised only $400,000 compared to Reichert&apos;s $2.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Trump allies join forces to hammer &apos;sham&apos; trial &apos;weaponized&apos; against 45th president: &apos;Political persecution&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Former President Trump&amp;apos;s allies, including Vivek Ramaswamy, joined him in court Tuesday, where they held a press conference outside railing against the &amp;quot;sham&amp;quot; trial.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Allies of former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;, including former 2024 presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy and Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, slammed the ongoing NY v. Trump trial as a &quot;sham&quot; promoted by Democrats ahead of the 2024 election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I learned a lot from being in there in person. It is one of the most depressing places I have been in my life. But it is fitting because the only thing more depressing than the environment of that courtroom is what&apos;s actually happening in there. It&apos;s straight out of a Kafka novel. The prosecution&apos;s main strategy appears to be to bore the jurors into submission. And if you look in that direction, sadly, it may appear to actually be working,&quot; Ramaswamy said Tuesday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;outside the New York courthouse,&lt;/a&gt; adding that the case is &quot;politicized persecution.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The whole case that Alvin Bragg has brought depends on one premise for them to charge this as a felony, is that Donald Trump somehow should have used campaign funds to make an allegedly personal payment. Yet if he had done that, their case against him would be even stronger. This is garbage.… It&apos;s damned if you do, damned if you don&apos;t. This is a sham. This is not the United States of America. This is some third-rate banana republic,&quot; Ramaswamy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida Rep. Cory Mills, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Ramaswamy, Donalds and House Speaker Mike Johnson joined Trump in court on Tuesday. A Trump campaign official told Fox News Digital that the supporters all volunteered to join Trump in court to support their friend, and were not invited by the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/may-14-trump-trial-new-york-michael-cohen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIVE UPDATES: MICHAEL COHEN TESTIMONY CONTINUES AFTER EX-LAWYER REVEALS SECRET RECORDINGS OF TRUMP IN NY TRIAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&apos;s nothing that has been wrong here. Nothing that has been done poorly by President Trump. The only thing that&apos;s being done wrong is by this judge. His daughter is making money, raising money for Democrats, and all of the fundraising emails, and all the fundraising things are about this trial that his daughter is using. He won&apos;t recuse himself. This is a travesty of justice. This is a misuse of the justice system,&quot; Donalds said during the press conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s legal team had previously demanded presiding Judge Juan Merchan&apos;s recusal from the case, citing that Merchan&apos;s daughter works as a Democratic consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trial-veepstakes-trump-allies-show-force-ahead-michael-cohens-second-day-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP TRIAL VEEPSTAKES? TRUMP ALLIES SHOW UP IN FORCE AHEAD OF MICHAEL COHEN&apos;S SECOND DAY OF TESTIMONY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mills slammed the trial as &quot;the weaponization of what was the Department of Justice,&quot; and Burgum called the case &quot;election interference&quot; that is &quot;tying up the president for being out on the campaign trail.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The allies joining Trump Tuesday follow fellow supporters such as Ohio Sen. JD Vance, New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, and Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville who attended Trump&apos;s trial on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump is in court for his 17th day of the trial on Tuesday. The case focuses on Cohen paying former pornographic performer Stormy Daniels $130,000 to allegedly quiet her claims of an alleged 2006 extramarital affair with the then-real estate tycoon. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege that the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen and fraudulently logged the payments as legal expenses. Prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified records with the intent to commit or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conceal a second crime&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/massive-trump-beach-rally-deep-blue-nj-draws-stark-contrast-bidens-beach-weekend-biden-could-never&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MASSIVE TRUMP BEACH RALLY IN DEEP-BLUE NJ DRAWS STARK CONTRAST TO BIDEN&apos;S BEACH WEEKEND: &apos;BIDEN COULD NEVER&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has pleaded not guilty in the case and has maintained his innocence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week began with testimony from Cohen, who is considered the prosecution&apos;s star witness in the case. The former Trump attorney detailed to the court that he spent his own funds to pay Daniels $130,000 in order to execute a non-disclosure agreement and obtain rights to her claims of an affair. In October 2016, according to Cohen&apos;s testimony, he told Trump that Daniels must be paid in order to quiet her claims &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ahead of Election Day the following month&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cohen&apos;s testimony also included&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; how he secretly recorded Trump in 2016 regarding another payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal. McDougal also claimed she had an affair with Trump in 2006, which the 45th president has repeatedly denied. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker purchased exclusive rights to her story to bury the claims ahead of the 2016 election, according to trial testimony. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-highly-conflicted-judge-after-first-day-michael-cohens-testimony-wraps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP BLASTS &apos;HIGHLY CONFLICTED&apos; JUDGE AFTER MICHAEL COHEN&apos;S FIRST DAY OF TESTIMONY WRAPS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Cohen&apos;s testimony comes&lt;/a&gt; after Daniels took the stand last week, and detailed to the court that she met Trump in 2006 at Lake Tahoe in Nevada during a celebrity golf tournament. She alleged that the pair had sex in Trump&apos;s hotel room during the event, which Trump has repeatedly denied in public comments. Daniels&apos; testimony also included describing to the court how she got into the pornography business after working as an exotic dancer as a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal experts subsequently sounded off that Daniels’ testimony was irrelevant to the case and that it should not have been admitted into the record. Trump&apos;s legal team twice moved for a mistrial, but was denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michael-cohen-testifies-he-secretly-recorded-trump-lead-up-2016-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL COHEN TESTIFIES HE SECRETLY RECORDED TRUMP IN LEAD-UP TO 2016 ELECTION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burgum added during the Tuesday press conference that while the trial continues, allies of Trump&apos;s will continue campaigning for the 45th president as Americans deal with spiraling inflation under the Biden administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re all here today because of the circus of this trial. But I want to say a word to those Americans out there that are dealing with Biden&apos;s inflation. And when their paychecks aren&apos;t helping them get through the end of the month because they&apos;re paying more for their gas and their food. They&apos;re paying more for their electricity. I want them to know that while this trial is going on, there&apos;s many of us around the country that are out helping campaign for President Trump to make sure that the message gets through,&quot; Burgum said in closing remarks. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For over a year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kevin-costner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kevin Costner&lt;/a&gt; has been at the center of controversy when it comes to the future of &quot;Yellowstone.&quot; Now, the actor is sharing the &quot;real truth&quot; about the behind-the-scenes drama and what led to the show&apos;s delay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new interview &lt;a href=&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/05/kevin-costner-horizon-an-american-saga-yellowstone-controversy-1235907679/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;with Deadline&lt;/a&gt;, the 69-year-old actor, who portrays John Dutton lll in the series, says he &quot;lived up&quot; to his contract despite ongoing speculation and opened up about the series of events that led to the show&apos;s demise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was no script,&quot; Costner, who has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kevin-costners-yellowstone-co-star-luke-grimes-speaks-out-stars-unfortunate-exit-hit-show&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;yet to film&lt;/a&gt; the second half of season 5 (5B), revealed. &quot;And then things imploded. You’ve been reading one version [of the show&apos;s issues] for a year and a half.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the first half of the fifth season aired late last year, the show took a break for the holidays. They were set to return to filming at the top of the new year, but that was pushed back to sometime this summer. A premiere date has not been announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/yellowstone-ending-after-second-half-season-five-amid-kevin-costner-drama&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&apos;YELLOWSTONE&apos; ENDING AFTER SECOND HALF OF SEASON FIVE AMID KEVIN COSTNER DRAMA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple sources kept alleging that Costner only wanted to work for one week to film the rest of the episodes, which would be difficult to do as he is the star of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I left my movie [&quot;Horizon&quot;] to be on time for them for 5B,&quot; Costner said. &quot;I left exactly when they wanted, and it made it hard on me. It turns out they didn’t have the scripts for 5B. They needed four more days just to complete the first eight episodes. I left early to give them what they needed to have a complete eight, and I felt bad that the audience didn’t get 10. They didn’t have the scripts for anything else.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, &quot;So, what you read in the end was that I said, ‘Well, look, I’m doing my movie. If you want me to work a week because you want to kill me or whatever else, I can give you a week.’ I really didn’t have that week to give them, but I said, I’ll do that. And then they [spun that] into, I only wanted to work a week.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you think that’s who I am?,&quot; he continued. &quot;I’ve never missed a day of work. I’ve never left before fulfilling my contractual obligations. A lot of times, I stay as much as I can.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for Costner did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital&apos;s request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costner, who has faced plenty of criticism over the future of the show, admitted he was &quot;bothered&quot; by the production&apos;s lack of support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They were silent and that bothered me in the world of how you do things,&quot; he confessed. &quot;Why don’t you stick up for me? I went and sold this thing for you. I was going to only do one season. I made it for three. I fulfilled three. So, I went from one to three, then I did a fourth one for them, and they wanted to do three more. So, I made the contract to do that. They imploded. I had a contract to do five, six and seven. I was contracted to do that. There’s nothing I could have done to get out of that, nor was I trying to just figure out how, when we started.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[Production] didn’t have the scripts. And they wrote these other three shows,&quot; he added, referencing the various &quot;Yellowstone&quot; spinoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They don’t ever talk about that. And all they did was remember we were releasing the series in June, then it moved to October. They covered by changing their release pattern. That time was about a 14-month period. I said, ‘I can’t ever go through that again, where you shut down for over a year and I don’t have something in line to do.’ All I did was protect myself, but I didn’t put myself in first position, over ‘Yellowstone.’ I filled the gaps. Do you see that?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the ongoing drama, Costner - whose four-part post-Civil War drama &quot;Horizon&quot; premiered at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/cannes-film-festival&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cannes Film Festival&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in May - said he is &quot;open&quot; to coming back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m very open to coming back. If they’ve got so many other things going on, maybe this circles back and it’s a really cool two seasons,&quot; he said. &quot;Or end it, if the writing’s there and I’m happy with it. I’m open to that. But I took a beating over these guys not speaking up for me and allowing crazy stories to come out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m not happy about that,&quot; he admitted. &quot;But if the writing is there, I will be there too. They had first position. I didn’t do &apos;Horizon&apos; because I was tired of doing ‘Yellowstone.’ That’s a bulls--- story. I didn’t do ‘Horizon’ to compete with ‘Yellowstone.’ This is something I’ve had a long time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etonline.com/kevin-costner-discusses-son-hayes-acting-debut-in-horizon-and-final-season-of-yellowstone-exclusive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;interview with Entertainment Tonight&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at CinemaCon in April, Costner said he has already envisioned how his character&apos;s story line will end — but is not sure creator Taylor Sheridan will go in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, you know, he needs to be proactive in what happens,&quot; Costner told ET of his character. &quot;And I&apos;ve kind of had my own fantasy how it might be, but that&apos;s Taylor&apos;s thing. I said as much to him, you know, a while back. Maybe he doesn&apos;t remember. I had thoughts how it could happen, but we just have to see.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think that they should do whatever they want to do,&quot; he told Deadline. &quot;Am I open to coming back? I’ve never been in a position to tell them what to do. I can only do what I can do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Emily Trainham contributed to this post. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Georgia Instacart driver says she attempted food delivery to prison for &apos;death row inmate feast&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>An Instacart driver in Georgia took to TikTok after failing to deliver wings to a state prison. The request on the app said the delivery was for a &amp;quot;death row inmate feast.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A delivery driver is attracting attention online after she claimed in a TikTok video that a food order she picked up was requested to be delivered to a prison for a death row inmate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrishalea Farley, 39, a part-time Instacart driver from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/georgia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;McDonough, Georgia,&lt;/a&gt; told Fox News Digital that she received a request for a large wing platter and potato wedges from a local Publix to be picked up and delivered to a location nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without thinking much about it, Farley said, she took the order and headed to the recipient&apos;s address. She then realized she was driving to Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison in Jackson, where male death row inmates are housed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/steak-jelly-please-americans-tell-uber-eats-odd-popular-customer-requests-2023&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘STEAK AND JELLY, PLEASE,’ AMERICANS TELL UBER EATS — AND OTHER ODD AND POPULAR CUSTOMER REQUESTS OF 2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was directed to &quot;See chaplain Miller for death row inmate…&quot; – according to the Instacart order notes that showed on her app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My initial reaction after reading the delivery information [was] I thought I was actually delivering a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/odd-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;last meal to an inmate,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Farley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farley said that when she arrived at the prison, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a correctional officer&lt;/a&gt; asked her to pull her car forward so that her delivery attempt could be reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/accomplished-drivers-spotlighted-uber-first-ever-yearbook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MOST ACCOMPLISHED DRIVERS SPOTLIGHTED BY UBER IN FIRST-EVER ‘YEARBOOK’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I read it off and gave them the name, and I told them the person that they told me to contact, which was Chaplain Miller,&quot; Farley told Fox News Digital in a statement sent via text message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/man-goes-viral-taste-testing-last-meals-notorious-death-row-inmates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAN GOES VIRAL FOR TASTE-TESTING LAST MEALS OF NOTORIOUS DEATH ROW INMATES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Once they [saw] it, they just told me that they [couldn’t] receive that particular order,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farley said she was advised to give the food away or donate it, since officers would not accept the order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The wings were kept, and me and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/family-and-friends&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;my kids&lt;/a&gt; enjoyed a nice meal that evening,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farley recorded herself explaining the incident and posted the video onto TikTok, where it garnered more than 590,000 views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The food order totaled $15.66 and Farley received a tip of $3.23, according to screenshots of Farley&apos;s shopper &quot;batch summary,&quot; which she shared with Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dropoff occurred on April 10 at 1:13 p.m., and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the distance&lt;/a&gt; from Publix to the prison was 38.4 miles, another screenshot of the order showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to Instacart for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farley said the bizarre moment ignited a mix of emotions – from her thinking that she was delivering someone’s final meal, to confusion about whether an inmate had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ordered food&lt;/a&gt; himself through Instacart from a mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Never am I laughing at the [inmate&apos;s] situation, as I wish that on no one, but the humor of it all just kept me laughing,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Trump flanked by strong showing of GOP allies amid Cohen&apos;s testimony in NY v. Trump trial: PHOTOS</title>
                    
                    <description>House Speaker Mike Johnson and Ohio Sen. JD Vance are among the bevy of Republican lawmakers and politicians joining President Trump amid the NY v. Trump trial.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A bevy of Republican allies are joining &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;former President Trump&lt;/a&gt; in Manhattan court this week, including a handful of politicians floated as potential vice presidential contenders in Trump&apos;s effort to re-win the White House this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump was flanked Tuesday ahead of court by House Speaker Mike Johnson, Florida Reps. Byron Donalds and Cory Mills, as well as North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former 2024 presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson held a press conference Tuesday morning outside the courthouse, where he railed against presiding Judge Juan Merchan and the prosecution team as politically-motivated against Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What we&apos;ve got here is a partisan Democrat district attorney. We have a Biden donor judge, and we have an assistant D.A. who was recently a top official at the Department of Justice, Biden&apos;s DOJ, and recently received over $10,000 in payments from the Democratic National Committee,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/may-14-trump-trial-new-york-michael-cohen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIVE UPDATES: MICHAEL COHEN TESTIMONY TO CONTINUE AFTER EX-LAWYER REVEALS SECRET RECORDINGS OF TRUMP IN NY TRIAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The judicial system in our country has been weaponized against President Trump. The system is using all the tools at its disposal right now to punish one president and provide cover for another. And meanwhile, among the atrocities here, the judge&apos;s own daughter is making millions of dollars doing online fundraising for Democrat,&quot; he continued, citing Merchan&apos;s daughter&apos;s work as a political consultant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the former president was joined by Ohio Sen. JD Vance, New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, and his son Eric Trump. Eric Trump is also in court with his father again Tuesday, as is Trump attorney Alina Habba. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trial-veepstakes-trump-allies-show-force-ahead-michael-cohens-second-day-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP TRIAL VEEPSTAKES? TRUMP ALLIES SHOW UP IN FORCE AHEAD OF MICHAEL COHEN&apos;S SECOND DAY OF TESTIMONY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians and lawmakers such as Vance, Donalds, Burgum and Ramaswamy have all been floated as potential picks for vice president on Trump&apos;s ticket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Trump campaign official told Fox News Digital that the supporters all volunteered to join Trump in court to support their friend, and were not invited by the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump is back in court Tuesday for his 17th day of the trial, where the court is hearing testimony again from former Trump attorney Michael Cohen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/massive-trump-beach-rally-deep-blue-nj-draws-stark-contrast-bidens-beach-weekend-biden-could-never&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MASSIVE TRUMP BEACH RALLY IN DEEP-BLUE NJ DRAWS STARK CONTRAST TO BIDEN&apos;S BEACH WEEKEND: &apos;BIDEN COULD NEVER&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;action-packed day in court&lt;/a&gt;, hearing testimony for the first time from former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen. The case focuses on Cohen paying former pornographic actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to allegedly quiet her claims of an alleged extramarital affair with the then-real estate tycoon in 2006. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-allies-pour-into-nyc-courthouse-support-their-friend-not-coordinating-campaign&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP ALLIES POUR INTO NYC COURTHOUSE TO &apos;SUPPORT THEIR FRIEND,&apos; SAY THEY&apos;RE NOT COORDINATING WITH CAMPAIGN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege that the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen and fraudulently logged the payments as legal expenses. Prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified records with the intent to commit or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conceal a second crime&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen testified to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;secretly recording&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Trump in September 2016 to share with publisher David Pecker proof that Trump planned to reimburse Pecker for purchasing the potentially damaging story, according to the testimony. Cohen added that in addition to easing Pecker&apos;s mind that he would be repaid, he also made the recording in order to keep Pecker &quot;loyal&quot; to Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-highly-conflicted-judge-after-first-day-michael-cohens-testimony-wraps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP BLASTS &apos;HIGHLY CONFLICTED&apos; JUDGE AFTER MICHAEL COHEN&apos;S FIRST DAY OF TESTIMONY WRAPS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also detailed to the court that he spent his own funds to pay Daniels $130,000 in order to execute a non-disclosure agreement and obtain rights to her claims of the affair. In October 2016, according to Cohen&apos;s testimony, he told Trump that Daniels must be paid in order to quiet her claims &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ahead of Election Day the following month&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He testified that he spoke with Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg about how to fund the payment, with Weisselberg saying he was not in a position to initially foot the bill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michael-cohen-testifies-he-secretly-recorded-trump-lead-up-2016-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL COHEN TESTIFIES HE SECRETLY RECORDED TRUMP IN LEAD-UP TO 2016 ELECTION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-defenders-show-up-force-ahead-cohen-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP, DEFENDERS SHOW UP IN FORCE AHEAD OF COHEN TESTIMONY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen said he did not discuss the matter with his wife, and decided to gather funds through a home equity line of credit instead of drawing the money from his personal account. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The star witness here is Michael Cohen. I just listened to a few moments of his, testimony this morning, and it is consistent with what he&apos;s already done. This is a man who is clearly on a mission for personal revenge, and who is widely known as a witness who has trouble with the truth. He is someone who has a history of perjury and is well known for it. No one should believe a word he says today. He lied to Congress. He lied to the IRS. He lied to federal election officials. Even Cohen&apos;s own lawyer testified to a grand jury that he is not reliable. So there&apos;s nothing that he presents here that should be given any weight at all by a jury, and certainly not this judge,&quot; Speaker Johnson said in his remarks Monday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;outside the Manhattan courthouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>First AI talks begin between Chinese and US envoys</title>
                    
                    <description>China and the United States held their first meeting on the topic of artificial intelligence on May 14, 2024, a historic step for governance of emerging AI technology.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Top envoys from the U.S. and China huddled in closed-door talks in Geneva on Tuesday to lay out their national approaches to the promise and perils of emerging artificial intelligence technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talks, which Presidents Joe Biden and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/xi-jinping&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Xi Jinping&lt;/a&gt; agreed to launch in last 2023, are meant to open up bilateral dialogue between the world’s two biggest economies — and increasingly, geopolitical rivals — on a fast-moving technology that already has consequences for trade, lifestyles, culture, politics, national security and defense and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. technology experts say the meeting — led on the American side by high-level White House and State Department officials — could offer a glimpse into Beijing’s thinking about AI amid a generally tight-lipped Chinese approach to the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/state-department-wants-china-russia-declare-ai-wont-control-nuclear-weapons-only-humans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STATE DEPARTMENT WANTS CHINA, RUSSIA TO DECLARE THAT AI WON&apos;T CONTROL NUCLEAR WEAPONS, ONLY HUMANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-founder Jason Glassberg of Casaba Security in Redmond, Washington, an expert on new and emerging &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/artificial-intelligence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;threats posed by AI&lt;/a&gt;, handicapped the meeting as a get-to-know-you that will likely yield few concrete results, but get the two sides talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What’s most important right now is that both sides realize they each have a lot to lose if AI becomes weaponized or abused,&quot; Glassberg said in an e-mail. &quot;All parties involved are equally at risk. Right now, one of the biggest areas of risk is with deepfakes, particularly for use in disinformation campaigns.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is just as big of a risk for the PRC as it is for the U.S. government,&quot; he added, referring to the People’s Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear why the meeting was taking place in Geneva, though the internationally-minded Swiss city bills itself as a hub of diplomacy and U.N. and international institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Geneva-based International Telecommunications Union — a U.N. agency currently headed by American Doreen Bodgan-Martin and previously run by China’s Houlin Zhao — is set to host its annual &quot;AI for Good&quot; conference in the city later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting is the first under an intergovernmental dialogue on AI agreed upon during a multi-faceted meeting between Xi and Biden in San Francisco six months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has sought to set some guardrails around the technology while fostering its growth, seeking a possible boon for economic output and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western experts have suggested that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;China’s government&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, has in part kept a lid on AI applications because of its real or potential applications for military and surveillance activities under the ruling Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials suggested they would lay out ways to mitigate possible risks from the technology by creating voluntary commitments with the sector’s leading companies and requiring safety tests of AI products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>2 men held without bail after allegedly plotting ISIS-inspired attack against Jews in England</title>
                    
                    <description>Two men appeared in a London court on Tuesday and were held without bail on charges of planning an ISIS-inspired attack to kill Jews in northwest England.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two men accused of plotting to gun down Jews in an Islamic State-inspired attack in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;northwest England&lt;/a&gt; were held without bail Tuesday after appearing in a London court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walid Saadaoui, 36, and Amar Hussein, 50, were accused of planning to use automatic weapons to kill Jews, police and military personnel, prosecutors said in Westminster Magistrates’ Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The duo face charges of preparing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;terrorist acts&lt;/a&gt; between Dec. 13 and last Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/warsaw-synagogue-attacked-night-3-firebombs-no-injuries-reported&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARSAW SYNAGOGUE ATTACKED AT NIGHT WITH 3 FIREBOMBS, NO INJURIES REPORTED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charges come as incidents of antisemitism in the U.K. hit a record high last year — with a spike following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel and Israel’s ensuing military campaign in Gaza, according to Community Security Trust, an advocacy group for British Jews that works to eliminate antisemitism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is one of a number of recent and ongoing cases that demonstrate why the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/judaism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jewish community&lt;/a&gt; needs such extensive security measures,&quot; said Amanda Bomsztyk, northern regional director of the trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third man, Bilel Saadaoui, 35, was accused of making arrangements for the expected death of his brother, co-defendant Walid Saadaoui.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pleaded not guilty to a charge of failing to disclose information about an act of terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defense lawyer Angelo Saponiere said Bilel Saadaoui was a family man unaware of the alleged plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three were arrested last week by Greater Manchester Police. They were held without bail and scheduled to appear May 24 for a hearing in the Central Criminal Court.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Israel releases new Gaza civilian death toll, says Hamas’ numbers are ‘fake and fabricated’</title>
                    
                    <description>Israel for the first time has released its estimate of how many civilians it believes have died during fighting against Hamas inside the Gaza Strip.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Israel for the first time&lt;/a&gt; has released its estimated civilian death toll in Gaza, saying that 16,000 have been killed in the war that began on Oct. 7 instead of the approximately 35,000 that the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas&apos; Ministry of Health is claiming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel government spokesperson Avi Hyman tells Fox News that for 221 days, his country has been &quot;condemned globally because of a fake and fabricated civilian death toll created and disseminated by Hamas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The United Nations has rubber-stamped these Hamas numbers and become a Hamas newswire to the world,&quot; he said. &quot;In reality, Israel is setting the new gold standard for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;urban warfare&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with what appears to be the lowest civilian to combatant casualty ratios in history.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Hyman, citing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a video that &quot;we believe we have killed in excess of 14,000 terrorists and sadly around 16,000 civilians&quot; inside the Gaza Strip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/turkeys-erdogan-defends-hamas-claims-1000-members-countrys-hospitals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TURKEY’S ERDOGAN DEFENDS HAMAS, CLAIMS MORE THAN 1,000 MEMBERS ARE AT HIS COUNTRY’S HOSPITALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We would expect everyone to now take these figures as a genuine estimate from a free democratic country that fights in strict accordance with the laws of armed conflict in one of the most challenging urban warfare scenarios in history,&quot; he added. &quot;Let me make it clear, every civilian casualty is a tragedy. That would not have happened if Hamas hadn’t insisted on using their own people as human shields.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyman also said the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;figures coming from Hamas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &quot;spits in the face of our brave heroes who have paid the ultimate price to fight this just and moral war.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-walks-tightrope-israel-contradictory-messaging&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHITE HOUSE WALKS DIPLOMATIC TIGHTROPE ON ISRAEL WITH CONTRADICTORY MESSAGING&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Israeli Defense Forces’ own losses in the conflict have risen to 620, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel’s new estimates come after the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs revised its data pertaining to the number of women and children who have died in the war. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the World Health Organization on Tuesday said there is &quot;nothing wrong&quot; with the numbers being provided by the Hamas-led Gaza Ministry of Health, according to Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Dolton board makes new move against scandal-ridden &apos;supermayor&apos; Tiffany Henyard</title>
                    
                    <description>Dolton board members have appointed a mayor pro tempore to serve in place of controversial Mayor Tiffany Henyard should she not to execute her duties</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There has been another twist in the ongoing saga in the small &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/chicago&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chicago town&lt;/a&gt; of Dolton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board members of Dolton appointed a mayor pro tempore on Monday to serve in place of embattled Mayor Tiffany Henyard should she refuse to execute her duties, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/dolton-mayor-pro-tem-tiffany-henyard-investigation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox 32 Chicago&lt;/a&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trustee Jason House was voted in as mayor pro tempore – meaning for the time being – at a special meeting and could sign off on village business and pay bills in Henyard&apos;s absence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henyard, the self-described &quot;supermayor&quot; of Dolton, and Thornton Township Supervisor, has faced accusations of corruption and has drawn national attention to the small town which has a population of around 21,500. Dolton residents have called for Henyard&apos;s resignation, including booing her at the last Village Board meeting she attended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/controversial-democrat-mayor-henyard-investigation-wild-tirades-police-raids-lavish-spending&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEMOCRATIC ILLINOIS ‘SUPER MAYOR’ VETOES ATTEMPT TO PROBE HER LAVISH SPENDING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board says Henyard is ignoring important village business and that their move was necessary so that Dolton can function and residents can receive services. They say she has missed 25 of the special meetings and refuses to allow some business to be put on the agenda for the village’s regular meetings, WGN reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’re just really trying to make sure that if something critical comes up, that there’s a signature on deck that can move it forward,&quot; House said, according to the media outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is not a replacement. This ordinance is strictly in the refusal or inability for the mayor to do her duties, an appointed senior trustee to step in and make sure the necessary documents are signed and business moves forward,&quot; House said during Monday night&apos;s trustee meeting, Fox 32 reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to one report, Henyard is expected to veto the action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has already vetoed the board&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrat-super-mayor-vetoes-attempt-probe-lavish-spending&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;request to launch a federal investigation&lt;/a&gt; into her alleged misuse of funds and last week vetoed their hiring of former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who had been tasked with leading a special investigation into the mayor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lightfoot was being paid $400 an hour to gather information on Henyard’s alleged spending and finance mismanagement, but Henyard said she would not be paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henyard has been dubbed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/watch-chaos-erupts-town-hall-meeting-citizens-bang-doors-condemn-worst-mayor-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;worst mayor in America&quot;&lt;/a&gt; by critics after being accused of misdeeds ranging from weaponizing police raids to spending taxpayer money on luxuries in Las Vegas. Most recently, the scandal-ridden mayor has also come under fire for an alleged sexual assault by one of her allies during the Vegas trip, where the alleged victim claims to have been fired after speaking out. Henyard’s cancer charity is also facing scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/controversial-mayor-posts-video-biden-days-ripping-colleagues-attacking-black-woman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONTROVERSIAL MAYOR POSTS VIDEO WITH BIDEN JUST DAYS AFTER RIPPING COLLEAGUES FOR &apos;ATTACKING ON A BLACK WOMAN&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month the FBI served two federal subpoenas as part of an investigation. Henyard herself was not served.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first one was for employment records, personnel files, and disciplinary reports for 25 Dolton employees, including three police officers and Keith Freeman, who is the village administrator and Henyard&apos;s top aide. Freeman was charged with bankruptcy fraud on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second subpoena was served specifically on Freeman, asking for records of all companies associated with him and possible ties to the village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, it was reported that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/fbi-reportedly-investigating-controversial-democratic-mayor-schmoozed-biden-last-month&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;FBI was investigating&lt;/a&gt; the mayor, as six individuals had reportedly spoken to the agency about her alleged misconduct, including &quot;business owners, a former village employee and one or more public officials.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital requested comment from Henyard’s office but did not immediately receive a response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henyard has appealed to racial politics amid her scandals before, proclaiming during a previous meeting, &quot;Y’all got false narratives out there, and y’all should be ashamed of y’all selves. Y’all Black. Y’all are Black! And y’all sitting up here beating and attacking on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/controversial-mayor-launches-wild-tirade-officials-attacking-black-woman-power-spending&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Black woman that’s in power.&lt;/a&gt; Y’all should be ashamed of y’all selves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital previously reported that Henyard has been living like a royal with a combined salary of nearly $300,000 — more than the state&apos;s governor — and frequent use of beauty vendors, despite the 23,000 residents of the Illinois town having a median income of $24,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor, who insists &quot;God chose me&quot; and met with President Biden in January, has been said to engage in such wild antics it is like a &quot;real life Parks and Rec situation.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Alexander Hall and Bradford Betz contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>The White House is protesting a bill put forth by House Republicans that would compel President Biden to cease withholding shipments of military aid to Israel.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The White House is speaking out against a Republican-led bill that would force &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt; to stop withholding military shipments to Israel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans in the House of Representatives introduced the Israel Security Assistance Support Act over the weekend, which would &quot;[compel] the expeditious delivery of approved defense articles and services to Israel, including third-party deliveries.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-denies-secret-plot-oust-karine-jean-pierre-biden-bad-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre&lt;/a&gt; spoke out against the bill at her Monday press conference, claiming it put restraints on the president&apos;s ability to fulfill foreign policy objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-says-biden-has-strengthened-hamas-withholding-aid-from-israel-completely-incompetent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPUBLICAN SAYS BIDEN HAS &apos;STRENGTHENED&apos; HAMAS BY WITHHOLDING AID FROM ISRAEL: &apos;COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We strongly, strongly oppose attempts to constrain the president’s ability to deploy U.S. security assistance consistent with U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives,&quot; said Jean-Pierre at the Monday press briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden has so far withheld one shipment of weapons covered by the Israeli aid package passed in Congress last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jean-Pirre told reporters at the press conference that the Biden administration intends to eventually follow through with all $17 billion of aid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;approved by Congress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-under-investigation-after-threat-israels-offensive-aid-playing-political-games&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN UNDER INVESTIGATION AFTER THREAT TO ISRAEL&apos;S OFFENSIVE AID: &apos;PLAYING POLITICAL GAMES&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is our objective, as well, that we plan to spend every last cent appropriated consistent with legal obligations, including in the recent […] national security supplemental that was just passed,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;White House&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; unclear intentions regarding fulfilling the Israeli aid package has threatened to rupture the Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/democratic-party&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Twenty-six Democrats&lt;/a&gt; signed a letter to the president last week expressing concern about &quot;the message the Administration is sending to Hamas and other Iranian-backed terrorist proxies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After President Biden gave his ultimatum of withholding offensive weapons to the Jewish state if Israel were to launch an invasion of Rafah, rocket attacks rained down on Israel on Friday from Rafah, with more rockets fired on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamas launched rockets from Rafah at the southern &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Israeli city&lt;/a&gt; of Beersheva on Friday for the first time since December, as Iranian proxy Hezbollah sent a barrage of rockets into the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona, causing a massive fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Benjamin Weinthal contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>NY v. Trump: Appeals court rejects Trump&apos;s request to end &apos;unconstitutional&apos; gag order</title>
                    
                    <description>The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court rejected former President Trump&amp;apos;s request to end the gag order imposed on him amid the NY v. Trump case.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Donald Trump&apos;s attempt&lt;/a&gt; to end a gag order that has prevented him from speaking publicly about many aspects of the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We find that Justice Merchan properly weighed petitioner’s First Amendment Rights against the court’s historical commitment to ensuring the fair administration of justice in criminal cases, and the right of persons related or tangentially related to the criminal proceedings from being free from threats, intimidation, harassment, and harm,&quot; the First Department of the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division wrote in its order Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s legal team now has the opportunity to appeal the gag order to the New York Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The gag order imposed by conflicted Judge Juan Merchan in the lawless Manhattan DA case is unconstitutional and un-American. The threat to throw the 45th President of the United States and the leading candidate in the 2024 presidential election in jail for exercising his First Amendment rights is a Third World authoritarian tactic typical of Crooked Joe Biden and his comrades,&quot; Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/may-14-trump-trial-new-york-michael-cohen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL COHEN TESTIMONY TO CONTINUE AFTER EX-LAWYER REVEALS SECRET RECORDINGS OF TRUMP IN NY TRIAL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rejected appeal comes as Trump, as well as his allies, have repeatedly and consistently railed against the order as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;unconstitutional&quot; and preventing Trump&lt;/a&gt; from defending himself from critics&apos; attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presiding Judge Juan Merchan imposed the gag order on Trump before his criminal trial in New York began, ordering the presumptive Republican presidential nominee not to make or direct others to make public statements about witnesses, counsel in the case or about court staff, the DA staff or family members of staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trial-veepstakes-trump-allies-show-force-ahead-michael-cohens-second-day-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP TRIAL VEEPSTAKES? TRUMP ALLIES SHOW UP IN FORCE AHEAD OF MICHAEL COHEN&apos;S SECOND DAY OF TESTIMONY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the trial kicked off, Merchan ruled that Trump violated the order on 10 occasions, resulting in a combined $10,000 fine. The violations stemmed from messages posted by Trump on Truth Social and the campaign&apos;s website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the judge’s initial gag order ruling, he threatened Trump with jail time if he further violated the order, while also lamenting not being able to fine Trump more than $1,000 for each violation. Merchan wrote in the order that if Trump carries out &quot;continued willful violations&quot; of the gag order, he could face &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&quot;incarceratory punishment&quot;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if &quot;necessary and appropriate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/massive-trump-beach-rally-deep-blue-nj-draws-stark-contrast-bidens-beach-weekend-biden-could-never&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MASSIVE TRUMP BEACH RALLY IN DEEP-BLUE NJ DRAWS STARK CONTRAST TO BIDEN&apos;S BEACH WEEKEND: &apos;BIDEN COULD NEVER&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merchan also lamented that the dollar amount of the penalties &quot;unfortunately will not achieve the desired result in those instances where the contemnor can easily afford such a fine.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michael-cohen-testifies-he-secretly-recorded-trump-lead-up-2016-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL COHEN TESTIFIES HE SECRETLY RECORDED TRUMP IN LEAD-UP TO 2016 ELECTION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump responded to the threats of jail earlier this month as a &quot;sacrifice&quot; he was willing to make to protect the Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have to watch every word I tell you people. You ask me a question, a simple question I&apos;d like to give it, but I can&apos;t talk about it because this judge has given me a gag order and [says] you&apos;ll go to jail if you violate it,&quot; Trump said last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And frankly, you know what? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/constitution&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Our Constitution is much more important&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than jail. It&apos;s not even close. I&apos;ll do that sacrifice any day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Scottie Scheffler and his wife Meredith announced the birth of their first child on Instagram Monday, just ahead of the PGA Championship this weekend.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/scottie-schefflers-torrid-run-continues-winning-rbc-heritage-one-week-masters-victory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scottie Scheffler&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was met with congratulations as he arrived at the Valhalla Golf Club on Monday after he picked up yet another title last week: dad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 10-time &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/golf/pga-tour&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;PGA Tour&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; winner took to social media on Monday to announce the birth of his first child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Welcome to the world little one. Your mom &amp;amp; dad love you so much,&quot; Scheffler said in a post on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheffler had been on a three-week break as he and his wife, Meredith, awaited the arrival of their child. They welcomed baby Bennett on May 8, according to The Associated Press. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I had, I think, pretty high expectations of what it would feel like, and I think those were far exceeded,&quot; Scheffler told Golf Channel’s Todd Lewis on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was fairly challenging leaving the house this morning, but I’m here. I’m committed to playing this week. I’m excited to be out here competing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/rory-mcilroy-denies-rift-tiger-woods-admits-differing-views-future-golf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;RORY MCILROY DENIES RIFT WITH TIGER WOODS BUT ADMITS TO DIFFERING VIEWS ON THE FUTURE OF GOLF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I told my little man when I was leaving, ‘I don&apos;t’ wanna leave, but I gotta leave,’&quot; Scheffler continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m called to come out here and do things to the best of my ability and so showing up this week, especially with the weather forecast the next couple of days, I know I had to be here to get some practice in to just see what’s going to happen the next few days.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheffler is looking to continue his hot streak, despite the extra time off. He has not played since winning the RBC Heritage, which came a week after he won his second &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/golf/the-masters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Masters green jacket.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheffler, who finished T2 at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/golf/pga-championship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;PGA Championship&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year, is coming off a streak of winning four of his last five tournaments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think as the week goes on I’ll get more and more immersed in what I’m doing and just trying to do my best to stay as present as I can on the golf course and then when I get home, I’ll be calling home as much as possible.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>&apos;Country is in crisis&apos;: House GOP unleashes on Dems with blistering ad marking 6 months until Election Day</title>
                    
                    <description>A new ad from the NRCC calls out House Democrats for &amp;quot;extremism&amp;quot; within their party, placing the blame on them for the &amp;quot;crisis&amp;quot; Republicans say currently faces the country.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST ON FOX: &lt;/strong&gt;The National Republican Congressional Committee unveiled an ad Tuesday morning signaling the six-month mark until the November election and accusing House Democrats of failing on a variety of top issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Under extreme House Democrats, the country is in crisis,&quot; the new ad &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS2UGxj8TYc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;released on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; starts out. &quot;The border is a disaster. The economy is failing. And lawlessness is the new normal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ad continues, &quot;Yet amid Democrats’ extremism, Republicans fight for our freedoms. We are six months out from the most important election of this lifetime. Fight for freedom. Fight for America. And vote on Nov. 5.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NRCC rapid response director Macy Gardner told Fox News Digital in a statement that &quot;extreme Democrats will plunge our country into an unprecedented level of chaos if we don’t kick them out of office in November.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-hopes-flipping-senate-democrats-major-roadblock-biden-swing-state-trouble-polls&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN FACING UPHILL BATTLE IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES AS DOWN-BALLOT DEMS LEAD: POLL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fortunately, House Republicans continue to fight tooth and nail to halt Biden’s border, crime, and inflation crises.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the DCCC fired back in a statement to Fox News Digital, saying, &quot;Facts matter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’ve seen record job growth over the last two years, inflation has come down significantly, and it&apos;s Republicans who defend violent insurrectionists and their wannabe dictator in chief as they stand trial,&quot; Viet Shelton said. &quot;Only Democrats are fighting to lower health care costs, make the ultra wealthy pay their fair share, support a bipartisan border security deal, and protect reproductive freedom for everyone, everywhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The defining traits of this House Republican majority have been dysfunction, chaos, and a steady sprint to the far-right at all costs – and voters are sick and tired of it,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-divided-on-anti-israel-pro-palestinian-college-campus-protests-republicans-united-poll&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW POLL REVEALS HOW MANY DEMS AGREE WITH DEMANDS OF ANTI-ISRAEL CAMPUS PROTESTERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats continue to hold a major cash advantage in the race for control of the House of Representatives, Fox News Digital &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-2024-advantage-house-republicans-chaos-division&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;reported last month&lt;/a&gt;, as Republicans attempt to grow their slim majority in the chamber this November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bright spot for Republicans, however, is that the NRCC&apos;s current cash-on-hand deficit is smaller than it was at the same point in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections/2022/midterm-results&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;2022 and 2020 election cycles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In March 2022, the DCCC had $18.5 million more cash on hand than the NRCC, but Republicans gained nine seats that November. That difference was a massive $31.9 million in 2020, but Republicans still went on to gain 13 seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;House Republicans remain in a strong position to grow the majority. Meanwhile, extreme House Democrats continue to support dangerous open borders, pro-crime and pro-inflationary policies that doomed their majority in the first place,&quot; NRCC spokesman Will Reinert told Fox News Digital in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Brandon Gillespie contributed to this report&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Speaker Johnson rips &apos;atrocities&apos; against Trump at Manhattan hush money trial</title>
                    
                    <description>Speaker Mike Johnson panned the cases against former President Trump during comments outside of the Manhattan criminal court on Tuesday morning.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;House Speaker Mike Johnson accused New York City justice officials of committing &quot;atrocities&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ny-v-trump-prosecutors-resume-questioning-michael-cohen-testimony-stormy-daniels-payment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;against former President Trump&lt;/a&gt; in an impassioned set of remarks outside the Manhattan Criminal Court on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson is the latest Trump ally to descend on the Big Apple as the ex-president stands trial for accusations he falsified business documents to cover up a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s impossible for anybody to deny, that looks at this objectively, that the judicial system in our country has been weaponized against President Trump. The system is using all the tools at its disposal right now to punish one president and provide cover for another,&quot; Johnson, R-La., said, referring to GOP-led accusations that President Biden has been shielded by his own Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And meanwhile…among the atrocities here, the judge&apos;s own daughter is making millions of dollars doing online fundraising for Democrats.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michael-cohen-testifies-he-secretly-recorded-trump-lead-up-2016-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL COHEN TESTIFIES HE SECRETLY RECORDED TRUMP IN LEAD-UP TO 2016 ELECTION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson also echoed accusations that Judge Juan Merchan&apos;s daughter, Loren Merchan, is profiting off of the trial via her firm, Authentic Campaigns, which has done work for top Democrats like Vice President Kamala Harris and Rep. Adam Schiff, R-Calif., according to the industry site &lt;a href=&quot;https://campaignsandelections.com/awards/rising-stars/2020-rising-stars/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Campaigns &amp;amp; Elections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump himself is under a partial gag order after lobbing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-highly-conflicted-judge-after-first-day-michael-cohens-testimony-wraps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;similar accusations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s so corrupt, it&apos;s so corrupt and everybody knows it,&quot; Johnson continued on Tuesday. &quot;If [Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg] thinks the American people will believe these absurd charges, take a look at the turnout at Trump events.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to Authentic Campaigns and the New York Courts system for comment, as well as a spokesperson for Bragg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-cohens-credibility-issues-brazen-tiktok-usage-raise-media-eyebrows-ahead-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL COHEN&apos;S CREDIBILITY ISSUES, BRAZEN TIKTOK USAGE RAISE MEDIA EYEBROWS AHEAD OF TESTIMONY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson further argued that the Manhattan trial was the latest in a series of &quot;partisan witch hunts&quot; against Trump and vowed the House of Representatives would look at ways to &quot;rein in&quot; special counsel Jack Smith. Smith is investigating Trump for his alleged efforts to upend his 2020 election loss and his handling of classified documents after leaving office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That one is so egregious, the trial&apos;s been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/federal-judge-postpones-trumps-classified-records-trial-indefinitely&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;indefinitely postponed&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; Johnson said of the classified documents case. &quot;I&apos;m working with Chairman [Jim] Jordan of the House Judiciary Committee and Chairman [James] Comer of our Oversight committee on measures to rein in the abuses of special counsel Jack Smith.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the multiple cases against Trump amount to &quot;election interference.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ny-v-trump-cohen-testifies-paying-stormy-daniels-his-own-pocket&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NY V TRUMP: COHEN TESTIFIES TO PAYING STORMY DANIELS FROM HIS OWN POCKET&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Republican is the highest-ranking federal official to show public support for Trump so far, demonstrating the commanding hold he has over the GOP, including Johnson&apos;s own razor-thin House majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Johnson, former 2024 presidential candidate-turned-Trump surrogate Vivek Ramaswamy also planned to attend the ex-president&apos;s trial on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., also posted on X that he was in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Great to meet with President Trump today prior to us heading to the courtroom. I&apos;m honored to stand with the President, as America stands with him, and I view this victimless sham indictment as political theater and interference,&quot; Mills wrote.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Chris Pratt says raising his daughters is different than raising his son, adding that &amp;quot;girls are more emotional.&amp;quot;</description>

News&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;They&apos;ve got me wrapped around their finger. It&apos;s wild.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/chris-pratt-praises-god-backlash-social-media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHRIS PRATT SEEMINGLY RESPONDS TO SOCIAL MEDIA BACKLASH OVER &apos;HEALTHY DAUGHTER&apos; COMMENTS, PRAISES GOD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pratt has two daughters, Lyla, 3, and Eloise, 2, with second wife &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/katherine-schwarzenegger-pratt-how-met-husband-chris-pratt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Katherine Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt;. He shares his son Jack, 11, with ex-wife Anna Faris. While all three of his children are &quot;cuddly and snuggly,&quot; Pratt knows his girls &quot;don&apos;t like to rough house as much.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ll hit them with a pillow, and they&apos;ll go, &apos;Daddy, that hurt my feelings,&apos;&quot; he said of playing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/kids&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;his girls&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;They like to hear stories more than they like to wrestle.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area where Pratt notices a &quot;big difference&quot; between his daughters and son is how much planning is required for their daily schedules. Pratt says his daughters &quot;take after their mother, who is incredibly organized.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But even the differences between my two daughters,&quot; he continued, &quot;just goes to show that every child is a little bit different.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pratt, who rarely shares glimpses of his children, has been scrutinized in the past for how he speaks about his kids. Following the birth of his and Schwarzenegger&apos;s first daughter, Pratt wrote a tribute to his wife on Instagram. &quot;She’s given me an amazing life, a gorgeous healthy daughter, she chews so loudly that sometimes i put in my ear buds to drown it out, but that’s love!&quot; he wrote in part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CVynGLRp_ju/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APP USERS CLICK HERE TO VIEW INSTAGRAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people felt that Pratt&apos;s mention of his &quot;healthy daughter&quot; was a direct jab at his ex, Farris, who gave birth to their son prematurely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, with three young children, Pratt just wants to be available for his kids, opting to take roles that afford him the opportunity to be at home. &quot;It works nicely to have a job that allows me to put my kids to bed at night and be present,&quot; he said, as the star of the upcoming film, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Garfield Movie&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing &quot;voice work,&quot; Pratt explains, &quot;means that&apos;s a movie I don&apos;t have to be on the road.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>GOP AG in Trump courtroom predicts a ‘really bad day’ for Michael Cohen cross-examination</title>
                    
                    <description>GOP Attorney General Steve Marshall sat in the Manhattan courtroom Monday and predicted a &amp;quot;really bad day&amp;quot; for the prosecution&amp;apos;s star witness on Tuesday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;GOP Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall sat in the Manhattan courtroom Monday for the unprecedented criminal trial of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;former President Trump&lt;/a&gt; and predicted a &quot;really bad day&quot; for the prosecution&apos;s star witness on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marshall, a 30-year veteran prosecutor, was in court supporting Trump, telling Fox News Digital the trial is what the former president &quot;rightly believes is a sham of a prosecution.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Cohen, Trump&apos;s ex-lawyer and self-proclaimed &quot;fixer,&quot; testified for hours Monday and took the stand again for cross-examination on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Fox News Digital, Marshall said he predicted a &quot;really bad day&quot; for Cohen, considered the prosecution team&apos;s star witness, facing questioning from Trump&apos;s defense team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ny-v-trump-resume-star-witness-michael-cohen-expected&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NY V. TRUMP TRIAL RESUMES WITH &apos;STAR WITNESS&apos; MICHAEL COHEN EXPECTED TO TAKE THE STAND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Michael Cohen is going to have a really bad day,&quot; Marshall said. &quot;He&apos;s got a lot of explaining to do, and the only thing the jury is going to be able to conclude is that while Michael Cohen made a career on monetizing his relationship with Donald Trump, his testimony in this case was designed to monetize his ability to get Donald Trump a conviction, and that is not going to play very well&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marshall said &quot;the best resolution&quot; to this case, in his view, is for the court to enter a judgment of acquittal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And by the time the defense team has this testimony, he&apos;s going to be completely discredited,&quot; Marshall said, adding that he believes the defense will move for an acquittal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What seemingly gets lost in the discussion is what this case is about, and that is, false business entries into the records on Trump that inherently, according to the prosecution, lead to some other criminal offense, some conspiracy to commit some other crime. And I haven&apos;t seen it,&quot; Marshall said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And the discussion about the NDA negotiations with Stormy Daniels&apos; lawyers, the references to what took place, had no bearing on what the prosecution ultimately has to prove – which is that Donald Trump was aware of false entries, did so with a fraudulent intent and that that was designed to be able to commit another offense – which is yet has not been disclosed,&quot; Marshall added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ny-v-trump-cohen-testifies-paying-stormy-daniels-his-own-pocket&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NY V TRUMP: COHEN TESTIFIES TO PAYING STORMY DANIELS FROM HIS OWN POCKET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And sitting through what I think is almost all of the direct examination of Michael Cohen… There still is no link and there still is no nexus to the man who was charged with this offense,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen is said to be the star witness for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and his team as they try to prove the former president falsified business records related to a $130,000 payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/speaker-johnson-attend-trump-trial-manhattan-show-support&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPEAKER JOHNSON TO ATTEND TRUMP TRIAL IN MANHATTAN IN SHOW OF SUPPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bragg charged Trump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges and maintains his innocence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, for years, has denied the encounter with Daniels ever happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump later made several payments of $35,000 to Cohen, who was serving as his personal attorney at the time. The payments totaled $420,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The payments from Trump to Cohen are the basis for Bragg’s indictment of Trump. Bragg is trying to prove that the payments were reimbursements to Cohen for the hush money payment to Daniels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Trump defense attorneys maintain that the $35,000 payments were &quot;not a payback,&quot; but were, instead, legal payments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marshall said Bragg&apos;s case against Trump is an &quot;affront&quot; to what state prosecutors are meant to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve worked in the criminal justice system as a voice for victims in law enforcement. I care desperately about what that system represents and what it is that prosecutors are supposed to do, and this case is an affront to that,&quot; Marshall told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bragg&apos;s office did not respond to Fox News Digital&apos;s request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
