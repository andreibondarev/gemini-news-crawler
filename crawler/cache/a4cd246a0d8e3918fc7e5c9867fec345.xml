                    <description>Ukraine has reduced its military conscription age as a measure to bolster its forces depleted by over two years of war following Russia&amp;apos;s full-scale invasion.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ukraine on Wednesday lowered the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;military conscription&lt;/a&gt; age from 27 to 25 in an effort to replenish its depleted ranks after more than two years of war following Russia’s full-scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new mobilization law came into force a day after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed it. Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, passed it last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear why Zelenskyy took so long to sign the measure into law. He didn’t make any public comment about it, and officials did not say how many new soldiers the country expected to gain or for which units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/situation-in-ukraine-is-dire-as-ammunition-supplies-drop-on-us-europe-starvation-diet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SITUATION IN UKRAINE IS &apos;DIRE&apos; AS AMMUNITION SUPPLIES DROP ON US, EUROPE &apos;STARVATION DIET&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conscription has been a sensitive matter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; for many months amid a growing shortage of infantry on top of a severe ammunition shortfall that has handed Russia the battlefield initiative. Russia’s own problems with manpower and planning have so far prevented it from taking full advantage of its edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average age of Ukrainian soldiers, like those on the Russian side, is around 40, military analysts say. Some Ukrainians worry that taking young adults out of the workforce will backfire by further harming the war-ravaged economy, but the problem reportedly has become acute as Kyiv girds for an expected summer offensive by the Kremlin’s forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial enthusiasm for going out to fight against the Kremlin’s forces has waned, though public support for the war remains high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine currently forbids men younger than 60 from traveling abroad. Many Ukrainian men are evading the draft by hiding at home or trying to bribe their way out of the battle. Commanders say they don’t have enough soldiers to launch offensives, and barely enough to hold positions during intensifying Russian assaults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/russias-war-ukraine-unlikely-end-2024-congress-plays-pivotal-role-direction-conflict-takes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUSSIA&apos;S WAR ON UKRAINE UNLIKELY TO END IN 2024; CONGRESS PLAYS PIVOTAL ROLE IN DIRECTION CONFLICT TAKES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia’s population is more than three times as large as Ukraine’s, and President Vladimir Putin has shown a willingness to force men to the front if not enough volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelenskyy has rarely mentioned the mobilization issue, and parliament attached more than 1,000 amendments to the mobilization bill he signed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last December, Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s military wanted to mobilize up to 500,000 more troops. But he said he had asked the top brass to spell out the details on what is &quot;a very sensitive matter&quot; before deciding whether to grant their wish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a major mobilization would cost Ukraine the equivalent of $13.4 billion, Zelenskyy said at the time. Other aspects to be considered include whether troops currently on the front would be rotated or allowed home leave, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need for a broad mobilization to beef up the number of Ukrainian troops reportedly was one of the areas of disagreement between Zelenskyy and Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the popular commander in chief of Ukraine’s armed forces whom the president replaced in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian Defense Ministry statistics say the Ukrainian military had nearly 800,000 troops in October. That doesn’t include National Guard or other units. In total, 1 million Ukrainians are in uniform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Ukraine’s air force said it shot down four drones that Russia launched overnight over central provinces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An 11-year-old boy died in a hospital from injuries sustained during &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Russia’s attack&lt;/a&gt; in the Kupiansk area on Tuesday, according to Kharkiv regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov. His 58-year-old father was killed in the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelenskyy said Wednesday that Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, &quot;sees daily humiliation and pain&quot; from unrelenting Russian aerial attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian attacks all across the country are &quot;wreaking havoc,&quot; Zelenskyy wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in an appeal for Ukraine&apos;s Western partners to supply more air defense systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March alone, the Kremlin’s forces launched more than 400 missiles of various types, 600 Iranian-designed Shahed drones, and more than 3,000 guided aerial bombs against Ukraine, he said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Powerful earthquake rocks Taiwan, death toll rising, 800 injured</title>
                    
                    <description>An earthquake in Taiwan resulted in nine deaths, some buildings collapsing and a tsunami warning, officials said Wednesday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An earthquake rocked the entire island &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/asia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;of Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; early Wednesday, killing nine, injuring hundreds, collapsing buildings in a southern city and sparking a brief tsunami warning for southern Japanese islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&apos;s fire department said nine people have died in the mountainous, sparsely populated eastern county of Hualien, where the earthquake&apos;s epicenter was located. More than 800 people were injured in the incident and authorities lost contact with 50 people aboard four minibuses heading to a hotel in a national park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 26 buildings have collapsed, with more than half in the city of Hualien. Nearly 80 people were trapped as rescue work continued, the government said. Fire authorities said about 60 of the people trapped were caught in a tunnel just north of Hualien city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fire authorities said they were slowly evacuating some of the people trapped in the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/earthquakes-japan-kill-officials-race-save-people-trapped-homes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;EARTHQUAKES IN JAPAN KILL AT LEAST 48 AS OFFICIALS RACE TO SAVE PEOPLE TRAPPED IN HOMES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video and images on social media showed buildings shaken off their foundations. A five-story building in lightly populated Hualien appeared heavily damaged, collapsing its first floor and leaving the rest leaning at a 45-degree angle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the capital, Taipei, tiles fell from older buildings and within some newer office complexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Geological Survey put the 9.6 mile quake at a 7.4 magnitude, while Taiwan’s earthquake monitoring agency gave it a magnitude of 7.2. The effects of the earthquake were felt as far away as Kinmen, a Taiwanese-controlled island off the coast of China, said Wu Chien-fu, the head of Taiwan&apos;s earthquake monitoring bureau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple aftershocks were recorded, and the USGS said one of the subsequent quakes measured 6.5 magnitude and 7.8 miles deep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tsunami warning was issued for coastal areas of southwestern &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Japan&apos;s Miyakojima and Yaeyama regions&lt;/a&gt; and the main island of Okinawa, Japanese public broadcaster NHK World reported. A tsunami wave about 1 ft. high was detected on the coast of Yonaguni island about 15 minutes after the quake struck, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. The tsunami warning was downgraded to an advisory before it was lifted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Train service across the island of 23 million people was suspended. In Taipei, children were seen going to school and the morning commute appeared normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center initially said it was reviewing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/earthquakes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the earthquake&lt;/a&gt; to determine whether a tsunami was a threat to the West Coast states of California, Oregon and Washington, as well as Alaska and the Canadian province of British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tsunami NOT expected,&quot; the agency posted on X minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/japan-marks-fukushima-nuclear-disaster-13-years-later-pledges-recover-any-cost&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAPAN MARKS FUKUSHIMA NUCLEAR DISASTER 13 YEARS LATER, PLEDGES TO RECOVER &apos;AT ANY COST&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawaii&apos;s Emergency Management Agency also said there was no tsunami threat to the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quake was believed to be the biggest in Taiwan since a temblor in 1999 caused extensive damage. Taiwan lies along the Pacific &quot;Ring of Fire,&quot; a line of seismic faults encircling the Pacific Ocean where most of the world&apos;s earthquakes occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Comedian Bert Kreischer realizes former MLB pitcher was high school foe: &apos;I used to bat off you&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>When speaking with former MLB closer Danny Graves on &amp;quot;The Rally,&amp;quot; comedian Bert Kreischer realized he used to play against him in high school.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Bert Kreischer&lt;/a&gt; is now one of the best-known comedians in the world, but as a high schooler, he played baseball against some of the game&apos;s best – and he didn&apos;t even realize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 51-year-old comedian, who earned the nickname &quot;The Machine&quot; from his insane partying days at Florida State, was a guest on &quot;The Rally,&quot; a sports talk show on the Stadium app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kreischer was talking to host Dani Klupenger and former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MLB closer Danny Graves&lt;/a&gt;, when the comedian swiftly mentioned that he ironically used to play baseball against someone named Danny Graves while attending high school in Tampa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klupenger then let Kreischer know that he was speaking to &quot;&lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; Danny Graves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graves told Kreischer he attended Brandon High School just outside the Tampa area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Buddy, I used to bat off you,&quot; a stunned Kreischer replied, saying he attended nearby Jesuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So you were there with [former MLB pitcher] Brad Radke?&quot; asked Graves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Brad Radke, I was his catcher,&quot; answered Kreischer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Danny Graves, are you freaking kidding me? Danny Graves threw heat!&quot; Kreischer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It got even better, though – Kreischcer apparently had no idea what became of Graves&apos; baseball days, asking if he played in college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graves played much more than just college – he suited up for three MLB teams in a respectable 11-year career, two of which he was named an All-Star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klupenger told Kreischer that Graves was recently named to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/cincinnati-reds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt; Hall of Fame, as he was their closer for several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/as-batting-average-leader-sent-down-because-he-needs-get-base-gm-says&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&apos;S BATTING AVERAGE LEADER SENT DOWN BECAUSE HE &apos;NEEDS TO GET ON BASE,&apos; GM SAYS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You went on to play pro?!&quot; Kreischer hilariously asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Danny Graves and Bert Kreischer back together again. Is it crazy, that&apos;s how good of a baseball player you were when we were kids, is that I have always remembered your name.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheRally/status/1775295898735501673&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW MOMENT ON X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graves recorded 121 saves from 1999 to 2002 with Cincinnati, pitching to a 3.21 ERA, and the Reds made him a starter the following year. But the experiment failed, as he racked up a 5.33 ERA in 2003. He went back to the bullpen the following year and posted a career-high 41 saves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a brief stint with the Mets in 2005, he retired after spending the 2006 season with Cleveland, his first MLB team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Ron Eller won a Republican primary runoff in Mississippi’s 2nd Congressional District. Eller will face longtime Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson in the Nov. 5 general election.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ron Eller won a Republican primary runoff Tuesday in Mississippi’s 2nd Congressional District and will face longtime Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson in the Nov. 5 general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eller, who is a military veteran and physician assistant, defeated Andrew Scott Smith, who has worked in farming and commercial real estate. They had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mississippi-runoff-determine-republican-runs-against-longtime-democratic-incumbent-congressman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;advanced to the Republican runoff&lt;/a&gt; as the top candidates in a three-person primary March 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson has represented the majority-Black district since winning a special election in 1993, and President Joe Biden won the district by 27 percentage points in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/mississippi-catfish-farms-settle-suit-claiming-immigrants-paid-more-black-workers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISSISSIPPI CATFISH FARMS SETTLE SUIT CLAIMING IMMIGRANTS WERE PAID MORE THAN BLACK WORKERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson is the ranking Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee and was unopposed for his party’s nomination in the district this year. Thompson said he wants to decrease &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/big-pharma-answer-american-people&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;prescription drug costs&lt;/a&gt;, invest in historically Black colleges and universities, reduce student loan debt and build the middle class &quot;by making sure the wealthy pay their fair share.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eller, who ran unsuccessfully for the 2nd District Republican nomination in 2022, has said he supports construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall and expansion of domestic energy production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After winning the runoff Tuesday, Eller told The Associated Press that he believes all Americans want good places to raise their families, with strong schools and clean air and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s time to put that party nonsense behind us,&quot; Eller said. &quot;We need to work as a people and a nation together.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district stretches along &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/mississippi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt; on the western side of the state, through the flatlands of the Delta and into the capital of Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voters in the 2nd District supported Democrat Joe Biden over Republican Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, 63% to 36%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

There is an indoor and outdoor ride at the hotel that are each filled with stunning views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Vegas trip is complete without a photo in front of the iconic &quot;Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas&quot; sign. It is located on the south end of the Strip, fairly close to the Mandalay Bay Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go hotel hopping! The Strip is filled with hotels that are worth taking a walk through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hotels on the Strip are huge, all filled with their own shops, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/restaurants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;all kinds of restaurants&lt;/a&gt;, casinos, shows and exhibits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take some time to explore each of the hotels and see what they have to offer.

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space/nasa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NASA wants&lt;/a&gt; to come up with an out-of-this-world way to keep track of time, putting the moon on its own souped-up clock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not quite a time zone like those on Earth, but an entire frame of time reference for the moon. Because there&apos;s less gravity on the moon, time there moves a tad quicker — 58.7 microseconds every day — compared to Earth. So the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday instructed NASA and other U.S agencies to work with international agencies to come up with a new moon-centric time reference system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;An atomic clock on the moon will tick at a different rate than a clock on Earth,&quot; said Kevin Coggins, NASA&apos;s top communications and navigation official. &quot;It makes sense that when you go to another body, like the moon or Mars that each one gets its own heartbeat.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/science/earths-changing-spin-timekeepers-subtract-second-world-clocks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EARTH&apos;S CHANGING SPIN MAY CAUSE TIMEKEEPERS TO SUBTRACT A SECOND FROM WORLD CLOCKS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So everything on the moon will operate on the speeded-up moon time, Coggins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time NASA sent astronauts to the moon they wore watches, but timing wasn&apos;t as precise and critical as it now with GPS, satellites and intricate computer and communications systems, he said. Those microseconds matter when high tech systems interact, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the European Space Agency said Earth needs to come up with a unified time for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space/moon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the moon&lt;/a&gt;, where a day lasts 29.5 Earth days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Space Station, being in low Earth orbit, will continue to use coordinated universal time or UTC. But just where the new space time kicks in is something that NASA has to figure out. Even Earth&apos;s time speeds up and slows down, requiring leap seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike on Earth, the moon will not have daylight saving time, Coggins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House wants NASA to come up with a preliminary idea by the end of the year and have a final plan by the end of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NASA is aiming to send astronauts around the moon in September 2025 and land people there a year later.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Top 5 Tiger Woods moments from his Masters career</title>
                    
                    <description>Tiger Woods and the Masters are synonymous, as he&amp;apos;s won the tournament five times over his legendary career. Here are his Top 5 best moments at Augusta National Golf Club.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/golf/the-masters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2024 Masters&lt;/a&gt; is right around the corner, and while many are looking forward to seeing stars like Rory McIlory, Scottie Scheffler and the reigning champion, Jon Rahm, Tiger Woods’ presence at Augusta National Golf Club, which the field currently states, is always a huge draw. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tiger-woods&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Woods’ 15 major tournament wins&lt;/a&gt; have come at Augusta, and there have been a multitude of iconic moments for him at the Masters, leaving golf fans with memories for a lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to boil down Woods’ greatness at Augusta into just a few moments, but these five stand out above the rest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods’ third green jacket came in 2002, when he was favored to win the tournament again after having captured the title the year prior (more on that later). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entering Sunday, Nick Faldo had been the only PGA Tour player to defend his Masters title, which came in 1990. Woods was already 11-under entering the final round, and though he shot a 1-under 71, he was never threatened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods finished with a three-shot lead, as Retief Goosen shot 2-over on his round to finish 9-over. Woods’ reign over majors continued as he’d later win the 2002 U.S. Open that year as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2000, Woods won the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/golf/pga-championship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;PGA Championship&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. Open and Open Championship. Would he get to hoist the trophy at four majors in a row? You bet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forever marked as the &quot;Tiger Slam,&quot; Woods shot 16-under for the tournament, beating out David Duval by two strokes and Phil Mickelson by three, and there were plenty of iconic moments in this tournament that made sure he captured his second career green jacket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tiger-woods-ex-wife-elin-nordegren-briefly-reunite-support-son-charlie-ceremony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIGER WOODS, EX-WIFE ELIN NORDEGREN BRIEFLY REUNITE TO SUPPORT SON, CHARLIE, AT CEREMONY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods had shot an opening round 70, and he didn’t look quite like himself. However, the second round saw just the spark he needed when he had a tough shot from 253 yards out on Hole 8. But he got the ball on the green, and two-putted on the par-5 hole to birdie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods would finish that round with a 66, vaulting himself up the leaderboard to tied-second with an 8-under tournament. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a third round 68, Woods would battle with David Duval in the final round. He established his lead on Hole 11, hitting an approach shot from 145 yards out to have a tap-in birdie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t quite what Bobby Jones did in 1930, when he won all four majors in the same calendar year. But Woods’ majors run is something no one has been able to replicate since. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you win your first career Masters and major? You blow out the competition in Augusta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most dominant major performances of all time, Woods finished 18-under for the tournament, with Tom Kite at 6-under being the runner-up. The margin of victory remains the largest in Masters history, and his four-day scoring record of 270 stood until Dustin Johnson broke it in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheMasters/status/1248375888695013376&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW THE MOMENT ON X.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There it is – a win for the ages!&quot; Jim Nantz said on the Masters broadcast, which was seen by an estimated 44 million viewers, as Woods became the youngest, and first non-White, golfer to win the Masters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To think he started the tournament 4-over in his first nine holes seems baffling, but it was only up from there as he blew past the competition and embraced his father, Earl Woods, after draining his final putt on 18 on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tiger-woods-disappointed-after-withdrawing-genesis-invitational-due-illness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIGER WOODS ‘DISAPPOINTED’ AFTER WITHDRAWING FROM GENESIS INVITATIONAL DUE TO ILLNESS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many will tell you of the magic Woods pulled on No. 16 at Augusta in the final round of the weekend, which was mired by rain most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods shot an opening round 74, but posted a 66 and 65 in the second and third rounds, respectively, to be paired with Chris DiMarco heading into Sunday. They battled all day long, but on No. 16, DiMarco hit a shot right in the center of the par-3 green, while Woods pulled his tee shot just left off the green. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods stepped into about a 50-yard chip, hoping he could use the contour of the green to get it close and tap in for par. What transpired as he hit a clean chip to the left side of the green was the greatest Masters shot of all time, as the ball trickled its way toward the hole. If the suspense wasn’t high enough with a clear chance to see it fall for birdie, the ball appeared to stop at the lip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only for a second before it fell into the hole and Woods, along with the crowd around the green, erupted in celebration. Broadcaster Verne Lundquist’s iconic, &quot;In your life have you seen anything like that?!&quot; call forever lives alongside Woods’ miraculous make. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sportsbyfry/status/1248042419506917378&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW THE MOMENT ON X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods and DiMarco would end up in a playoff to determine who won the tournament. Playing Hole 18 again, DiMarco tapped his ball in for par and hoped Woods didn’t bury his 15-foot birdie putt, but after a long look, he drained it for the victory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the fourth green jacket is quite the feat, Woods’ chip-in is arguably the best shot of his career. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods had multiple second-place finishes following his 2005 victory, but his life off the course appeared to impact his game. He dealt with his personal scandal in late November 2009, which ultimately led to him apologizing for his infidelity.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’d continue competing on Tour and in the Masters, but he was never able to have the same success. In 2013, he even admitted in a post-round ESPN interview that he had an illegal drop on the par-5 15th hole, though he wasn’t disqualified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back injuries would also ail Woods in the years leading up to the 2019 Masters, where the improbable occurred. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods posted a 70, 68 and 67 in his first three rounds of the tournament, putting him tied-second with Tony Finau heading into the final round on Sunday. Francesco Molinari was two strokes ahead of them in first place at 13-under, but there was a sense from the crowd that Woods’ 15th major win was on the horizon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1511078402165461002&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW THE MOMENT ON X.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molinari held the lead for 11 holes, but the infamous Rae’s Creek on No. 12 swallowed his tee shot and forced him to double bogey. Woods was at 11-under at that point, and Molinari was now tied with him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods would pull away at No. 15, birdying the hole to take the lead at 13-under. Meanwhile, Dustin Johnson finished his round at 12-under for the tournament and Xander Schauffele and Brooks Koepka would go on to do the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Woods would birdie No. 16 and par No. 17, which led to him walking over to Hole 18 with a two-shot lead, needing only a bogey to clinch the victory. That’s exactly what Woods would do, and though it wasn’t the best hole, it was the perfect ending to a Masters that some believed Woods wouldn’t win again in his career. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The iconic moment of hugging his son, Charlie, as he walked off the 18th green, knowing all the fight and determination to get back into the winner’s circle at a major had paid off, pulls at the heart strings today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chip-in is legendary, but Wood was still in his golfing prime then. The fact he was able to take home his fifth green jacket after not winning a major since the 2008 U.S. Open is as legendary as it gets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>LAURA INGRAHAM: J.K. Rowling and Trump are threats to the left</title>
                    
                    <description>Fox News host Laura Ingraham calls out alleged censorship by liberals and draws parallels in the attacks on former President Trump and J.K. Rowling on &amp;quot;The Ingraham Angle.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News host Laura Ingraham compares the efforts of former President Donald Trump and &quot;Harry Potter&quot; author J.K. Rowling to stand against alleged liberal attempts at suppression Tuesday on &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Ingraham Angle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LAURA INGRAHAM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&apos;m certain J.K. Rowling would recoil at being compared to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/integrity-ny-legal-system-stake-trump-appeals-civil-fraud-case-jonathan-turley-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;. The lifelong feminist holds views antithetical to his, but when the far left in the U.K. started a petition to ban Trump from traveling there, she, a true liberal, drew a line. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/shakira-shreds-barbie-movie-saying-emasculating-sons-absolutely-hated&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SHAKIRA SHREDS &apos;BARBIE&apos; MOVIE, SAYING IT WAS &apos;EMASCULATING&apos; FOR HER SONS: &apos;ABSOLUTELY HATED IT&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whether she likes it or not, Trump and she have something important in common. They&apos;re both threats to the New Inquisition. You know, the self-appointed enforcers of progressive conformity, the anti-free speech radicals who are threatened by anyone (and I mean anyone) who boldly expresses views that conflict or challenge their own. Now, just as it would have been a lot easier, let&apos;s face it, for Trump to steer clear from politics in 2015 or retire after 2020, it would have been far easier for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/jk-rowling-dares-police-arrest-says-free-speech-end-scotland-new-hate-crime-bill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;J.K. Rowling&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to back away from her views on transgenderism.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For believing that a man is a man and a woman is a woman, she&apos;s been called a &quot;vicious transphobe&quot; and subject to relentless criticism from many, by the way, of her former friends. Even when Scotland passed a so-called anti-hate speech law, instead of shutting up, she wrapped it up, daring Scottish authorities to arrest her. Now police, undoubtedly wanting to sidestep the firestorm where the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; author [would] actually be charged, announced earlier today that she didn&apos;t violate the law, which says that the prosecution need only prove that her remark was likely, rather than intended, to offend members of class as defined by things like age, disability, faith, sexual orientation, transgender identity, or being intersex.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Top GOP super PAC reveals first round of &apos;trailblazer&apos; candidate endorsements: &apos;Proven track records&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>The Congressional Leadership Fund made its first round of endorsements in the 2024 cycle, selecting 20 Republican candidates to support throughout their campaigns.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST ON FOX&lt;/strong&gt;: The Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) dropped its first round of &quot;trailblazer&quot; endorsements for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2024 election cycle&lt;/a&gt;, a major advancement in Republican efforts to expand their slim House majority in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLF, a top Republican super PAC closely aligned with House Speaker Mike Johnson that supports and invests in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/republicans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Republican congressional campaigns&lt;/a&gt; across the country, made 20 key House endorsements Wednesday that were shared first with Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout their campaigns, the selected Republican candidates will receive financial support from the group&apos;s Trailblazers Fund, a hard-dollar arm set up ahead of the 2018 midterm elections to fund high-priority congressional campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-blast-departing-gop-lawmakers-razor-thin-majority&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;REPUBLICANS BLAST DEPARTING GOP LAWMAKERS AS RAZOR-THIN MAJORITY FUELS FEARS OF DEM TAKEOVER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 20 candidates receiving the backing of the GOP group are as follows: Nancy Dahlstrom (AK-AL), Kevin Lincoln (CA-09), Scott Baugh (CA-47), Gabe Evans (CO-08), George Logan (CT-05), Joe McGraw (IL-17), Randy Niemeyer (IN-01), Prasanth Reddy (KS-03), Austin Theriault (ME-02), Tom Barrett (MI-07), Joe Teirab (MN-02), Laurie Buckhout (NC-01), Yvette Herrell (NM-02), Alison Esposito (NY-18), Orlando Sonza (OH-01), Derek Merrin (OH-09)&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;Kevin Coughlin (OH-13), Rob Bresnahan (PA-08), Rob Mercuri (PA-17) and Derrick Anderson (VA-07).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-warm-social-security-medicare-reform-2024-election-nears&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;REPUBLICANS WARM TO SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE REFORM AS 2024 ELECTION NEARS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These candidates have proven they have what it takes to connect with voters and win in battleground districts,&quot; said CLF President Dan Conston in a statement. &quot;For the third straight cycle, House Republicans have had tremendous recruits in swing seats — and that can make all the difference. With the right resources, we will be well-positioned to hold and grow the House Majority come November.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLF noted that its endorsements are carefully picked for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/campaigning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;identifying campaigns&lt;/a&gt; led by &quot;standout candidates with proven track records of tangible achievement and impressive character.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also made several endorsements in the 2022 midterms, spending roughly $250 million in its successful effort to regain the majority in the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans are protecting a rather slim majority in the chamber this cycle after several members have either announced they will not seek re-election in the fall or have fully resigned ahead of the November election. Rep. Rep Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., recently announced an early exit from his seat, leaving the GOP with a temporary one-seat majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the CLF begins its focus on the initial 20 standout candidates, and likely running ads for the endorsed candidates, the recent departures make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;House GOP pickup opportunities&lt;/a&gt; and strategic investments that much more crucial going into the fall election.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A teenage girl who had been kidnapped by her father was following a deputy’s orders and appeared to be surrendering when she was fatally shot by other deputies in California.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;California teenage girl&lt;/a&gt; who had been kidnapped by her father followed a sheriff’s deputy’s orders and appeared to be surrendering when she was shot and killed by other deputies during a gun battle on a highway in 2022, newly released video and audio shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savannah Graziano, 15, was shot and killed as she ran toward San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies amid the gunfire on Sept. 27, 2022. Her father, 45-year-old Anthony Graziano, was also killed by gunfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheriff’s department released the video and audio clips last week following public records requests by several news outlets. The deputies were not wearing body cameras, but video footage was recorded by a sheriff’s helicopter and witness dashboard cameras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the shooting of Savannah and her father, deputies pursued Mr. Graziano&apos;s pickup truck for roughly 70 miles, including along Highway 15. A helicopter crew following the chase said shots were fired from the driver&apos;s side of the truck, and a deputy and passing motorist said other shots were fired from the passenger’s side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-helicopter-crew-rescues-man-clinging-cliff-face-falling-60-feet-trail&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CALIFORNIA HELICOPTER CREW RESCUES MAN CLINGING TO CLIFF AFTER FALLING 60 FEET OFF TRAIL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear who was shooting from the truck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Graziano&apos;s truck and deputy vehicles stopped on the desert interstate east of Los Angeles in Hesperia, located about 35 miles north of Fontana, where he had shot and killed his estranged wife Tracy Martinez, who is also Savannah&apos;s mother, the day before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savannah was just steps from making it safely to a deputy when she was fatally shot, the video shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deputy taking cover behind a sheriff’s department SUV repeatedly shouts to Savannah, &quot;Passenger, get out!&quot; and &quot;Come to me, come to me!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl, who was wearing tactical gear and a helmet, exits the pickup truck&apos;s passenger side and runs toward the deputy, briefly crouching on the ground as the deputy continues to shout commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, as she rises from her crouch and starts making her way toward the deputy, other deputies from a higher elevation open fire. The deputy screams, &quot;Stop! Stop shooting her! He&apos;s in the car! Stop!&quot; Savannah was unarmed as the shooting unfolded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deputy’s orders to stop shooting were not broadcast over the radio, but the audio was captured by his belt recorder, the sheriff&apos;s department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, no,&quot; a deputy in the helicopter was heard saying over the radio after the girl was shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials would not disclose for months whether Savannah was killed by her father or the deputies. In the newly released video, the narrator said she and her father were struck by deputy rounds and died of their injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sheriff&apos;s department&lt;/a&gt; has not released autopsy results for Savannah, her father or her mother. The department also has not identified the deputies involved in the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/police-sink-suspected-san-francisco-bay-bandits-after-seafaring-pirates-terrorize-houseboats-yachts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POLICE SINK SUSPECTED SAN FRANCISCO BAY BANDITS AFTER SEAFARING PIRATES TERRORIZE HOUSEBOATS, YACHTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four sheriff’s department vehicles were struck by gunfire during the pursuit, and deputies seized multiple firearms and hundreds of rounds, as well as flash bangs, smoke grenades, body armor and tactical helmets from Graziano&apos;s truck, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state&apos;s Department of Justice, which is investigating the shooting, is required by state law to review any officer-involved shooting resulting in the death of an unarmed civilian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savannah witnessed her mother&apos;s killing from the backseat of her father&apos;s truck but did not jump out to help her, according to authorities. Her father exited the vehicle with a handgun and fired several times at Martinez near an elementary school during the morning drop-off, prompting students and parents to seek cover. He also shot at a father and child near the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graziano had moved out of the family’s home a month or two before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;he killed Martinez&lt;/a&gt; as the couple was going through a divorce, Fontana police said. Savannah left with her father while her younger brother stayed with their mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Pro-life advocates sound alarm on &apos;extreme&apos; Florida abortion vote that Dems hope could swing general election</title>
                    
                    <description>Pro-life advocates spoke to Fox News Digital about Florida becoming the latest abortion battleground as voters are set to weigh in on the issue post Roe v. Wade.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Florida Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; ruled on Monday that a ballot measure enshrining abortion into the state’s constitution can be voted on in November which prominent pro-life advocates tell Fox News Digital will involve a &quot;misleading&quot; playbook that is too &quot;extreme&quot; for Florida voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/florida-supreme-court-approves-abortion-ballot-initiative-upholding-15-week-ban&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Monday’s ruling&lt;/a&gt; upheld a 15-week abortion ban signed into law by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and cleared the way for the imminent enforcement of a 6-week ban, which Democrats have already attacked as &quot;MAGA extremism&quot;, it also approved a ballot measure in November allowing Florida voters to decide whether to enshrine abortion access into the state constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Florida ruling comes shortly after voters in Ohio, where Trump won by 8 points in 2020, overwhelmingly voted in favor of a constitutional amendment allowing abortion. Several pro-life advocates spoke to Fox News Digital about what the post-Roe v. Wade battle will look like in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The abortion businesses pushing this extreme amendment know the heartbeat law is supported by the majority of Floridians and second- and third-trimester abortion is wildly unpopular,&quot; Katie Glenn Daniel, Tampa lawyer and SBA Pro-Life America State Policy Director, told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ohio-voters-approve-amendment-enshrining-abortion-access-state-constitution&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OHIO VOTERS APPROVE AMENDMENT ENSHRINING ABORTION ACCESS INTO STATE CONSTITUTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That’s why they will use tens of millions of dollars like they did in Ohio to use fear and deception because they know their extreme policy is wildly unpopular. Despite the clear fact that emergency care continues to be available to pregnant women in all 50 states, they will rely on the lie women won’t receive medical care and sow confusion that puts women’s lives in danger.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel explained that in order to avoid a similar result as Ohio, prominent Floridians must persuasively articulate what the abortion measure means for residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gov. Ron DeSantis must be at the forefront of protecting Florida from Big Abortion’s attempt to eliminate the rights of unborn children, parents, women, and girls,&quot; Daniel said. &quot;Gov. DeSantis signed protections for babies who feel pain and have a heartbeat into law and now he must lead in defending those protections.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Roe v. Wade was overturned and the issue was given back to the states, Republicans have suffered several defeats at the ballot box that many pundits attribute to poor messaging on abortion from the GOP but some pro-life advocates, including Caitlin Connors, southern regional director for SBA Pro-Life America, have made the case that Democrats are not where the majority of Americans are on abortion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pro-life-groups-reject-media-narrative-gop-cant-win-on-abortion-after-ohio-defeat-not-losing-issue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO-LIFE GROUPS REJECT MEDIA NARRATIVE THAT GOP CAN&apos;T WIN ON ABORTION AFTER OHIO DEFEAT: &apos;NOT A LOSING ISSUE&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The media narrative that late-term abortion is a political winner is wrong. Since Dobbs we’ve seen strong pro-life candidates like Senator Rubio stand strong for life and win,&quot; Connors told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Democrats know their candidates suffer when they get on a debate stage and are confronted directly on the extreme position to legalize 2nd and 3rd trimester abortions, so they are trying to use deceptive amendments to cover their tracks. Their extreme position is not a winner with the American people and Republicans must continue to expose the Democrat position for voters across America.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prominent Democrats have already begun promoting the idea that a wave of turnout for the abortion measure will not only constitutionally override the state’s current abortion bans but could also benefit President Biden’s effort to carry Florida in November which would be a crushing blow to former President Trump’s campaign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;More and more people are realizing how wrong these bans are and you&apos;ve seen it across the country, whenever there have been ballot initiatives, no matter how red the state is, the people rise up for women&apos;s reproductive freedom here,&quot; North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper told reporters during a Biden-Harris campaign conference call on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-record-number-say-abortion-should-be-legal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOX NEWS POLL: RECORD NUMBER SAY ABORTION SHOULD BE LEGAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So the more Republicans do here, the worse it’s going to get for them at the ballot box, as it should, because this is an issue that people care about all across the country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;I think the empirical evidence suggests that we have a good shot for this,&quot; Florida Democratic State Rep. Fentrice Driskell said on the call. &quot;And it’s tough to ignore the electoral implications. The last time that a Democratic presidential candidate won Florida was when there was an anti-abortion measure on the ballot. So this is something that Floridians pay attention to. That was President Barack Obama in 2012. So I am optimistic that it will pass the finish line in November.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans outnumber Democrats in Florida by a wide margin and a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/03/abortion-democrats-2024-election-00133506&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Politico analysis&lt;/a&gt; suggested that recent abortion ballot measures did not significantly boost Democrat turnout. Still, Biden campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodríguez said on the zoom call, &quot;We definitely see Florida in play.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Ohio defeat, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pro-life-groups-give-post-mortem-ohio-issue-1-setback-say-november-will-be-very-different&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;pro-life groups assessed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that part of the reason for the result was being massively outspent and pointed to what they said was misleading language in the abortion amendment, two things that they say must be addressed in Florida. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our campaign will ensure that Florida voters won’t be fooled by the misleading amendment language and ensure that the abortion industry and out of state abortion extremists who have spent nearly $20 million on their campaign so far won’t succeed in their efforts to enact one of the most extreme abortion amendment proposals in America,&quot; Sara Johnson, grassroots director of Florida Voters Against Extremism, told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider,&quot; the ballot measure, known as Amendment 4, states. &quot;This amendment does not change the Legislature’s constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida Republican Attorney General Ashley Moody, in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://acis-api.flcourts.gov/courts/68f021c4-6a44-4735-9a76-5360b2e8af13/cms/case/8ea48e7f-fe8b-4112-aac6-4214b4f8573a/docketentrydocuments/149e5407-d03d-4f99-ae80-438dd6e129f4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;amicus brief&lt;/a&gt; that was denied by the court, argued the wording is misleading for several reasons including not defining the term &quot;viability.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The ballot summary here is part of a … design to lay ticking time bombs that will enable abortion proponents later to argue that the amendment has a much broader meaning than voters would ever have thought,&quot; Moody argued in a previous brief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The ballot language incorrectly implies that the amendment will not impact parental rights when their children seek abortions. Currently, Florida requires parental consent, with limited exceptions, before a physician can perform an abortion on a minor,&quot; SBA Pro-Life America argued in a brief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If the proposed amendment passes, this statute will likely be another casualty. The loss of parental consent is obscured in the ballot language, which highlights that the proposed amendment will not change the constitutional right to parental notification, leading voters to assume that the right to parental consent will be similarly untouched.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/abortion-pills-spiked-recent-years-new-report-reveals-substantial-increase&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABORTION PILL USE HAS SPIKED IN RECENT YEARS, NEW REPORT REVEALS: ‘SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not only will this measure bring dangerous late-term abortions back to Florida, but it will allow girls who aren’t old enough to get their ears pierced on their own get an abortion without a parent’s okay,&quot; SBA added in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://sbaprolife.org/newsroom/press-releases/leading-pro-life-group-responds-to-florida-supreme-court-rulings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Those girls and the women who have abortions will be put at risk when this measure eliminates every abortion health regulation on the books. In a state where 25% of abortion centers failed inspections it’s no surprise they want to be completely unregulated to increase their profits at the expense of women, girls, and babies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Billy, VP of State Affairs for SBA Pro-Life America, told Fox News Digital that major pro-abortion groups will be pumping money into the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Planned parenthood and other abortion businesses, with support from the ACLU, are the major backers of this initiative,&quot; Billy said. &quot;And with good reason—they stand to benefit most if Florida becomes a late-term abortion destination and the state cannot enforce basic health and safety guidelines or even inspect their facilities. One thing is certain, their message won’t explain how extreme this amendment is and won’t focus on the ACLU’s new lawsuit in Ohio where they’re challenging whether an informed consent law allowed under Roe is permitted after the amendment.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pro-abortion groups have pointed out that abortion restrictions have been implemented across the entire deep south since Roe’s reversal and suggested the Florida vote will be a rallying cry against those nationwide efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, said in a statement her organization had seen the negative impact from abortion bans on patients in Florida. &quot;Today’s decision paves the way for Florida voters to stop these ridiculous abortion bans once and for all,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constitutional amendments in Florida must pass with at least 60% of the vote, a larger percentage of the vote than any statewide abortion measure has yet won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;With abortion on the ballot, Republicans in Florida have the opportunity to be resoundingly clear on where they stand on the issue of abortion and the value of all life,&quot; Florida GOP State Sen. Erin Grall told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As an issue where lives all across Florida will be deeply and dramatically affected if this were to pass, I know Republicans will be emphasizing their support of pro-life protections and communicating on this important issue with compassion, which is in contrast with the deeply unpopular Democrat agenda for unlimited abortion in Florida.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reuters contributed to this report&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>After losing his wife to colon cancer, a New York man is dedicating his life to fighting the disease and protecting others from tragedy. Fox News Digital spoke to Roy de Souza about his journey.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After losing his wife to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer/colon-cancer&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;colon cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a New York man has dedicated his life to fighting the disease and trying to protect other families from the same tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roy de Souza, now 54, and his wife, Aisha de Sequeira, had three young children when she was diagnosed with cancer in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/parenting/family&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the family&lt;/a&gt; was living in India, where de Souza ran a technology company and his wife headed up an investment banking firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/what-is-colorectal-cancer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHAT IS COLORECTAL CANCER? SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, RISKS AND MORE OF THE GLOBAL HEALTH CONCERN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We had a good life there — and then she was diagnosed,&quot; he told Fox News Digital in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She was only in her mid-40s.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His wife’s first symptom was stomach pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple trips to the doctor yielded nothing, but the pain continued. Finally, a CT scan revealed the shadows of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Colon cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a tricky one, because it&apos;s inside the body — you can’t see it,&quot; de Souza said. &quot;It’s a complicated disease.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family immediately flew to New York, where de Sequeira had surgery and started chemotherapy treatments at Sloan Kettering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/doctors-told-woman-young-colonoscopy-diagnosed-stage-3-colon-cancer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DOCTORS TOLD WOMAN SHE WAS TOO YOUNG FOR A COLONOSCOPY. THEN SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE 3 COLON CANCER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although de Souza was optimistic at first, the doctors told him that they would not be able to cure his wife, as the cancer had metastasized (spread) throughout her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal was to prolong her life as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Surgery only works if the cancer has not spread or has not spread too much,&quot; de Souza said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frustrated by the lack of options, de Souza immersed himself in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/cancer-research&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;cancer research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My personality is, when I see something broken, I want to fix it,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/medications&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Traditional treatments&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; use the same approach for every patient, he noted — but they’re not effective for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That’s because cancer is different in each patient,&quot; de Souza told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The disease is like a tree — there are different branches, and one drug might kill some of those branches, but not all of them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, &quot;I researched all the different options, talked to all the doctors and experts, and decided to create a software to analyze patients’ cancer cells and find the different ‘branches.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leveraging his technology background, de Souza started a company called BreakBio, which aims to develop personalized, targeted therapies geared to each patient’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personalization is particularly important for cancer, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t think you need to personalize all drugs in the world — but for cancer, it’s different from transmissible diseases,&quot; he said. &quot;It didn&apos;t come from someone else. It grew within you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted BreakBio approval to start clinical trials for its colorectal therapy later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as de Souza’s wife underwent cancer treatment, she was fully supportive of his efforts to launch BreakBio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She wanted to be optimistic,&quot; he said. &quot;She said, ‘You take care of this disease, you talk to doctors and figure out what can be done.’ That was her way of coping.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BreakBio team got to work developing a personalized vaccine that is designed to be used along with traditional cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term &quot;vaccine&quot; can be a bit misleading, de Souza noted, as BreakBio’s therapy attacks the cancer rather than aiming to prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We often refer to it as personalized cancer immunotherapy, but unfortunately, the industry uses the word ‘vaccine,’ which can be confusing,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/breast-ovarian-cancer-treatment-options&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BREAST, OVARIAN AND OTHER TYPES OF CANCERS WITH THE MOST TREATMENT OPTIONS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software uses machine learning, a type of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/artificial-intelligence&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to analyze the outside of the cancer cells, identifying proteins called peptides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The machine learning then starts to learn about what kind of peptides are on the outside of the cancer cells, creating patterns for each patient,&quot; de Souza said. &quot;You have to repeat that for every patient, because the cancer-related proteins are different for each one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The personalized vaccine then &quot;trains&quot; the body to create T cells, which are white blood cells that help to fight infection and attack cancer targets, de Souza said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, de Souza’s wife began receiving some of BreakBio’s therapies in Germany, where the laws were more conducive to experimental treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hit in March 2020, they were no longer able to travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/colorectal-cancer-leading-cause-death-among-young-adults-cancer-report&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;COLORECTAL CANCER IS NOW LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG YOUNG ADULTS WITH CANCER: NEW REPORT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She started going downhill, and I realized how much the drugs had been keeping her going,&quot; said de Souza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His wife ultimately lost her battle with cancer in Dec. 2020 — but that didn’t stop de Souza from continuing his own fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside experts — including Dr. Avital Gaziel, co-founder and chief science officer of Leal Health, a Connecticut-based cancer treatment company — see promise in personalized cancer vaccines like the ones BioBreak is developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Personalized cancer vaccines are a promising and rapidly evolving type of immunotherapy,&quot; Gaziel told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations and challenges associated with these types of therapies, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tumors are often a mixed bag of cells with varying alterations,&quot; he said. &quot;Since the personalized vaccine targets specific entities coming from the patient&apos;s own tumor, the immune response might not be strong enough to eliminate the entire tumor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may also be manufacturing challenges, Gaziel noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Creating personalized vaccines is a complex process that requires analyzing the patient&apos;s tumor and tailoring the vaccine accordingly,&quot; he said. &quot;The process is expensive and time-consuming, potentially delaying treatment or making it inaccessible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, some patients may not be candidates for personalized vaccines, depending on the stage and type of their cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaziel is optimistic, though, about the potential of AI-based personalized vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;AI is revolutionizing the design of cancer vaccines, offering a faster, more targeted approach that is solving or mitigating some of the above-mentioned barriers,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a patient&apos;s specific tumor attributes, AI can design a vaccine tailored to that person&apos;s unique cancer profile, which may lead to more effective vaccines with fewer side effects, Gaziel added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/ai-model-could-help-predict-lung-cancer-risks-non-smokers-study-finds-significant-advancement&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI MODEL COULD HELP PREDICT LUNG CANCER RISKS IN NON-SMOKERS, STUDY FINDS: ‘SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENT’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also some limitations of the AI, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Training effective AI models requires a large amount of data [for] all of the parameters that impact success,&quot; he told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Also, it is not always easy to understand how AI models arrive at their predictions. This is crucial for ensuring their accuracy and reliability.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BreakBio’s initial focus is on colorectal cancer — the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and the fourth leading cause in women, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s an area of urgent medical need, in my opinion,&quot; said de Souza. &quot;Colon cancer is hitting patients earlier and earlier, and it&apos;s not getting solved.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan is to eventually apply the technology to many other types of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although de Souza’s journey was sparked by tragedy, he said the experience has been fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For me, it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something that really makes a difference and changes things,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If I can get this done, it will be a huge achievement for me personally.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that he hopes &quot;it will work for many people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, de Souza said he is optimistic about the progress being made — particularly with the advent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/medical-tech&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI-based approaches&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now we have these computer systems that are analyzing and coming up with answers — and that&apos;s critical for these personalized therapies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told Fox News Digital, &quot;I think technologies have evolved to a point where we can spot and understand the problem, which means the chances of solving it are much higher.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews/health&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Mario&amp;apos;s Meat Market and Gourmet Deli in Queens is selling a new kind of hero sandwich to support fallen officer Jonathan Diller&amp;apos;s family.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; deli has begun selling a new hero sandwich called &quot;The NYPD&quot; to help raise money for the family of officer Jonathan Diller after he was shot and killed on duty last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe DiGangi, owner of Mario&apos;s Meat Market and Gourmet Deli in Queens, said the public response has been &quot;great&quot; as he hopes to raise upwards of $40,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s not just local people coming in and buying the hero. It&apos;s also people from all around the country calling in, paying for the hero, telling us any law enforcement that comes in to shop, just give them lunch for free on us,&quot; he said Tuesday on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Fox &amp;amp; Friends First.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/wife-slain-nypd-officer-jonathan-diller-delivers-emotional-eulogy-thousands-attend-funeral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WIFE OF SLAIN NYPD OFFICER JONATHAN DILLER DELIVERS EMOTIONAL EULOGY AS THOUSANDS ATTEND FUNERAL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five dollars from the sale of every &quot;NYPD&quot; sandwich – made with&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;chicken cutlet, prosciutto, mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes and arugula drizzled with balsamic glaze – will go to Diller&apos;s widow Stephanie and his nearly one-year-old son Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sandwich&apos;s release was announced Monday, according to The New York Post, with Councilman Robert Holden, D-Queens, and DiGangi holding a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holden, who attended Diller&apos;s funeral on Saturday, said he was in tears and praised DiGangi for doing something to make a difference. He said others in his district want to do their part to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mets-pay-tribute-slain-nypd-officer-jonathan-diller-opening-day&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;METS PAY TRIBUTE TO SLAIN NYPD OFFICER JONATHAN DILLER ON OPENING DAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We want to help police,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DiGangi had hoped to keep the effort to assist the family &quot;under the radar&quot; but said the gesture took off on social media over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It does [make me feel good],&quot; DiGangi said. &quot;You know what? It&apos;s not going to bring her husband and that little baby&apos;s dad back, but maybe a little peace of mind to get through life here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/o/2zmYh/https://www.foxnews.com/us/jonathan-diller-shooting-nypd-sergeants-union-tells-anti-police-democrats-stay-away-funeral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Diller was killed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during a traffic stop in Queens after a man with 21 prior arrests allegedly shot him in the stomach as he was trying to make him exit the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DiGangi said the tragedy has hit close to home as a father of two young boys himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Crime in the city has just gotten out of control and somebody really has to do something about it,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-attends-slain-nypd-officer-jonathan-dillers-wake&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP ATTENDS SLAIN NYPD OFFICER JONATHAN DILLER&apos;S WAKE: ‘NEED LAW AND ORDER’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diller was laid to rest on Long Island over the weekend, his loss spawning a series of tributes that reminded the public of the sacrifices law enforcement officers risk daily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former President Donald Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6349938096112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;paid his respects&lt;/a&gt; to the slain officer last week, attending his wake on Thursday. The New York Mets also paid tribute to Diller during their home opener against the Milwaukee Brewers on Friday, pausing for a moment of silence while players from both teams lined up along the baselines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A visual tribute to Diller was shown on the Jumbotron at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Citi Field&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Queens.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>RFK Jr. reaffirms he would pardon Edward Snowden on first day of his presidency</title>
                    
                    <description>Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he will pardon NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden on his first day as president if he is elected.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he remains committed to pardoning NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden on his first day in office if he is elected to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy Jr. released a petition Monday calling on President Biden to pardon Snowden, who in 2013 famously visited Hong Kong and exposed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/national-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;classified NSA documents&lt;/a&gt; that revealed the U.S. government was spying on its citizens. He was then charged with espionage and theft of government property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Snowden performed a critical public service by revealing to Americans for the first time that our government had been spying on us, millions of law-abiding American citizens, in violation of numerous laws and of our fundamental right to privacy,&quot; Kennedy Jr. said in a video attached to the petition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a Russian citizen after seeking asylum, Snowden was stranded in Russia following the release of the documents after the U.S. government revoked his passport as he was attempting to make the trip to his intended final destination of Latin America, where he had planned to stay to avoid U.S. prosecution for taking thousands of classified documents from the NSA and leaking them to the press. Snowden has not left Russia since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-citizenship-stability-family-snowden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUSSIAN CITIZENSHIP PROVIDES &apos;A LITTLE STABILITY&apos; FOR HIM AND HIS FAMILY, SNOWDEN SAYS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information included the mass collection of Americans&apos; metadata, allowing the government to see when and to whom a phone call or message was sent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video also featured a compilation of comments made by former Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump, all of whom criticized Snowden as a traitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Prior to Edward Snowden, nobody knew that the intelligence agencies were illegally mining all of our data and spying on American citizens,&quot; Kennedy Jr. said. &quot;So it&apos;s not surprising that those same intelligence agencies are now trying to portray Snowden as a criminal and that captive politicians are supporting that narrative.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Edward Snowden is an American hero,&quot; Kennedy Jr. continued. &quot;Instead of jailing Snowden, I&apos;m going to build a statue to him and maybe to [WikiLeaks founder] Julian Assange somewhere near the Washington Press Club or perhaps outside the CIA headquarters in Langley as a civics lesson to the Republic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/edward-snowden-obama-surveillance-worse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;EDWARD SNOWDEN SAYS BARACK OBAMA MADE SURVEILLANCE STATE &apos;WORSE&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidential hopeful has previously said he would pardon Snowden and Assange, an Australian publisher held in a maximum security London prison and fighting extradition to the U.S. on espionage charges for publishing classified military documents in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s time that we return our government to the democratic and humanitarian ideals that we&apos;ve always represented as a nation,&quot; Kennedy Jr. said. &quot;Let&apos;s go back to championing free speech and celebrating truth-tellers and the whistleblowers who put their careers and their own freedom on the line to protect ours.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy Jr. has long been a critic of the U.S. intelligence agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After initially challenging Biden for the Democratic Party&apos;s presidential nomination, Kennedy Jr. launched a White House bid as an independent in October, setting up a match-up against Biden and Trump in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2024 general election&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has previously said he believes Snowden is a &quot;total traitor&quot; and even suggested once that the whistleblower &quot;should be executed.&quot; Still, the former president later admitted he considered pardoning Snowden or Assange, who was indicted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trump&apos;s Justice Department&lt;/a&gt;, in the final days of his administration, although he did not specify which one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The America I love doesn’t punish whistleblowers,&quot; Kenndy Jr. wrote in his petition. &quot;Truth-tellers who champion free speech and try to return America to its democratic and humanitarian ideals should be revered, not prosecuted.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>The iconic Tropicana Hotel on the Las Vegas strip will close its doors to make way for a new $1.5 billion Major League Baseball stadium.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/las-vegas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;of Las Vegas&apos;&lt;/a&gt; longest-standing and most historic hotels is shuttering its doors after nearly 67 years to make room for a new Major League Baseball stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tropicana Las Vegas closed on Tuesday, just shy of its 67th. anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demolition is slated for October to make room for a $1.5 billion Major League Baseball stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hotel, which opened on the iconic Las Vegas strip on April 4, 1957, was nicknamed the &quot;Tiffany of the Strip&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/travel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;for its opulence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/pinball-hall-fame-offers-25-cent-family-fun-las-vegas-strip-donated-charity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PINBALL HALL OF FAMES OFFERS 25-CENT FAMILY FUN ON THE LAS VEGAS STRIP, DONATED $1.2M TO CHARITY IN 2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it was built in the late -1950s, the Tropicana cost $15 million to build. It was three stories with 300 rooms split into two wings, creating a footprint shaped like the letter &quot;Y.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, the Tropicana underwent two major hotel expansions: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/travel-tips&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Tiffany Tower&lt;/a&gt; opened in 1979 with 600 rooms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was renamed the Paradise Tower. In 1986, the Island Tower opened with 800 rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes at the opulent Tropicana opening, the hotel had close ties &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/sean-diddy-combs-sons-hire-mob-lawyer-mother-blasts-feds-releasing-video-mansion-raid&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;with famed mobster&lt;/a&gt; Frank Costello. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks after Tropicana debuted, Costello was shot in the head in New York. He survived, but police found in his coat pocket a piece of paper with the Tropicana’s exact earnings figure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The note also mentioned &quot;money to be skimmed&quot; for Costello’s associates, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://themobmuseum.org/blog/tropicana/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;a post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on The Mob Museum’s website looking back on the Tropicana’s storied past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/remains-lost-alaskans-sent-oregon-mental-hospital-century-ago-recovered-returned-home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REMAINS OF ‘LOST ALASKANS’ SENT TO OREGON MENTAL HOSPITAL A CENTURY AGO ARE RECOVERED, RETURNED HOME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the 1970s, federal authorities investigating mobsters &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/kansas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Kansas City&lt;/a&gt; would charge more than a dozen mob operatives with conspiring to skim nearly $2 million in gambling revenue from Las Vegas casinos, including the Tropicana. Charges connected to the Tropicana alone resulted in five convictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1959, the Tropicana debuted a risqué show which featured topless feathered showgirls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cabaret was featured in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/elvis-presley-rock-and-roll&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;1964 Elvis Presley&lt;/a&gt; film &quot;Viva Las Vegas.&quot; Magicians Siegfried Fischbacher and Roy Horn got their start in the show, as did Lance Burton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A portion of &quot;The Godfather&quot; was filmed at the Tropicana and in the 1971 film &quot;Diamonds Are Forever,&quot; James Bond stays there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I hear that the Hotel Tropicana is quite comfortable,&quot; Bond said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>GREG GUTFELD: Florida&apos;s the Sunshine State, not the Pitch-Black Dark State</title>
                    
                    <description>&amp;quot;Gutfeld!&amp;quot; panelists discuss an NBC News story on Floridians moving out of the Sunshine State, but they point out it could be lacking in some key details.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/fareed-zakaria-calls-stacey-abrams-election-denier-debate-ronna-mcdaniels-firing-nbc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;, which stands for Nothing But Crap, published a story titled, &quot;They came for Florida&apos;s sun and sand. They got soaring costs and a culture war.&quot; And it&apos;s a masterpiece of cherry-picking — or orange-picking, since it is Florida — which means it&apos;s time for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GUTFELD! SONG:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt; Reporters are coming around, and Dem narratives is what they demand. So they&apos;ll twist on the facts, &apos;cause in the media that&apos;s the plan. To only tell half of the story with data they pick and they choose. A desperate attempt to make dollars and cents by lying to viewers like you on the news.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mentally ill. As we all know, since the pandemic, people are flocking to Florida like Lizzo to a food truck. But did you know that not everybody is glad they did, says NBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While hundreds of thousands of new residents have flocked to the state on the promise of beautiful weather, no income tax and lower costs, nearly 500,000 left in 2022... contributing to their move was a perfect storm of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/3-florida-residents-file-lawsuit-alleging-inadequate-notification-health-insurance-termination&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;soaring insurance&lt;/a&gt;, a hostile political environment, worsening traffic and extreme weather.&quot; They got all that from interviewing 12 people. Yeah, 12 people who left the state in the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sadly, the writer also had to admit that Florida is the second-fastest-growing state as of July 2023, meaning that many more moved in than actually moved out. So as Stephen Green at PJ Media says about this dopey piece, &quot;It&apos;s like claiming that a restaurant is losing customers by only counting the people who have paid their checks and walked out the door.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, that would kill any story about a so-called exodus, but it didn&apos;t. Instead, NBC found a few people to tell their sob stories. One woman who moved to Florida from Connecticut in 2021 complained she didn&apos;t know it would be &quot;100 degrees at night.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-water-topped-100-degrees-twice-week-set-world-record-hot-tub&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLORIDA WATER TOPPED 100-DEGREES TWICE THIS WEEK, MAY HAVE SET WORLD RECORD: ‘THIS IS A HOT TUB’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, when is 100 degrees not the perfect sleeping temperature for women? &quot;Oh, I&apos;m so cold.&quot; That should be on the epitaph, on the tombstone of every woman who ever lived. But that&apos;s right. She didn&apos;t know it&apos;d be so hot in Florida. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, you think the motto on their license plates would have tipped her off? It&apos;s the Sunshine State, not the Pitch-Black Dark State, you dips***. It&apos;s why part of the state is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-faces-extreme-heat-water-temperatures-soar-sahara-dust-clouds-loom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;called the Panhandle&lt;/a&gt;, and where anybody living there over the age of 30 has more facial wrinkles than a shar pei&apos;s balls dipped in ice water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, did you know that there&apos;s a lot of traffic? Who knew that other than everybody? I got news for you, lady. When the age of the average driver is 84 on any road in America, there&apos;s going to be congestion. See, when she moved to Florida, she didn&apos;t realize it would be Florida. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She&apos;s like that easily offended comedy club audience member who didn&apos;t read up on the headliner, and is mad that the comedian&apos;s sense of humor doesn&apos;t mirror her own, so she walks out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBC News also cites consumer prices and insurance rates. Imagine that! A place that&apos;s becoming more popular is also becoming more expensive. Meanwhile, in California, you can Airbnb the Oakland Coliseum for $85 bucks a night. And did you know that if you live in Florida, your home might be damaged by a hurricane? Why didn&apos;t someone tell these people Florida has hurricanes? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If only Florida&apos;s sports teams gave us a hint, right? Oh, yeah. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/miami-hurricanes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Miami Hurricanes&lt;/a&gt; field 16 teams. Baseball, basketball, football, even women&apos;s soccer — and that&apos;s not even real. One guy said he felt unsafe because everyone walks around with guns there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, dear God, Florida likes guns. Well, you would, too, if you were sandwiched between Haiti and Georgia. Hasn&apos;t this dude ever seen an episode of &quot;Cops&quot;? You think it&apos;s a coincidence every other episode was shot in Broward County? I just hear that name and I start flushing drugs down the toilet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBC News also reports Floridians are fleeing the state over its &quot;increasingly conservative policies,&quot; including a &quot;crackdown on undocumented immigrants, a ban on transgender care for minors, state interventions in how race, slavery and sexuality are taught in schools… &quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, more laws are enforced, children aren&apos;t sterilized for playing with the wrong toys, and people don&apos;t assume you&apos;re racist for being White. Meaning the only people fleeing are liberal dips**** who didn&apos;t belong there in the first place. Fleeing the state is just another way of expressing all that tolerance they&apos;re known for, and so they should go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/florida-sets-shining-example-school-choice-heres-how&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLORIDA SETS SHINING EXAMPLE ON SCHOOL CHOICE. HERE&apos;S HOW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So NBC found a dozen people, literally 12, who moved to Florida with unrealistic expectations and now regret it. Hell, I could find 12 people who say Seth Meyers is funny — you know, if I asked his writers. But hey, Florida is doing great thanks to Gov. DeSantis, so NBC News feels duty-bound to treat it like a San Francisco sidewalk and take a dump on it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/police-sink-suspected-san-francisco-bay-bandits-after-seafaring-pirates-terrorize-houseboats-yachts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;speaking of San Fran&lt;/a&gt;, a new report from WalletHub ranks it as the healthiest city in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True, dodging street turds is great cardio, and open-air drug use must be great for the lungs. Nice work, WalletHub — managing to overlook minor things like crime, homelessness and the overdose epidemic. What the hell is WalletHub? Well, it&apos;s a finance company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where is it headquartered? Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fact is, no lib who wants to remain in good standing can say anything bad about a Democrat-caused nightmare or anything good about Republican success, but even Democrats don&apos;t really believe this. Just ask AOC and Gretchen Whitmer when they&apos;re vacationing in Florida. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Fox News host Sean Hannity says &amp;quot;thousands of would-be illegal immigrants have died during the perilous journey across the border.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News host Sean Hannity lays out just how much suffering the southern border crisis is inflicting upon Americans and migrants alike on &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hannity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEAN HANNITY: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Under Biden, we all know thousands of would-be illegal immigrants have died during the perilous journey across our border. Thousands more are facing extreme suffering imposed by human traffickers, drug cartels, but on the American side of the border, this bloodbath is reaching every single corner of our country.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/shakira-shreds-barbie-movie-saying-emasculating-sons-absolutely-hated&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SHAKIRA SHREDS &apos;BARBIE&apos; MOVIE, SAYING IT WAS &apos;EMASCULATING&apos; FOR HER SONS: &apos;ABSOLUTELY HATED IT&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;President Trump was speaking in Grand Rapids, Mich. That is where an &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/indiana-gop-hopeful-scarred-sons-fentanyl-death-calls-border-action-apathy-opposite-love&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;illegal immigrant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; recently murdered a young woman, dumped her body on the side of a road. The alleged perpetrator was deported under Donald Trump, likely re-entered the country under Joe Biden&apos;s open borders. Meanwhile, in Boston, Mass., an illegal immigrant from Guatemala was just arrested on more than a dozen sex crimes against children, including rape. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In New York City, eight &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/heres-how-homeowners-fight-against-squatter-insanity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;illegal immigrants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; from Venezuela are suspected of squatting in a Bronx basement. They were just apprehended on a variety of charges after police found multiple firearms with extended magazines, plenty of ammo, a large quantity of drugs — including ketamine mixed with cocaine — along with a 7-year-old child. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mike Tyson has accomplished just about everything a boxer could in the sport - his next opponent in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jake-paul&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jake Paul&lt;/a&gt; has just 10 professional bouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyson is in the conversation as the best boxer of all-time - on the contrary, while Paul has his eyes set on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/boxing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;becoming a world champion&lt;/a&gt;, he certainly has a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the butterflies are alive and well, even for the &quot;Baddest Man On The Planet,&quot; who admits he is &quot;scared to death&quot; about his fight with the former YouTuber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have a weird personality - I don&apos;t think it&apos;s weird though. Whatever I&apos;m afraid to do, I do it. That&apos;s how it is,&quot; Tyson told Sean Hannity on Tuesday night. &quot;I was afraid of the Roy [Jones Jr. fight [in 2020]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was 100 pounds overweight, I was however old, 54, 53, and I said ‘Let’s do it.&apos; Anything I&apos;m afraid of, I confront it. That&apos;s my personality. Right now, I&apos;m scared to death.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that&apos;s what pushes Tyson to get back in the ring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I always believed that adversity and nervousness pretty much catapulted me into success. If I didn&apos;t have these feelings, I wouldn&apos;t go into this fight. I have to have these feelings to fight. Without them, I would never go in the ring.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ex-ufc-star-mike-tysons-training-video-jake-paul-fight-illegitimate&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EX-UFC STAR SAYS MIKE TYSON&apos;S TRAINING VIDEO FOR JAKE PAUL FIGHT IS ILLEGITIMATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when &quot;reality&quot; sets in, Tyson will be all business, and the butterflies will float away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As the fight gets closer, the less nervous I become, because it&apos;s reality. And in reality, I&apos;m invincible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyson says Paul has come &quot;a long way from YouTubing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I saw a YouTube of him at 16 doing weird dances. That&apos;s not the guy I&apos;m gonna be fighting,&quot; he said. &quot;This guy is gonna come, he&apos;s gonna try to hurt me, which I&apos;m accustomed to, and he&apos;s gonna be greatly mistaken.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fight will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/boxing-legend-mike-tyson-face-off-against-jake-paul-july-bout-i-plan-finish-him&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;take place at AT&amp;amp;T Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the Dallas Cowboys, on July 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>JESSE WATTERS: Biden&apos;s &apos;bloodbath&apos; at the border is seeping into the swing state suburbs</title>
                    
                    <description>Fox News host Jesse Watters lays out how the &amp;apos;bloodbath&amp;apos; hoax began and how former President Trump is now using the term on &amp;apos;Jesse Watters Primetime.&amp;apos;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News host Jesse Watters explains how former President Trump flipped the script on the media in his opening monologue Tuesday on &quot;Jesse Watters Primetime.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JESSE WATTERS:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;i&gt;Whenever Trump said fake news, the media wailed, which meant it worked. Since they&apos;re all talk, no action, Democrats know the power of words. Last month, Trump said &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-abc-vigorously-defend-trump-bloodbath-coverage-did-not-miss-full-context&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;there&apos;d be a &quot;bloodbath&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; in the auto industry from China dumping cheap cars through Mexico behind Biden&apos;s back. And suddenly the &quot;bloodbath&quot; hoax was born. And just like last time, Trump flipped it and branded them with it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Today, the former president in Michigan at an event he called &quot;Biden&apos;s border bloodbath.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Twenty-five-year-old &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/previously-deported-illegal-immigrant-charged-murder-25-year-old-michigan-woman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ruby Garcia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; was found riddled with bullet holes on the side of a freeway. An illegal alien killer let in by Biden. And just like Laken Riley, the White House was caught flat-footed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-spotlights-bidens-border-bloodbath-during-stop-crucial-battleground-state-he-lost-2020&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP SPOTLIGHTS ‘BIDEN’S BORDER BLOODBATH&apos; DURING STOP IN CRUCIAL BATTLEGROUND STATE HE LOST IN 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Biden&apos;s &quot;bloodbath&quot; at &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-vote-with-republicans-condemn-biden-immigration-policies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;the border&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; is seeping into the swing state suburbs, and his team&apos;s clueless. Trump actually deported the illegal, but Biden let him back in to kill Ruby. Trump&apos;s platform? Clean up Biden&apos;s &quot;bloodbath.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;While Trump tries to stop the Biden &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-campaign-slams-trump-political-violence-warning-bloodbath-discussing-auto-industry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;bloodbath,&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; the media says Trump will create an imaginary one.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;These people have a blood fetish. They have to fantasize about future Trump bloodbaths because they can&apos;t face the Biden bloodbath today. They&apos;re disassociating themselves from reality to avoid accountability and brainwash their voters. They&apos;ve OD&apos;d on the Kool-Aid so badly they believe their own hoaxes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Former President Trump promised to stand with law enforcement and &amp;quot;restore law and order&amp;quot; following the recent death of NYPD Officer Jonathan Diller.</description>

You read about it, who was gunned down by a vicious thug, who was originally arrested by different law enforcement agencies over twenty-one times for very serious crimes. And the person with them was a known killer,&quot; Trump said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/integrity-ny-legal-system-stake-trump-appeals-civil-fraud-case-jonathan-turley-says&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘INTEGRITY’ OF NY LEGAL SYSTEM AT STAKE AS TRUMP APPEALS CIVIL FRAUD CASE, JONATHAN TURLEY SAYS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When I&apos;m re-elected I will crack down on the left-wing jurisdictions that refuse to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;prosecute dangerous criminals,&lt;/a&gt;&quot; Trump vowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/jonathan-diller-shooting-nypd-sergeants-union-tells-anti-police-democrats-stay-away-funeral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Diller was fatally shot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week during a traffic stop in Queens after a man with 21 prior arrests allegedly shot him in the stomach as Diller was trying to make the suspect — 34-year-old Guy Rivera — exit the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivera allegedly opened fire on Diller and his partner at about 5:45 p.m. The officers had approached the vehicle because it had been illegally parked at a bus stop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another man who was in the vehicle at the time of Diller&apos;s death, Lindy Jones, was also charged following the death, including for criminal possession of a weapon and defacing a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Timothy Nerozzi contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>The federal raid on one of Diddy&amp;apos;s mansions was revealed on home security footage, and an ex reveals Diddy&amp;apos;s sons have hired a former El Chapo lawyer to probe feds&amp;apos; use of force.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dramatic home surveillance video from one of Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs&apos; mansions shows federal investigators in tactical gear rushing into the luxe manor and escorting his sons out as they served one of two search warrants on the mogul&apos;s properties last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misa Hylton, Combs&apos; ex and the mother of two of his children, shared an edited video showing a portion of the raid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C5RST1NOg3Z/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;on her Instagram&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday and revealed her sons had retained the high-powered lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman, who previously represented figures who included cartel lord Joaquin &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzman and John Gotti Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Did Justin need several laser beams from firearms pointed at his chest?? Did Christian need a gun pointed at the back of his head while he was handcuffed??&quot; she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/sean-diddy-combs-probe-record-label-fires-back-after-male-music-producer-accuses-mogul-sex-assault&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEAN &apos;DIDDY&apos; COMBS PROBE: RECORD LABEL FIRES BACK AFTER MALE MUSIC PRODUCER ACCUSES MOGUL OF SEX ASSAULT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/el-chapo-lawyer-defends-disgraced-doctor-against-manslaughter-charge-gas-assisted-suicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Lichtman would&lt;/a&gt; be investigating the use of force in the raid, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The over zealous and overtly militarized force used against my sons Justin and Christian is deplorable,&quot; Hylton wrote. &quot;If these were the sons of a non-Black celebrity, they would not have been handled with the same aggression.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The edited video shows armored vehicles carrying officers in tactical gear arriving at the home and entering the compound. One officer can be seen knocking a surveillance camera off of its mount. Others swarm inside, detaining individuals, two of whom Hylton identified as the sons she shares with Combs, Justin and Christian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derrick Parker, a former member of the NYPD&apos;s rap intelligence unit, said allegations in recent civil suits referenced gun possession and narcotics, prompting federal agents to take protective measures when raiding Combs&apos; properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Once they had information that there were probably weapons in the house, and the drugs, that had to be careful,&quot; he told Fox News on Friday. &quot;They mounted a SWAT team to go in and take care of that safely.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hylton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My son&apos;s Attorney Jeffrey Lichtman is investigating the excessive use of force which was unnecessary and certainly not required by this search warrant,&quot; Hylton added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combs&apos; team declined to comment on the Instagram post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-accused-male-music-producer-sexual-assault&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEAN ‘DIDDY’ COMBS ACCUSED BY MALE MUSIC PRODUCER OF SEXUAL ASSAULT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The raid came as part of a federal sex-trafficking probe into Combs, who has denied similar allegations in a series of recent lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lichtman did not immediately return calls or emails seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/sean-diddy-combs-cant-settle-feds-sex-trafficking-probe-former-fbi-agent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEAN ‘DIDDY’ COMBS CAN&apos;T ‘SETTLE’ WITH FEDS AMID SEX TRAFFICKING PROBE: FORMER FBI AGENT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he &quot;liked&quot; Hylton&apos;s post of the video and in a post of his own, he confirmed that he would be representing at least one of Combs&apos; sons and called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;search warrants&lt;/a&gt; &quot;over the top.&quot; At time of publication, it had been viewed almost 600,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The government rarely fights fair when they have a major target in its sights, and they certainly haven’t played fair in Diddy’s case thus far,&quot; he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rapper-sean-diddy-combs-homes-raided-homeland-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;RAPPER SEAN &apos;DIDDY&apos; COMBS&apos; HOMES RAIDED BY HOMELAND SECURITY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combs&apos; ex-girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, better known as the R&amp;amp;B singer Cassie, sued him in November, alleging rape and other abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-settles-lawsuit-one-day-after-ex-girlfriend-cassies-allegations-years-rape&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;settled a day later&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; without the billionaire Combs admitting wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, since then, at least four other accusers filed lawsuits against the billionaire, including three women and a male music producer, Lil Rod, whose real name is Rodney Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the federal investigation, Combs has not been charged with a crime and denied all accusations of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has characterized the accusations as an attempt at collecting cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lil Rod (Rodney Jones) is nothing more than a liar who filed a $30 million lawsuit shamelessly looking for an undeserved payday,&quot; Combs&apos; lawyer, Shawn Holley, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-lawsuit-names-50-cents-ex-girlfriend-one-music-moguls-alleged-sex-workers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;previously told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Fox News Digital. &quot;His reckless name-dropping about events that are pure fiction and simply did not happen is nothing more than a transparent attempt to garner headlines.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homeland Security investigations did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Texas mom gets warrant issued for her arrest over late library books: &apos;Just bonkers&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>A Texas mom of five, Kaylee Morgan, told Fox News Digital that she recently learned about a late book-related warrant in her name after she was unable to renew her driver&amp;apos;s license.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A mother of five in Texas recently found herself in hot water after learning that she could go to jail over library books that her county claims were never returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaylee Morgan took out books about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/arts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Vincent van Gogh&lt;/a&gt; from Navasota Public Library in Grimes County, Texas, in March 2023. She told Fox News Digital that she did actually return all the books that she borrowed — but that one was too big to fit in a returns box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court documents obtained by Fox News Digital show that the combined value of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/books&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;two books&lt;/a&gt; was $60, but Morgan was slapped with a bill of $569.50 – mostly fines and court fees. She was also charged with a city ordinance violation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/man-vermont-finds-library-book-due-1962-nowhere-return-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAN IN VERMONT FINDS LIBRARY BOOK THAT WAS DUE IN 1962, BUT HAS NOWHERE TO RETURN IT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Warrant is ACTIVE for Your Arrest,&quot; an alarming document read. &quot;Act Now to Avoid Going to Jail.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Morgan was unaware that the months-old documents existed until recently. The mom said that the issues began when she went through the innocent task of renewing her driver&apos;s license last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So I go in and the DMV tells me that they cannot renew my license because I have a warrant out for my arrest, and I audibly laugh,&quot; she said in a video posted to Facebook. &quot;And I&apos;m shocked because I haven&apos;t been pulled over, haven&apos;t got any tickets. It just doesn&apos;t make sense.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I mostly stay home. I homeschool my kids, so it just didn&apos;t compute, what she was saying.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan then called the local court to see what the trouble was – and was told that she had two past-due library books. The stressed-out mother then scheduled an appointment with the judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s so silly. So silly. I have a warrant out for my arrest for past due library books. OK … this is not fake. This is not made up,&quot; she said, bewildered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;READ THE COURT DOCUMENTS HERE:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her meeting with the county judge, Morgan explained that she &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;homeschools her five children&lt;/a&gt; and had a difficult pregnancy around the time the books were due.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/pink-floyd-cd-returns-maryland-library-35-years-late&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PINK FLOYD&apos;S &apos;WISH YOU WERE HERE&apos; CD RETURNS TO MARYLAND LIBRARY 35 YEARS LATE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[In the meeting] I&apos;m explaining that we returned the books,&quot; she said. &quot;There was one that was too big to fit into the return box. And when we did return it, the system was down, but I definitely returned it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And that, max, was two weeks late,&quot; Morgan added. &quot;Maybe more than that, but I was pregnant and having some complications, and I was on bed rest.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge&apos;s response was less than sympathetic, Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She told me she didn&apos;t want to hear my excuses, that I needed to take responsibility,&quot; Morgan recalled. &quot;She said, what I have done by not returning the library books is the same as stealing from Walmart.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/clint-eastwoods-biography-returned-library-38-years-late-mystery-borrower-avoids-6k-fees&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLINT EASTWOOD BIOGRAPHY RETURNED TO LIBRARY 38 YEARS LATE, MYSTERY BORROWER AVOIDS $6K IN FEES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added, &quot;So on my record it says that I have stolen government property. Bonkers, right? Just bonkers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge added that the warrant still stands, and that Morgan will not be allowed to renew her driver&apos;s license before she pays the $600 ticket – a hefty sum for a single-income family of five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She said, make no mistake that if you&apos;re driving in Grimes County with or without your kids, and you get pulled over, we will arrest you. So they will arrest me in front of my kids… I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m going to do about this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan says she was technically was not served a warrant, because she was completely unaware of its existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[The judge] said they issued the warrant, and somebody signed for it, and I said it wasn&apos;t me, she said. &quot;I didn&apos;t sign for it. I would know if I had signed her warrant because I would not be driving. I don&apos;t want to go to jail. And I asked her who signed it, and she said, &apos;It doesn&apos;t matter.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mother has raised over $1,300 through GoFundMe, which has helped pay off the fines. Now she plans to hire a lawyer and get the whole mess removed from her record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan told Fox News Digital that she has received a lot of support over the situation, and hasn&apos;t heard back from authorities since she publicized the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The response from the community is mostly overwhelmingly positive,&quot; she said. &quot;There are a few who don’t understand that I DID turn the book in and others who think I’m doing a smear campaign.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the Navasota County judge, the Grimes County judge and the city manager for Navasota, but has not heard back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Bronny James expected to leave USC, enter NCAA transfer portal: report</title>
                    
                    <description>Bronny James, the son of NBA superstar LeBron James, is expected to enter the NCAA transfer portal after playing his true freshman season at USC</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bronny James, the son of Los Angeles Lakers superstar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/lebron-james&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;LeBron James&lt;/a&gt;, plans to enter the NCAA&apos;s transfer portal after one season at USC, according to basketball journalist Dick Weiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James’ expected departure from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/usc-trojans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Trojans&lt;/a&gt; comes after Andy Enfield, the team’s head coach, took the same job at SMU. Enfield had been USC’s head coach 11 seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trojans finished 15-18 (8-12 in Pac-12 play) this season and didn’t earn a berth in the NCAA Tournament despite their talent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James played 25 games, earning six starts, in his true freshman season. He averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists, while shooting 36.6% from the field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James missed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;first eight games of the season&lt;/a&gt; for the Trojans after a sudden cardiac arrest in July during the team’s offseason workouts. He played with a minutes restriction once he returned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lebron-james-watching-bronny-play-usc-gives-him-anxiety&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEBRON JAMES SAYS WATCHING SON, BRONNY, PLAY AT USC GIVES HIM ‘ANXIETY’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He made his debut against Long Beach State and dropped four points with three rebounds, two assists and two steals. James also looked just like his father on a blocked shot, chasing down his opponent from behind to swat it away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expectations have been high for James since his high school days at Sierra Canyon in Los Angeles. He came out of high school a four-star recruit, and On3 had him ranked No. 25 in the country for his 2023 class. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was speculation James would declare for the NBA Draft following his freshman season if all went well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James still hasn&apos;t made his intentions known, though entering the transfer portal could point to him wanting to get a fresh start somewhere else in college. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

You know, it&apos;s going to be called Christian Visibility Day,&quot; Trump said to thunderous applause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-demands-biden-issue-apology-over-blasphemous-trans-visibility-day-easter-sunday-appalling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP DEMANDS BIDEN ISSUE APOLOGY OVER ‘BLASPHEMOUS’ TRANS VISIBILITY DAY ON EASTER SUNDAY: ‘APPALLING’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s comments came &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;after President Biden&lt;/a&gt; celebrated &quot;Transgender Day of Visibility,&quot; which is recognized March 31, and this year fell on Easter Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-slammed-social-media-announcing-transgender-day-visibility-easter-sunday&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN SLAMMED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER ANNOUNCING TRANSGENDER DAY OF VISIBILITY ON EASTER SUNDAY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden has faced backlash after his annual day to honor the transgender movement fell on Easter Sunday, one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/christianity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;most important and holiest days&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for Christians, as they celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, previously called the &quot;Trans Day of Visbility&quot; &quot;appalling and insulting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leavitt said the president&apos;s announcement is an example of the Biden administration&apos;s &quot;years-long assault on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/religion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Christian faith&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House issued a statement saying the criticism over ‘Transgender Day of Visibility’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/christianity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;coinciding with Easter&lt;/a&gt; was divisive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a Christian who celebrates Easter with family, President Biden stands for bringing people together and upholding the dignity and freedoms of every American,&quot; read the statement. &quot;Sadly, it’s unsurprising politicians are seeking to divide and weaken our country with cruel, hateful, and dishonest rhetoric. President Biden will never abuse his faith for political purposes or for profit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Pat McAfee pays emotional tribute to former teammate Vontae Davis: &apos;If you knew him, you loved him&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Former NFL punter and current ESPN star Pat McAfee fought back tears as he spoke about his old teammate Vontae Davis, who was found dead at at relative&amp;apos;s home earlier this week.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former Indianapolis Colts punter Pat McAfee took a moment to remember his late friend and teammate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/vontae-davis-two-time-nfl-pro-bowler-dead&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Vontae Davis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NFL cornerback&lt;/a&gt; was found unresponsive at a home in Florida earlier this week, Miami television station WSVN reported on Monday. Davie Police and the Broward County Medical Examiners Office responded to the scene, which authorities later said belonged to Davis&apos; grandmother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis&apos; death left his former coaches, teammates and others stunned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Monday&apos;s edition of &quot;The Pat McAfee Show,&quot; the host and his fellow former Colts&apos; teammate Darius Butler did their best to keep their emotions in check as they honored Davis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you knew him, you loved him,&quot; McAfee said. Butler added, &quot;I’ll always remember him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McAfee described Davis as &quot;good guy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Vontae was an incredibly cool dude, good guy, nice guy, upbeat guy, energetic guy,&quot; McAfee said. &quot;I think what we’ll remember him for is being an incredibly cool teammate in that locker room and being a guy that all of us enjoyed being around on a daily basis.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also encouraged viewers to make an effort to check in with their friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Literally, if you knew him, you loved him, and you enjoyed the hell out of him. And today’s been tough. It’s going to be tough, but it’s a nice perspective-putter to remind everybody to reach out to your people… I haven’t talked to him in months, and obviously I’m never going to get to do it again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So reach out to your people, tell them you appreciate them. Tell them you like them. Tell them they’re not alone… Rest in Peace Vontae. Ya done good pal… Had no clue this was coming. Nobody did.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/missing-ex-south-carolina-quarterback-found-alive-kayak-florida-gulf-fishing-trip-goes-awry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISSING EX-SOUTH CAROLINA QUARTERBACK FOUND ALIVE ON A KAYAK IN THE FLORIDA GULF AFTER FISHING TRIP GOES AWRY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bulter spent the final six seasons of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/indianapolis-colts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NFL career in Indy&lt;/a&gt; and pointed out that Davis&apos; birthday was &quot;around the corner.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thirty-five years old, birthday around the corner… He kind of lived his life to the beat of his own drum, and it’s tough when you transition out [of the NFL] you’ve got to deal with life. You go so long living the dream… then when you go into real life… it’s tough,&quot; an emotional Butler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McAfee noted that he and Butler learned of Davis&apos; death earlier in the day, but they wanted to wait until the news was made public before speaking about their former teammate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We didn’t want to be the ones, we didn’t think it was right for us to be the people that kind of informed the world that one of our former teammates and friends had passed away,&quot; McAfee said. &quot;It just felt weird, so we’ve been just been trying to distract ourselves all show. It was a tough morning.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis&apos; brother, Vernon Davis, won a Super Bowl with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/denver-broncos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Denver Broncos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Miami Dolphins drafted Davis in the first round of the 2009 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl-draft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;. He joined the Colts in 2012. He spent six seasons in Indianapolis before playing his final NFL season in 2018 with the Buffalo Bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
