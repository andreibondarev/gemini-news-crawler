                    <title>Pentagon spox on whether US will help Israeli attack on Iran: &apos;That’s a question for Israel&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh pressed by FOX News Channel&amp;apos;s Bill Hemmer on the possibility of the US helping Israel&amp;apos;s attack against Iran as the Jewish State&amp;apos;s war cabinet weighs its next move.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense/pentagon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Pentagon spokesperson&lt;/a&gt; was pressed on how the Biden administration will react if Israel responds to Iran&apos;s unprecedented direct assault on &quot;America&apos;s Newsroom&quot; on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones from its own territory at Israel on Saturday, an attack that Israel claims was largely beaten back by its sophisticated defenses and the help of allies in the region. Attention has now turned to how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/benjamin-netanyahu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWA602f3e5a-3b04-f66e-997f-f083f6de8f59&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; could choose to respond, as the Biden administration has reportedly urged Netanyahu to show restraint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Channel&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/shows/americas-newsroom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Bill Hemmer&lt;/a&gt; asked Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh about what Biden would do if Netanyahu asked for his help in an assault against Iran. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The U.S. president apparently says if &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/several-countries-come-israels-aid-stop-iran-barrage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Israel strikes back&lt;/a&gt;, it will do it alone. What does that mean?&quot; Hemmer asked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/radical-pro-palestinian-groups-increasingly-target-houses-worship-protests-alarming-trend&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&apos;RADICAL&apos; PRO-PALESTINIAN GROUPS INCREASINGLY TARGET HOUSES OF WORSHIP FOR PROTESTS IN ALARMING TREND&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singh responded, &quot;In Israel, the war cabinet is meeting today. They met yesterday. I&apos;m not aware that a decision has been made, but that is really a sovereign decision for Israel to make. The president has been very clear that we stand with Israel and their self-defense. But we really don&apos;t want to see a wider war, a wider regional conflict, and we don&apos;t seek &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/iran-humiliated-hezbollah-houthis-completely-stunned-israel-attack-failure-gen-keane&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;war with Iran&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemmer redirected Singh back to his original query. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Okay, but back to the question: Will the U.S. help Israel if and when it chooses to respond?&quot; Hemmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singh said, &quot;That is a question for Israel to answer. They haven&apos;t made a decision that I&apos;m aware of. The war cabinet is meeting now.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/pompeo-diversity-chief-espoused-antiamerican-marxist-dogma-destroy-state-department&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;POMPEO WARNS DIVERSITY CHIEF WHO ESPOUSED ANTI-AMERICAN &apos;MARXIST DOGMA&apos; WILL &apos;DESTROY THE STATE DEPARTMENT&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemmer again pressed Singh. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/rubio-accuses-biden-leaking-netanyahu-call-appease-anti-israel-activists-game-they-playing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a&gt; asked the United States for help, would we answer that call?&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look, I&apos;m just not going to get into hypotheticals or conversations that we&apos;re having in private channels. What I can tell you is what we&apos;ve reiterated publicly and privately is that we do not seek war with Iran. We do not want to see this widen out to a broader regional conflict,&quot; Singh responded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAc62b45c8-c8bc-88d3-dfe7-d56b5d11aa40&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Israeli forces&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; targeted Iranian terror proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon in a barrage of airstrikes Sunday. Those attacks were aimed at eliminating a Hezbollah weapons manufacturing facility and other targets, the IDF said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether Israel will use Iran&apos;s attack as an opportunity to target its nuclear program remains unclear, and the UN&apos;s nuclear watchdog agency, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-closed-nuclear-facilities-for-a-day-following-attack-on-israel-says-iaea-chief/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;chief Rafael Grossi&lt;/a&gt;, said, &quot;We are always concerned about this possibility.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-796936&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWA785b52fe-54ac-caee-6f01-9e0909623b37&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;report from the Jerusalem Post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an attack on Iran’s nuclear capabilities has been the subject of years of planning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s hard to conceive of a world in which Israel responds to Iran’s crossing of red lines by merely absorbing Tehran’s missile and drone strikes. It’s even harder to think of such a world in a post-October 7 Middle East,&quot; Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/how-can-israel-respond-to-irans-brazen-attack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Foundation for Defense of Democracies&lt;/a&gt; focused on Iranian security, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Michael Lee contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Sen Hawley calls on Energy Secretary Granholm to resign in heated exchange over stock trades</title>
                    
                    <description>Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., called on Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to immediately resign during a contentious exchange during a hearing on Tuesday morning.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., called on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/energy-sec-granholm-secretly-consulted-top-ccp-energy-official-spr-releases&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm&lt;/a&gt; to resign Tuesday following a heated exchange over her past financial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/josh-hawley-demands-hearing-top-biden-official-admits-false-testimony-stock-ownership&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hawley&apos;s tense back-and-forth&lt;/a&gt; with Granholm came during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing held to review the Department of Energy&apos;s 2025 budget request. The Missouri Republican excoriated the energy secretary for violating the STOCK Act and for continuing to own shares of individual companies last year despite testifying that she did not own any individual stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is outrageous that you misled us. It is outrageous that you are continuing to mislead us,&quot; Hawley remarked. &quot;This has got to change. And, frankly, you should go.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in her tenure leading the Department of Energy, it was revealed that Granholm violated the STOCK Act nine times by failing to disclose $240,000 worth of stock sales within the legally-mandated timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-rep-calls-impeachment-inquiry-biden-energy-secretary-granholm-she-lied-under-oath&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOP REP CALLS FOR IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY INTO BIDEN ENERGY SECRETARY GRANHOLM: &apos;SHE LIED, UNDER OATH&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, separately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-energy-secretary-granholm-admits-false-testimony-owning-stocks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in a June 2023 letter&lt;/a&gt; to Energy and Natural Resource Committee leadership, Granholm said she owned shares of six unnamed individual companies worth up to $120,000 and that her husband owned $2,457.89 worth of shares in Ford Motor Company at the time of her under-oath testimony before the panel months prior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the April 20, 2023, hearing, Granholm told Hawley that she was &quot;not owning individual stocks.&quot; After discovering her and her husband&apos;s ownership of stock, Granholm sold her husband&apos;s Ford shares on May 15, 2023, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/josh-hawley-presses-biden-energy-secretary-false-testimony-stock-purchases&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sold her remaining individual stock holdings&lt;/a&gt; days later, according to her letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-energy-secretary-reveals-stock-ownership-ev-lobby-group-founding-company&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN ENERGY SECRETARY REVEALS STOCK OWNERSHIP OF EV LOBBY GROUP FOUNDING COMPANY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You neglected to report it to this committee for months afterwards,&quot; Hawley asked Granholm during the hearing Tuesday. &quot;Why did you mislead this committee?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, my goodness,&quot; Granholm responded. &quot;I believed that I had sold all individual stocks and I was incorrect. So, I came back as soon as I found out that, in fact, I had not sold all individual stocks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawley then interrupted her, noting that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-republican-calls-for-inspector-general-probe-biden-energy-secretarys-stock-ownership&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;she waited a month&lt;/a&gt; before informing the committee of the transactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I did not hide it because I brought it forth to the committee when I realized that we had made a mistake,&quot; Granholm added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the GOP lawmaker also blasted Granholm for allowing agency employees to own individual stocks. Last year, The Wall Street Journal reported that hundreds of senior DOE officials own stocks related to the agency&apos;s work, a potential conflict-of-interest violation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that senior DOE officials owning stocks reveals the &quot;institutionalized corruption in the Department of Energy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granholm responded, saying officials strictly own stocks in companies in areas they do not have any influence over. She also said the agency has a strong ethics office that reviews relevant transactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>USC cancels valedictorian&apos;s graduation speech after anti-Israel social media posts, security concerns emerge</title>
                    
                    <description>A Muslim valedictorian at the University of Southern California has been barred from giving a commencement speech after anti-Israel posts came to light.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Muslim &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/california-usc-game-delayed-students-protest-professors-stalking-suspension&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;University of Southern California (USC)&lt;/a&gt; valedictorian has been barred from giving a speech at the school&apos;s graduation ceremony following a series of social media posts she allegedly made about Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the college directed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt; to information posted on the provost office website, which announced that Asna Tabassum will not deliver her speech at the ceremony that draws 65,000 people to the University Park Campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While this is disappointing, tradition must give way to safety. This decision is not only necessary to maintain the safety of our campus and students but is consistent with the fundamental legal obligation – including the expectations of federal regulators – that universities act to protect students and keep our campus community safe,&quot; Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.provost.usc.edu/important-update-on-2024-commencement/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Andrew T. Guzman wrote.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guzman also revealed he will work with faculty to reconsider how best to recognize undergraduate students&apos; achievements, noting that many large universities have stopped selecting a single valedictorian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/college-presidents-growing-spine-universities-increasingly-laying-down-law-against-antisemitism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLLEGE PRESIDENTS GROWING A SPINE? UNIVERSITIES INCREASINGLY LAYING DOWN THE LAW AGAINST ANTISEMITISM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To be clear: this decision has nothing to do with freedom of speech. There is no free-speech entitlement to speak at a commencement. The issue here is how best to maintain campus security and safety, period,&quot; he stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tabassum is a biomedical engineering major chosen from nearly 100 student applicants with GPAs equal to or greater than 3.98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-04-15/usc-valedictorian-asna-tabassum&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;The Los Angeles Times reported&lt;/a&gt; that after USC President Carol Folt announced Tabassum as valedictorian, critics took issue with her minor, &quot;Resistance to Genocide&quot;, and social media comments she made about the Israel-Hamas war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university told the outlet that threats had been made through letters, phone calls, and emails to USC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The intensity of feelings, fueled by both social media and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, has grown to include many voices outside of USC and has escalated to the point of creating substantial risks relating to security and disruption at commencement,&quot; Guzman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We Are Tov, a group dedicated to fighting antisemitism, accused Tabassum of promoting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/uc-regent-levels-campus-antisemitism-anti-muslim-hate-absolutely-disproportionate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;antisemitic writings.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/thousands-ny-voters-switch-dem-party-ahead-squad-members-primary-antisemitism-ballot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;THOUSANDS OF NY VOTERS SWITCH TO DEM PARTY AHEAD OF &apos;SQUAD&apos; MEMBER&apos;S PRIMARY: &apos;ANTISEMITISM&apos; ON BALLOT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group noted her Instagram bio linked out to a page calling Zionism a &quot;racist settler-colonial ideology.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also allegedly liked Instagram posts from &quot;Trojans for Palestine&quot; and called for the &quot;complete abolition&quot; of Israel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13312841/USC-bans-valedictorian-speech-commencement-antisemitic-posts.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;according to the Daily Mail.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her account has since been scrubbed, but screenshots of her online conduct remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council on American-Islamic Relations-Los Angeles (CAIR-LA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://ca.cair.com/losangeles/news/cair-la-demands-usc-reverse-cowardly-decision-to-cancel-muslim-valedictorians-speech-in-response-to-anti-palestinian-hate/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;has demanded&lt;/a&gt; that Tabassum be allowed to speak at the commencement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;USC cannot hide its cowardly decision behind a disingenuous concern for &apos;security.&apos; Asna is an incredibly accomplished student whose academic and extracurricular accomplishments made her the ideal and historic recipient of this year&apos;s valedictorian&apos;s honor. The university can, should, and must ensure a safe environment for graduation rather than taking the unprecedented step of canceling a valedictorian&apos;s speech,&quot; CAIR-LA Executive Director Hussam Ayloush said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tabassum also put out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cair.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/StatementbyAsna-Tabassum.pdf?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;amp;eId=a6674f0e-2da9-4c05-b200-ee12e8c8ce69&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;her own statement,&lt;/a&gt; claiming she has been subjected to a campaign of &quot;racist hatred.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am not surprised by those who attempt to propagate hatred. I am surprised that my own university—my home for four years—has abandoned me,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Jazzmine Hall, 29, of Athens, Tennessee, pleaded guilty Monday to killing four people over a custody dispute, and has been sentenced to life in prison.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Tennessee woman&lt;/a&gt; charged in the slayings of four people stemming from a custody dispute has pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jazzmine Jacole Hall, 29, of Athens, entered the plea Monday in McMinn County Criminal Court as jury selection was about to begin, news outlets reported. She had been scheduled for trial on charges &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;of murder&lt;/a&gt;, attempted murder, kidnapping and arson in the 2021 shooting deaths of Trevon Hall, Skylar Hawn, Jesse Dupree and Brandi Harris, according to court records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four were found dead at a home in Riceville stemming from an altercation over a 10-month-old child belonging to Jazzmine Hall and Trevon Hall. Two others were at the house at the time of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/mass-shootings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the shooting&lt;/a&gt;, but they survived and called police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall was sentenced to four consecutive life terms with no chance of release, District Attorney General Shari Tayloe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A co-defendant in the case is scheduled for trial in September.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Patrick Mahomes gushes about Taylor Swift, praises her interest in football</title>
                    
                    <description>Kansas City Chiefs great Patrick Mahomes raved about Taylor Swift and dismissed any notion she was a distraction to the team during its skid.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/taylor-swift&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Taylor Swift&lt;/a&gt; was as much a part of the sports world as the pop culture world in 2023, and sports fans&apos; attention to Swift continued into 2024 as the Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-travis-kelces-coachella-date-night-sees-them-getting-cozy-backstage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Swift and Travis Kelce’s&lt;/a&gt; romance blossomed last season, the &quot;Anti-Hero&quot; singer accompanying the tight end to multiple games and even bringing some of her celebrity friends with her to watch the Chiefs play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift and Brittany Mahomes, the wife of the Chiefs star quarterback, became friends as well. The two were seen together frequently during the season, then celebrating on the field with their men as they hoisted the Vince Lombardi Trophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahomes was introduced to Swift after a Week 3 game against the Chicago Bears, when the pop star made her first appearance for a football game at Arrowhead Stadium. According to Time Magazine, Swift recalled meeting Mahomes briefly in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/patrick-mahomes-explains-why-he-avoided-calling-tight-gun-control-laws-shooting-endorsing-president&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mahomes gushed&lt;/a&gt; about Swift and applauded her work ethic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’ve met a lot of famous people now in my life,&quot; Mahomes said. &quot;Taylor’s probably the most down-to-earth person that’s been on that stage for that long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/panthers-adam-thielen-sounds-off-nfls-ban-controversial-tackle-kind-bummer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PANTHERS&apos; ADAM THIELEN SOUNDS OFF ON NFL&apos;S BAN OF CONTROVERSIAL TACKLE: &apos;KIND OF A BUMMER&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She’s never not working,&quot; he added. &quot;Even when she’s taking her downtime, she’s working on something. Shooting a music video or singing a song or writing a song. You can see it by how she talks. Even when she’s talking about football, when she’s learning it, you can see her business mind putting it together. It’s almost like she’s trying to become a coach. ‘Why can’t you try this, this and this?’ She’s asking the right questions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansas City wasn’t exactly favored to win the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/super-bowl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With two weeks left in the regular season, the Chiefs found themselves losers in four of six games. They managed to persevere against the Cincinnati Bengals on New Year’s Eve and get by the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFL fans wondered whether Swift&apos;s presence created a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We just embraced it,&quot; Mahomes told Time Magazine of the doubts. &quot;We like having that visibility. At the end of the day, football has always been this bruising sport. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We want to make it fun, where kids grow up and play football and show their personality and be who they are. This year really magnified that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patience helped the Chiefs stun the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/philadelphia-eagles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 and knock off the San Francisco 49ers in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, they have a three-peat in their sights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Watch out for the new ‘ghost hackers’</title>
                    
                    <description>Learn how to secure social media accounts, implement legacy contacts, and create a digital estate plan to protect your online assets from &amp;apos;ghost hackers&amp;apos; after your death.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Imagine if this happened to you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/departed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Your spouse passed away&lt;/a&gt; and a few weeks after the funeral, you get a message from them that says, &quot;Hi, hope you’re having a great day.&quot; Other friends report they’re getting similar messages from your spouse. Some messages offer big returns in crypto investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join over 500,000 people who get tech smart with my free newsletter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getkim.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s easy to sign up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and one click to cancel if you don’t like it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ghost hackers&quot; have taken over your spouse’s account. It’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/cybercrime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sick new scam&lt;/a&gt;. With account owners dead and families focused on grief, the hacking is more likely to go unnoticed. It’s awful, and I want to make sure this doesn’t happen to you or someone you love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/tech/see-what-home-you-grew-up-looks-like-now-other-maps-tricks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE WHAT THE HOME YOU GREW UP IN LOOKS LIKE NOW AND OTHER MAPS TRICKS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not just trolling and ‘investments’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ghost hackers monitor obituaries and death notices for potential targets. Then, they use their arsenal (hacking weak passwords, guessing security questions and accessing previously leaked credentials) to break in. Often, hackers leapfrog into banking and retirement accounts, making it easy to steal directly from the person who passed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best offense is a good defense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know firsthand there are a ton of administrative tasks to take care of when a close family member dies — everything from canceling cellphone plans to executing the will. This list now also needs to include memorializing or deleting their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;social media accounts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, social networks have processes in place for this. For &lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;, ask &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/help/requestmemorialization&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Facebook to memorialize the account&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll need a link to an obituary. You can also request the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/help/1518259735093203?helpref=faq_content&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;profile be removed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Instagram&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.instagram.com/264154560391256&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;similar steps&lt;/a&gt; to Facebook, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/contact-x-about-a-deceased-family-members-account&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;same goes&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, take time to protect yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Facebook, you can designate a legacy contact to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;manage your account&lt;/a&gt; if you die. They won’t be able to log in, read your messages or delete friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/tech/can-you-spot-election-deepfakes-heres-how-not-be-duped&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAN YOU SPOT ELECTION DEEPFAKES? HERE’S HOW NOT TO BE DUPED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/iphone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Apple’s Legacy Contact&lt;/a&gt; is a safe, secure way to give someone access to data stored in your Apple account after you die. You can add more than one Legacy Contact, and all of them can access the account to make decisions. The person must be 13 or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to set it up on your iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, adjust &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;your Google account&lt;/a&gt;. You probably have a few things you’d prefer to keep private in your search, watch and location history. By default, Google auto-deletes account records after 18 months. If you want to shorten that window, you can do so in a few steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Really, you need a digital estate plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not a legal document but rather a rundown of all your accounts, passwords &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/tech&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;and online assets&lt;/a&gt; with instructions on how to find them. My Mom made one before she passed, and I can’t tell you how much time and stress it saved me during an incredibly emotional time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-lawmaker-shares-biggest-fear-her-kids-data-online-congress-eyes-federal-privacy-rules&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP LAWMAKER SHARES &apos;BIGGEST FEAR&apos; ABOUT HER KIDS&apos; DATA ONLINE AS CONGRESS EYES FEDERAL PRIVACY RULES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your list can be as formal or informal as you like. It could be an Excel spreadsheet or Word doc that includes websites, login details and anything else you want to leave behind. If you go this route, password-protect the file and leave the password in your will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re comfortable with it, I highly recommend you do this in a password manager. Most have the option to set up a contact who can access your logins when you pass. Use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3IAlqzA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;password notebook&lt;/a&gt; if you’re more comfortable with pen and paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a checklist to get you started:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know it’s not fun to think about, but you’ll be helping your loved ones immensely if you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get tech-smarter on your schedule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Award-winning host Kim Komando is your secret weapon for navigating tech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2024, WestStar Multimedia Entertainment.

                    <title>China pushing US fentanyl crisis, House panel report reveals</title>
                    
                    <description>A new House report released Tuesday revealed that China is fueling the fentanyl crisis in the U.S. to create &amp;quot;chaos and devastation&amp;quot; from the epidemic.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has subsidized the manufacturing and export of materials used to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/opioid-crisis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;fentanyl and other synthetic drugs&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new House report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bipartisan report found that under the leadership of the CCP, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;People’s Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; (PRC) gives tax rebates and grants to companies that make certain fentanyl and synthetic drug precursors used by drug traffickers as long as they are sold outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Through its actions, as our report has revealed, the Chinese Communist Party is telling us that it wants more fentanyl entering our country,&quot; said Rep. Mike Gallagher, the Republican chairman of the special House committee. &quot;It wants the chaos and devastation that has resulted from the epidemic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report found that the Chinese government holds ownership interest in several companies tied to drug trafficking, and even thwarted investigations into illicit manufacturers by warning the targets of an investigation when U.S. law enforcement sent a formal request for assistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/grieving-mother-fentanyl-victim-calls-mayorkas-impeachment-daughter-murdered&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRIEVING MOTHER OF FENTANYL VICTIM CALLS FOR MAYORKAS&apos; IMPEACHMENT: ‘MY DAUGHTER WAS MURDERED’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee also said the PRC has failed to prosecute fentanyl and precursor manufacturers, and found no evidence of new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;criminal enforcement&lt;/a&gt; actions by Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., the top Democrat on the committee, said Chinese companies are also currently selling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/drugs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;synthetic opioids&lt;/a&gt; on their websites, and pointed to a screenshot of one such solicitation that committee staff found just Monday night in advance of the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/mexico-faces-dire-medical-fentanyl-shortage-worlds-top-illegal-producer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEXICO FACES DIRE MEDICAL FENTANYL SHORTAGE DESPITE BEING WORLD&apos; TOP ILLEGAL PRODUCER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are hundreds of these website posts — hundreds,&quot; Krishnamoorthi said. &quot;This is completely unacceptable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher and Krishnamoorthi called for forming a task force to combat the global illicit fentanyl supply chain and advised for more sanctions against those involved in drug trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>At least 29 suspected Maoist rebels were killed by police in India in the central state of Chhattisgarh on Tuesday; this comes three days before the beginning of a national election.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (AP) — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/indias-police-detain-dozens-protesters-demanding-release-opposition-leader&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Police in India&lt;/a&gt; killed at least 29 suspected Maoist rebels in the central state of Chhattisgarh on Tuesday, authorities said, three days ahead of the start of a national election in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/indian-prime-minister-narendra-modi-visits-kashmirs-main-city-discuss-development-projects&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Prime Minister Narendra Modi&lt;/a&gt; is seeking a third term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a statement, police launched a raid after a tipoff about the presence of Maoists in the Kanker district. Three members of the security forces were wounded in the gunfight, after which police seized several weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/3-men-arrested-alleged-gang-rape-tourist-india&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 MEN ARRESTED FOR ALLEGED GANG RAPE OF TOURIST IN INDIA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian soldiers have been battling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/maoist-rebels-kill-11-explosive-attack-central-india&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Maoist rebels&lt;/a&gt; across several central and northern states since 1967, when the militants — also known as Naxalites — began fighting to demand more jobs, land and wealth from natural resources for the country’s poor indigenous communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian government says the insurgents, inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, pose the country’s most serious internal security threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rebels are active in several parts of India, especially in Chhattisgarh, one of the country&apos;s poorest states despite its vast mineral wealth, and often attack government troops and officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian Home Minister Amit Shah vowed to eliminate insurgency from the state and described it as the &quot;biggest enemy of development, peace and bright future of youth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are determined to free the country from the scourge of Naxalism,&quot; Shah wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Legal experts said the Biden administration was &quot;on the ropes&quot; in Tuesday’s oral arguments &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/supreme-court&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;at the Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; in a case questioning whether a Jan. 6 rioter can be charged with a federal &quot;obstruction&quot; crime, which carries implications for former President Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Jeffrey Green, lawyer for Joseph Fischer – who is one of more than 300 people charged by the Justice Department with &quot;obstruction of an official proceeding&quot; in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol – argued that the federal statute shouldn’t apply and that it had only ever been applied to evidence-tampering cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/justice-department&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; argued that Fischer’s actions were a &quot;deliberate attempt&quot; to stop a joint session of Congress directly from certifying the 2020 election, thus qualifying their use of the statute that criminalizes behavior that &quot;otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do&quot; and carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But legal experts told Fox News Digital that the government’s argument started to &quot;fall apart&quot; after questioning from the justices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-debate-sleeper-case-affect-trump-federal-prosecution&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUPREME COURT TO DEBATE &apos;SLEEPER&apos; CASE THAT COULD AFFECT TRUMP FEDERAL PROSECUTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Turley, a practicing criminal defense attorney and professor at George Washington University, praised Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar as one of &quot;the best appellate litigators&quot; but said she appeared &quot;clearly on the ropes&quot; and &quot;made some uncharacteristic concessions&quot; on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned whether, under the government’s argument, heckling at the State of the Union address or the recent incident of Rep. Jaamal Bowman, D-N.Y., pulling a fire alarm and diverting a House vote would constitute &quot;obstruction.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are multiple elements of the [statute] that I think might not be satisfied by those hypotheticals,&quot; Prelogar replied, adding that obstruction requires &quot;meaningful interference&quot; and &quot;corrupt intent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/special-counsel-jack-smith-hits-back-judge-fundamentally-flawed-legal-premise-trump-documents-case&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH HITS BACK AT JUDGE FOR &apos;FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED LEGAL PREMISE&apos; IN TRUMP DOCUMENTS CASE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gorsuch laid bare the problems for the government&apos;s argument,&quot; Turley said. &quot;This is where the government&apos;s arguments seem to fall apart in that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When pressed … Prelogar started to introduce contextual standards and said that these would just not be strong cases. And that was not the way to go, in my opinion.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrie Severino, former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas and president of the Judicial Crisis Network, noted that the government &quot;had a hard time explaining how this wasn&apos;t going to be such a broad, open door that it could allow a lot of behavior that we clearly understand to be protected First Amendment speech – peaceful protests, etc. – to get swept in the way that they&apos;re charging it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There’s not a First Amendment right to trespass or to block things. But I think you do have to worry about … this is an incredibly draconian type of response that could be applied to things that we absolutely wouldn&apos;t believe should be subjected to a 20-year prison sentence,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich told Fox News Digital that the government &quot;shouldn’t be trying out untested or ‘novel’ theories in high-profile cases.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trials-heres-where-each-case-against-former-president-presumptive-gop-nominee-stands&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP TRIALS: HERE’S WHERE EACH CASE AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT AND PRESUMPTIVE GOP NOMINEE STANDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m a big believer in the rule of lenity. That basically means criminal statutes should be construed narrowly, and when in doubt, you err on the side of the individual and not just throw stuff against the wall,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice John Roberts pressed Prelogar about an opinion issued in 2019 by the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) – an office that serves as a legal adviser to the department and other executive agencies – which said the obstruction statute should be viewed narrowly and contradicts DOJ’s position in Tuesday’s case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prelogar said that opinion was never &quot;formally&quot; adopted, but she couldn’t say what the DOJ’s process is for formerly accepting an OLC paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was not a good moment or a good look for the government,&quot; Turley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There were a lot of shrugs coming from the government in this oral argument. I mean, time and time again, when pushed to the wall, the government would simply shrug off the contradiction. That&apos;s not going to work with these justices,&quot; Turley added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turley said that should the justices decide the case in favor of the Jan. 6 defendant, it could mean that Special Counsel Jack Smith drops the two obstruction counts against Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The obstruction counts allowed Smith to frame the president&apos;s remarks in a conspiracy to obstruct and prevent the counting of votes. The elimination of those counts makes the narrative more challenging for Smith because those two counts were emblematic of his narrative,&quot; Turley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That is, they specifically alleged an effort to obstruct the proceeding. Those two counts amplified that aspect of the government&apos;s theory.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decision in the case, Fischer v. United States, is expected in early summer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Excused juror reveals selection process for Trump&apos;s hush money trial: &apos;Not a fan&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>An excused juror in former President Donald Trump&amp;apos;s hush money trial spoke to Fox News Tuesday about the selection process after she was dismissed.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A potential juror in former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Donald Trump&apos;s hush money&lt;/a&gt; trial in New York City spoke to the media shortly after she was excused from the pool, highlighting the &quot;serious&quot; mood inside the courtroom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Definitely serious,&quot; former potential juror Kara McGee, who works in cybersecurity, said on Tuesday. &quot;…Everyone was really taking it upon themselves to step in and do civic duty here, regardless of what people came into it thinking about the defendant.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGee said that she told the court she could serve as juror in an unbiased manner, while noting in her comment to the media it would be &quot;very difficult for anyone really in this country to not come to this without prior opinions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We all have prior opinions on the defendant, unless you&apos;ve been living in a cardbox,&quot; she said. McGee said she was excused from the jury pool due to scheduling conflicts with her employment in cybersecurity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m not a fan,&quot; McGee added of her personal thoughts on Trump. &quot;During COVID-19, I lived with someone who was immunocompromised, and I think his handling of COVID-19 was abysmal,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/april-16-trump-hush-money-trial-enters-day-two-jury&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIVE UPDATES: TRUMP HUSH MONEY TRIAL ENTERS DAY TWO AS JURY SELECTION CONTINUES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial kicked off Monday with a pool of 96 jurors, before roughly 50 were excused on the first day for saying they could not be impartial in the case. An additional nine were removed Monday for other reasons. Of that pool, an estimated 35 candidates remained on Tuesday morning, with 14 of those excused by early Tuesday afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-kicks-off-day-two-hush-money-trial-directing-ire-conflicted-judge-trump-hating&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP KICKS OFF DAY TWO OF HUSH MONEY TRIAL DIRECTING IRE AT &apos;CONFLICTED&apos; JUDGE: &apos;TRUMP-HATING&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGee said two of the questions asked of potential jurors most clearly indicated how they felt about Trump and the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;One of which is: Do you have opinions about the ability for a former sitting president to be tried in a court of law? Which I think the way people answered that showed how they felt about case,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-presiding-over-trump-hush-money-case-declines-recuse-himself&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;JUDGE PRESIDING OVER TRUMP HUSH MONEY CASE DECLINES TO RECUSE HIMSELF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The other one was: Do you have any opinions about legal limits for campaign finance donation amounts? Which I believe was another one that was kinda meant to gauge feelings about the particular case,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGee said she did make eye contact with Trump as she was excused from the trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I looked at him after I had finished giving final answer … I glanced over at him again, and made eye contact with him, and have no idea what he thought at that moment,&quot; she said of her interaction with Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday is the second day of trial in the hush money case, which marks the first time a former president has stood trial on criminal charges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced last year that Trump was charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records. The charges stem from the 2016 election cycle, when former Trump attorney Michael Cohen paid former pornographic actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 to allegedly silence her claims she had an extramarital affair with Trump back in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-calls-hush-money-trial-assault-america-case-officially-kicks-off&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP CALLS HUSH MONEY TRIAL &apos;ASSAULT ON AMERICA&apos; AS CASE OFFICIALLY KICKS OFF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors say the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen for the payment to Daniels and falsely recorded the payments as legal expenses. Prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified the records with an intent to commit or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conceal a second crime, which is a felony.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has repeatedly denied the affair and pleaded not guilty to the charges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump spoke to the media earlier Tuesday morning, ahead of entering the courtroom, where he railed against presiding Judge Juan Merchan as a &quot;conflicted&quot; judge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trial-jury-selection-resume-possible-jurors-excused-saying-they-could-not-be-impartial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP TRIAL: JURY SELECTION TO RESUME AFTER POSSIBLE JURORS EXCUSED FOR SAYING THEY COULD NOT BE IMPARTIAL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trump-hating judge&lt;/a&gt;. We have a judge who shouldn&apos;t be on this case. He&apos;s totally conflicted. But this is a trial that should never happen. It should have been thrown out a long time ago,&quot; Trump said Tuesday morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s a trial that is being looked upon and looked at all over the world. … They&apos;re looking at, analyzing it. Every legal pundit, every legal scholar said this trial is a disgrace,&quot; he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial is anticipated to last at least six weeks, with jury selection expected to last at least a week. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Circus performer follows in parents&apos; footsteps as human cannonball, feeling 7 G&apos;s with each launch</title>
                    
                    <description>Skyler Miser has grown up around the circus. Now as the Ringling Rocket, she knows circus life well, as both of her parents are also former performers.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The circus is full of compelling acts, dangerous stunts and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/arts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;entertaining performers&lt;/a&gt;. One performer who is part of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp;amp; Bailey is Skyler Miser, who stars as the Ringling Rocket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the show, in some cases three times a day, Miser acts as a human cannonball — she&apos;s blasted through the air out of a rocket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though this is Miser’s first time performing as the Ringling Rocket, she&apos;s no stranger to circus life. She was born into it, she told Fox News Digital during a stop in Worcester, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/my-world-has-changed-forever-ohio-girls-big-success-big-apple-radio-city-rockette&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&apos;MY WORLD HAS CHANGED FOREVER&apos;: OHIO GIRL&apos;S BIG SUCCESS IN BIG APPLE AS A RADIO CITY ROCKETTE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/parenting/family&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;parents, Brian and Tina Miser,&lt;/a&gt; performed as human cannonballs before her, making her upbringing extremely unique. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Growing up in the circus has been the best experience. There&apos;s not a lot of people that can say that they grew up in the circus, but I did,&quot; Skyler Miser said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s not an experience that everybody gets to experience. I don&apos;t know anything more. It&apos;s been my life since I was born — Ringling has been my life since I was born. So to actually be here and to be performing is really incredible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though a childhood spent traveling with her performing parents in their motor home was less than ordinary, there was still some normalcy in her day-to-day schedule, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We had a nursery. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;We had a school there,&lt;/a&gt; so I did grow up on the show learning regular school stuff, playing with other children. But of course, they didn&apos;t think that our lifestyle was weird, either,&quot; Miser said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not long before Miser started to perform herself. Her first professional performance came at age 13, but her very first time on stage came far earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My first professional performance, I did the aerial silks. My dad was working, and he was doing the rocket on another show, and he thought it would be fun for me to come and join them, so that was my first professional experience,&quot; Miser said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My first time ever actually being out on stage was on Ringling. I was 2. My parents did an act in the pre-show for about five minutes. So my dad would do a high fall and my mom would give a little speech about the cannon and that act.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Miser does not remember the details from her first, smaller scale launch that she completed at 11 years old when the family &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/indiana&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;was based in Indiana&lt;/a&gt; — one thing she will never forget is the feeling she got flying through the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/why-do-we-say-break-leg-popular-expressions-fun-origin-stories&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY DO WE SAY ‘BREAK A LEG’ AND OTHER POPULAR EXPRESSIONS? HERE ARE 3 FUN ORIGIN STORIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My very first time I was 11 years old, so I don&apos;t really remember much from then. It was February and it was freezing cold outside. So my dad had made an eight-foot-long cannon for a clown act in England,&quot; said Miser. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Before he sent it over, he asked if I wanted to be the ‘test dummy.’ So, of course, I said yes. I only went about 18 feet, but I remember that thrill and that big adrenaline rush I got even from that 18 feet … When I started going farther when I was 18, I didn&apos;t realize that that very first shot I did was very baby compared to what I&apos;m about to do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it feel like to fly through the air at the speed Miser does with each show? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She described the feeling as &quot;a mini car crash.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think the rocket is more mentally challenging than physically. Obviously, it takes a physical toll on you, because you&apos;re going at 7 G&apos;s,&quot; Miser said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I like to think of it as like a mini car crash every show. You have to make sure that you&apos;re really warmed up and your body&apos;s well-prepared,&quot; she told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Otherwise, you can get hurt. We do lots of checks before the show. So I&apos;m going and I&apos;m checking things every 30 minutes, just because if you don&apos;t check something, you might forget something. So it&apos;s just a lot of mental preparation, a lot of stretching.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the days Miser is not being launched through the air for her daring circus act — landing on what looks like a giant inflated pillow — she enjoys exploring whatever city she is in and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;trying some of the local cuisine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The typical day off is interesting. Normally, I like to sleep and just kind of recover from the week that we just had ... Depends on the city. I like to go out and find historical things to do. I&apos;m a big foodie ...so finding fun restaurants,&quot; Miser said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who has grown up around the circus for her entire life, Miser has been able to see the way it has evolved and changed over the years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve seen the show change completely. Even from when I was a kid to before when they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/ringling-bros-and-barnum-bailey-circus-drop-curtain-on-greatest-show-on-earth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;closed in 2017,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Miser said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It took a switch, but I think that&apos;s what you have to do in order to keep up with the current times of the entertainment industry.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Trump trial: Why can&apos;t Americans see or hear what is going on inside the courtroom?</title>
                    
                    <description>Former President Donald Trump is the first U.S. president to face criminal charges in an American courtroom, yet most of the country is getting news about the trial secondhand.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — It&apos;s a moment in history — the first U.S. president facing criminal charges in an American courtroom. Yet only a handful of observers are able to see or even hear what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, most of the nation is getting news of former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/five-most-dramatic-moments-first-day-trumps-hush-money-trial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Donald Trump&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; hush money trial secondhand. Starting with preliminary motions and jury selection Monday, reporters in a Manhattan courtroom must convey what is being said to the outside world after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trial-jury-selection-resume-possible-jurors-excused-saying-they-could-not-be-impartial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP TRIAL: JURY SELECTION TO RESUME AFTER POSSIBLE JURORS EXCUSED FOR SAYING THEY COULD NOT BE IMPARTIAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s all because New York state law regarding media coverage of court proceedings is one of the most restrictive in the country. Last week&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/oj-simpson-new-york-times-oj-simpson-sparks-outcry-saying-world-ruined-murder-trial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;death of O.J. Simpson&lt;/a&gt;, whose murder trial beamed live from a California courtroom captivated a nation three decades ago, was a telling reminder of how New York is behind the times — or, at least, a holdout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHY WON&apos;T NEW YORK LET ME SEE IT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulations limiting media coverage in courtrooms date back nearly a century, when the spectacle of bright flashbulbs and camera operators standing on witness tables during the 1935 trial of the man accused of kidnapping and killing Charles Lindbergh&apos;s baby son horrified the legal community, according to a 2022 report by the New York-based Fund for Modern Courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rules to enforce decorum spread nationally, amended to account for the invention of television, as defense lawyers worried that video coverage would harm their cases, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet an interest in open government chipped away at these laws and — slowly, carefully — video cameras began to be permitted in courts across the country, often at the discretion of judges presiding in individual cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York allowed them, too, on an experimental basis between 1987 and 1997, but they were shut down. Lobbyists for defense lawyers remain strong in New York and hold particular sway among lawyers in the state Assembly, said Victor Kovner, a former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/law-enforcement-officers-killed-gunfire-ambush-identified-new-york-officials&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; corporation counsel who advocates for open courtrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York and Louisiana are the only states remaining that completely restrict video coverage, the Fund for Modern Courts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Kovner and others, that&apos;s outrageous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re the media capital of the world, we like to think, and the fact that cameras aren&apos;t permitted in one of our three branches of government is unacceptable,&quot; said New York State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who has sponsored a bill to try to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s one of the most consequential trials of our modern age,&quot; the senator said. &quot;I think the public has a right to see exactly what happens in that courtroom.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the trial&apos;s first day, some reporters suggested that it appeared there were times that Trump drifted off to sleep while watching the proceedings. The former president&apos;s campaign disputed that. With no video camera in place and trained on him, there&apos;s no way of knowing for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WAIT — I SAW A PICTURE OF TRUMP IN COURT AT THE TRIAL&apos;S START&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s because the presiding judge, Juan M. Merchan, permitted a handful of still photographers to shoot photos of Trump before the day&apos;s proceedings started. Once court was called into session, courtroom sketch artists — a dying communications form — hold sway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is actually some video coverage of the trial, available on monitors in an overflow room adjacent to the main courtroom. It was packed Monday with reporters, court officers and a few members of the public, including Ron Sinibaldi, a former accountant from Long Island who lined up outside the courthouse before midnight for a seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I read presidential biographies,&quot; Sinibaldi said. &quot;I go to presidential libraries. I&apos;m here for the history.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW CAN THOSE INVOLVED GET AROUND THE RESTRICTIONS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a hallway outside of the courtroom, a limited number of cameras and a small pool of reporters are positioned to capture remarks of anyone involved in the trial who want to address the outside world. That included Trump, even before the proceedings started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absent live coverage of the trial, how often the former president chooses to take advantage of those cameras and whether news organizations carry his remarks either live, taped or not at all will play a big role in how the case is perceived publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSNBC carried his remarks live on Monday morning. &quot;They&apos;re trying to grab the narrative regardless of the outcome,&quot; CNN reporter Phil Mattingly said of the Trump defense team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW ARE JOURNALISTS COVERING THE TRIAL HANDLING IT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With some difficulty. CNN stationed a team on the streets of Manhattan outside the courtroom, where a truck festooned with pro-Trump flags frequently drove by, blaring horns and music from loudspeakers. Reporters sometimes struggled to be heard. &quot;It is kind of a circus down here,&quot; CNN&apos;s Kaitlan Collins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commentators and experts, many of them with experience in jury selection, offered opinions from outside the courtroom or from studios. Fox News analyst Jonathan Turley said &quot;most cities, at least those outside of New York,&quot; will see the case as a weaponization of criminal justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With estimates that jury selection could take two weeks, and no way of showing it, journalists will have a lot of time to fill unless they turn their attention elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WILL OTHER TRUMP CASES BE TELEVISED?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgia, where Trump faces charges of election meddling, gives judges discretion over whether to allow television cameras. Superior Court of Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee has said he will make all hearings and trials in that case available for broadcast. That has already included hearings on whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis would be allowed to argue the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal courts do not allow cameras in criminal cases. Trump is facing separate federal cases for election interference and mishandling classified documents, although it is not clear when, or if, trials will take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feds offer one glimmer of hope: The U.S. Supreme Court permits audio of oral arguments to be broadcast outside of the courtroom. But there&apos;s no indication that this would apply to Trump&apos;s case. New York&apos;s law does not allow audio coverage of his hush money trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proponents of legislation to open up New York courts to electronic media coverage are hoping the attention paid to the Trump case may boost their proposals. The idea is being considered as part of current negotiations over the New York state budget so, theoretically, a new law could even affect the Trump trial if it is passed and goes into effect immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given New York state&apos;s history, it&apos;s best not to count on it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>The lawyer for Lee Chatfield, the former leader of the Michigan House, said Tuesday that prosecutors plan to file charges against Chatfield for financial crimes.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Prosecutors plan to file charges of financial crimes against the former leader of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michigan-gop-lawmakers-slam-taxpayer-funded-rent-subsidies-migrants-pending-asylum-applications&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; House, his lawyer said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-michigan-ag-calls-tlaib-cruel-hateful-israel-comments&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Attorney General Dana Nessel&lt;/a&gt; said she would speak to reporters in the state capital at 2 p.m. EDT. Her office disclosed no other details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/swing-states-dem-governor-condemns-death-to-america-chants-her-state-more-than-week-after-protest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SWING STATE&apos;S DEM GOVERNOR CONDEMNS &apos;DEATH TO AMERICA&apos; CHANTS IN HER STATE MORE THAN A WEEK AFTER PROTEST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ex-michigan-house-speaker-aides-plead-not-guilty-embezzlement-nonprofit-funds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Lee Chatfield&lt;/a&gt;, a Republican who is no longer a state lawmaker, was House speaker in 2019 and 2020 when the GOP controlled the chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;ve learned that the charges are financial in nature,&quot; Chatfield&apos;s attorney, Mary Chartier, told The Associated Press. &quot;We&apos;re prepared to fight them each and every step of the way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It took almost 2 1/2 years for the AG&apos;s office to come up with charges. It&apos;s going to be pretty flimsy if it took that long,&quot; Chartier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chatfield has been under investigation since his sister-in-law said he sexually assaulted her. He has denied the allegations and said they had a consensual affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;ve learned there is no CSC charge or something like that,&quot; Chartier told AP, referring to criminal sexual conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people who were top aides to Chatfield when he ran the House were charged last year with crimes, including embezzlement from nonprofit funds created for political purposes. Rob and Anne Minard have pleaded not guilty.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Scott Peterson, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/true-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;convicted wife killer&lt;/a&gt; who has maintained his innocence since before his arrest in 2004, returned to court Tuesday to withdraw a motion to seal a document in the case after prosecutors told the court most of the information is already public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A California jury found Peterson guilty in 2004 of the murders of his pregnant wife, Laci, and their unborn son, Conner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At issue were the identities of some witnesses whose names have already come out in the nearly 20 years since Peterson&apos;s conviction. However, other witnesses&apos; identities have not even been divulged to prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 20-minute hearing was largely uneventful ahead of another one next month expected to delve into DNA evidence that the defense believes could clear Peterson&apos;s name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/scott-peterson-killer-pregnant-wife-sports-new-look-court-latest-bid-freedom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCOTT PETERSON, KILLER OF PREGNANT WIFE, SPORTS NEW LOOK IN COURT IN LATEST BID FOR FREEDOM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 51-year-old appeared remotely from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ione, California&apos;s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Mule Creek State Prison wearing a blue collared shirt. He only spoke in response to the judge when she asked if he could hear her and when asked if he consented to appearing remotely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is seeking a new trial with help from the Los Angeles Innocence Project, which picked up his case in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key evidence against Scott Peterson:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/story/timeline-the-laci-peterson-case&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TIMELINE: THE LACI PETERSON CASE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A California court initially sentenced Peterson to death for the murders, and while the sentence was later overturned, his appeal for a new trial failed in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/scott-peterson-case-taken-los-angeles-innocence-project-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Los Angeles Innocence Project&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are seeking new DNA testing on a hammer linked to a burglary across the street from the Peterson family home as well as a stained mattress found in a burned-out van parked less than a mile away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peterson and his supporters have long focused on suspects who allegedly burglarized the Medina family house across the street from his home, alleging they could have killed his wife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Peterson has previously raised issues of juror misconduct and the potential that the burglars could have abducted and killed his wife, the new appeal hinges on conducting new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/natural-science/genetics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA testing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the mattress with present-day technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional hearings on DNA evidence and discovery have been scheduled for May 29 and July 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His stint in state prison began in March 2005.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Crop-rich California region may fall under state monitoring to preserve groundwater flow</title>
                    
                    <description>In a first-of-its kind move, California might regulate groundwater use in part of San Joaquin Valley; this comes 10 years after lawmakers tasked local communities with managing the resource.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-sues-beach-city-voter-id-law-backed-majority-residents&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; might step in to regulate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/groundwater-reservoir-levels-remain-at-historic-lows-but-rainwater-and-flooding-should-help&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;groundwater&lt;/a&gt; use in part of the crop-rich San Joaquin Valley, which would be a first-of-its-kind move that comes a decade after lawmakers tasked local communities with carefully managing the precious but often overused resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At issue is control over a farming-dependent area where state officials say local water agencies haven’t come up with a strong enough plan to keep the water flowing sustainably into the future. The State Water Resources Control Board will hold a hearing Tuesday to decide whether to place the region under monitoring, which would mean state, not local, officials would temporarily watch over and limit how much water could be pumped from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-considers-adding-treated-wastewater-drinking-supply-new-proposal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CALIFORNIA CONSIDERS ADDING TREATED WASTEWATER TO DRINKING SUPPLY THROUGH NEW PROPOSAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s a huge deal,&quot; said Dusty Ference, executive director of the Kings County Farm Bureau, which represents regional farmers. &quot;What you gain in having local control is the ability to build groundwater recharge projects and some flexibility with how water is used and moved and traded or not.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ference said the state board wouldn’t have the local expertise or staff to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It will just be, ‘Here’s the pumping amount we authorize. Do with it what you can.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hearing is seen as a test of how California’s groundwater rules are working 10 years after lawmakers passed them. The limits came after years of overpumping and drought led to a host of problems ranging from residential wells running dry to sinking land. The goal was to make the most critically overdrafted groundwater basins sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities have since formed groundwater sustainability agencies and drafted management plans. In the Tulare Lake Subbasin, five local agencies worked on a single proposal, only to see it rejected last year by the state Department of Water Resources over concerns about lowering groundwater levels, sinking land and degrading groundwater quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the state water board steps in after Tuesday’s hearing, officials could require anyone who extracts more than a minimal amount of groundwater to report how much they take and pay fees for it. The state could also require larger pumpers to install and use meters that measure water use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tulare Lake Subbasin covers a stretch of Kings County, which is home to about 150,000 people halfway between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/los-angeles-hot-water-spending-hundreds-millions-worsening-homeless-crisis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; and San Francisco. The county is a major producer of milk, pistachios, cotton and processed tomatoes, according to a county agricultural report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also home to Tulare Lake, a large, dry basin that fills with water in rainy years. The lake most recently reappeared in 2023 after intense winter downpours that flooded farms and roads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doug Freitas, an almond grower who owns property in areas governed by three different groundwater agencies, said each agency has been talking about what to do next. He said he knew about the state’s groundwater law, but like most small farmers, he was so busy trying to make ends meet that he couldn’t foresee the impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a farmer, my opinion is we need more time,&quot; Freitas said. &quot;I would like to go to that meeting and beg for mercy and ask for them to let us come back to the table.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the agencies, the Mid-Kings River Groundwater Sustainability Agency, proposed an April 23 vote on charging landowners fees and limiting pumping. The move has met with some resistance, and agency director Dennis Mills recently told residents something must be done if they want to try to keep the state from stepping in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They will not accept more promises at this point,&quot; Mills said. &quot;Just a revised plan is not good enough. They need to see concrete steps as to how we’re addressing these things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there are people like Joaquin Contente, a longtime dairy farmer in Kings County, who said pumping fees and caps spell trouble for him, whether they are imposed by local or state officials. He relies on groundwater to grow the alfalfa he feeds his 800 cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know there’s a lot of people losing sleep over it, because I am one of them,&quot; Contente said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ference, the farm bureau director, said he supports local control so that farmers can have a say in what happens and communities can invest in local recharge projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a community, countywide issue that, if it’s not managed properly, will be catastrophic,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>House delivers Mayorkas impeachment articles to Schumer, setting up trial proceedings</title>
                    
                    <description>The long-awaited articles of impeachment against DHS Secretary Mayorkas were delivered to the Senate on Tuesday, setting in motion a required procedure in the upper chamber.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;House impeachment managers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-mayorkas-impeachment-articles-gop-dismissal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;officially delivered two articles&lt;/a&gt; of impeachment passed against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., shortly after 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After delaying the planned delivery last week and pushing it to Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., directed impeachment managers to bring the long-anticipated articles to the Senate, which will set off a number of procedural actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-dems-reveal-massive-79-million-ad-spend-protect-majority-ahead-key-match-ups&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SENATE DEMS REVEAL MASSIVE $79M AD SPEND TO PROTECT MAJORITY AHEAD OF KEY MATCH UPS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The articles were initially passed in February, but the House held off sending them to the Senate until after the appropriations process was over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With custody of the articles, Schumer has urged all senators to be present during the week as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-mayorkas-impeachment-articles-gop-dismissal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;they will be sworn in&lt;/a&gt; as jurors for the impeachment trial on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-tuberville-quarterly-abortion-reports-veterans-affairs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALABAMA SENATOR SEEKS TO EXPOSE ABORTIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once sworn in, it&apos;s unclear whether a trial will proceed. Republicans in the Senate have accused their Democratic counterparts of wanting to dismiss the trial, using a motion to table, effectively killing it. And while some Democrats, such as Sen. Tammy Baldwin, Wis., said they haven&apos;t heard about plans for their caucus to do this, others have pushed for it. Sens. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who are both up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-dems-reveal-massive-79-million-ad-spend-protect-majority-ahead-key-match-ups?intcmp=tw_fnc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;competitive re-election races&lt;/a&gt;, as is Baldwin, revealed they want to dismiss the impeachment trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-ukraine-loan-dems-gop-aid-package&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP&apos;S LOAN PROPOSAL FOR UKRAINE AID MAY BE COMMON GROUND FOR COMPREHENSIVE FOREIGN AID PACKAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Democratic senators prepping for tough re-election battles in November have been considered the factors that will decide whether the trial moves forward. Sens. Bob Casey, D-Penn., Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Baldwin still haven&apos;t revealed their plans. Each vote will be critical, as the Senate is divided narrowly 51 to 49, Democrats to Republicans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schumer has not indicated whether Democrats will seek a procedural off-ramp for the trial, as some caucus members have said they would like to see. However, the majority leader said in a recent statement, &quot;We want to address this issue as expeditiously as possible,&quot; regarding the articles of impeachment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As I’ve said repeatedly, impeachment should never be used to settle a policy disagreement,&quot; Schumer also claimed. &quot;That would set a horrible precedent for the Congress.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) has advised all Republican competitors in key states with vulnerable Democratic incumbents to pressure their opponents in the impeachment trial. If those candidates seeking re-election look to dismiss the trial, Republicans are expected to hold it against them during the campaign. This could be particularly persuasive as the southern border has become an increasingly important issue for voters across the country. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (AP) — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/belgium-disband-military-platoon-serious-violence-harassment-defense-minister-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; police shut down a gathering of far-right politicians and supporters on Tuesday, citing concerns about public order, while attendees protested curbs on free speech and vowed to find another venue for Day 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual National Conservative conference, held this year in Brussels, comes ahead of Europe-wide elections. As campaigning for the June 6-9 event heats up, mainstream parties fear that disenchanted voters might turn to the people at NatCon 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/belgian-police-arrest-adult-3-minors-plot-attack-concert-hall&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BELGIAN POLICE ARREST ADULT, 3 MINORS IN PLOT TO ATTACK CONCERT HALL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is what we’re up against. We’re up against a new form of evil ideology,&quot; Nigel Farage, the man credited with taking Britain out of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/eu-lawmakers-approve-overhaul-migration-law-hoping-deprive-far-right-votes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, told the gathering of a few hundred stridently nationalist and fundamentalist Christian politicians and think-tankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-migrant sentiment featured in a number of speeches. Some targeted what they saw as the follies of climate policy, &quot;narco-socialism&quot; or &quot;woke indoctrination,&quot; often with sharp opposition to multinational organizations like the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lashing out at the bloc’s treaties, and the pledge in the preamble of the founding EU texts to an &quot;ever-closer Union&quot; among the 27 member countries, Polish lawmaker Ryszard Legutko said it all makes &quot;medieval monks look almost like intellectual anarchists.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys suggest that mainstream political parties are likely to retain power after the June elections, but quite possibly with a reduced majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belgian police quietly shut down the conference by barring attendees from re-entering the venue if they dared to leave. A dozen or so officers blocked the main entrance. It was the third venue for the gathering after the owners of two other locations shied away when anti-fascist protesters vowed to disrupt proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s NatCon, organized by the conservative U.S. think tank the Edmund Burke Foundation, was held under the banner of &quot;National Conservatism, Preserving the Nation-State in Europe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French far-right figurehead Eric Zemmour was scheduled to criticize the EU’s new migrant and asylum rules but was turned away by police. Suella Braverman, who served as U.K. home secretary for just over a month in 2022 before being fired, railed for 27 minutes against the European Court of Human Rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians and former leaders from Spain, Poland and the Netherlands were also on the agenda. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/hungary-pm-orban-blasts-western-world-calls-trump-victory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban&lt;/a&gt; was due to speak on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I guess they couldn’t take free speech any longer,&quot; Orban posted on the social media platform X. &quot;The last time they wanted to silence me with the police was when the Communists set them on me in ’88. We didn’t give up then and we will not give up this time either!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speakers summoned the grand ideas of figures like the Pope, Homer, Dostoyevsky, Leo Strauss, Tocqueville and Gramsci. English was the common language, spattered with classical Latin. Modern liberal democracy was likened to a form of &quot;neo-Marxist authoritarianism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mostly though, those who could speak before the gathering was shut down for the day focused on their &quot;enemies&quot; among the mainstream political parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have to know our enemies are in panic and they show it every day,&quot; said EU lawmaker Hermann Tertsch, from Spain’s far-right Vox party. &quot;The enemy knows their time is running out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Brussels police warned that the conference&apos;s time was limited, too, Edmund Burke Foundation Chairman Yoram Hazony invited participants to stay as long as they dared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The new democracy works in mysterious ways. Your goal as someone in the new democracy is to prevent the other guy from speaking,&quot; Hazony said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>New Jersey Republican introduces bill to block child labor from use in domestic EV industry</title>
                    
                    <description>FIRST ON FOX: Republican Rep. Chris Smith unveiled an effort to block cobalt extracted using child labor from being used to build U.S. electric vehicle batteries.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST ON FOX: &lt;/strong&gt;New Jersey Republican Rep. Chris Smith has introduced legislation that would ensure &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-finalizes-crackdown-gas-cars-forcing-more-than-50-of-car-sales-to-be-electric&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;minerals key to green energy&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. are not extracted using child labor in the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith&apos;s legislation — called the Stop China’s Exploitation of Congolese Children and Adult Forced Labor through Cobalt Mining Act — would specifically block cobalt extracted or processed with the use of child or forced labor from entering the U.S. market. Cobalt is a vital component of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, but is largely sourced from the DRC where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cecc.gov/events/hearings/from-cobalt-to-cars-how-china-exploits-child-and-forced-labor-in-the-congo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;human rights investigations&lt;/a&gt; have found child labor is rampant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Chinese companies often own cobalt mines in the DRC that export raw materials to China to be processed. The vast majority of worldwide cobalt is processed in Chinese facilities, according to the International Energy Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Communist Chinese government — which has gained almost full dominance of every single step of the cobalt supply chain — profits from child and forced labor used to extract cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo and power our so-called ‘green economy,’&quot; said Smith, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Global Human Rights Subcommittee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/study-casts-doubt-electric-vehicles-climate-cost-benefits-wont-achieve-goals-intended&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;STUDY CASTS DOUBT ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES&apos; CLIMATE, COST BENEFITS: &apos;WON&apos;T ACHIEVE THE GOALS INTENDED&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith&apos;s legislation was crafted alongside House Ways and Means Committee &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/jason-smith&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chairman Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo.,&lt;/a&gt; whose committee has jurisdiction over the bill. The committee will mark the legislation up on Wednesday, setting it up for a potential floor vote in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill was also written, in part, in response to a November congressional hearing chaired by Rep. Chris Smith that put a spotlight on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/researchers-reveal-ev-industry-can-still-linked-child-labor-fueled-mines&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;forced labor in the DRC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-nominee-wants-hijack-little-known-agency-ram-through-climate-agenda&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN NOMINEE WANTS TO HIJACK LITTLE-KNOWN AGENCY TO RAM THROUGH CLIMATE AGENDA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;America has long fought to end child and adult forced labor, yet the cobalt vital to the batteries in our technology is unethically mined with the use of forced labor under Chinese control,&quot; Rep. Jason Smith said. &quot;This legislation is a critical step to blocking material tainted by these inhumane labor practices from entering this country. I am thankful to Rep. Chris Smith for introducing this legislation to stop these dangerous practices.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, in 2023, the DRC produced 74% of the world&apos;s cobalt and is home to more than half of known global reserves of the mineral, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-cobalt.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S., on the other hand, mined less than 1% of the world&apos;s cobalt supply and contains less than 1% of its reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it remains unclear exactly how many of the mines are artisanal and employ child laborers, a USGS National Minerals Information Center study published in June determined that up to 11% of cobalt produced in the nation is tied to child labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Labor&apos;s Bureau of International Labor Affairs previously found that more than 40,000 children, including children as young as 6 years old, work in cobalt mines in the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stop China’s Exploitation of Congolese Children and Adult Forced Labor through Cobalt Mining Act comes as the Biden administration continues to push for a rapid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-cracks-down-on-diesel-trucks-in-bid-to-fight-climate-change-reduce-emissions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;economy-wide transition to electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. In recent weeks, the administration has finalized rules pushing for more than 50% of car sales to be electric by 2030 and a large share of trucks to be zero-emissions in that same timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Three years ago, I set an ambitious target: that half of all new cars and trucks sold in 2030 would be zero-emission,&quot; President Biden said last month. &quot;I brought together American automakers. I brought together American autoworkers. Together, we’ve made historic progress. Hundreds of new expanded factories across the country. Hundreds of billions in private investment and thousands of good-paying union jobs. And we’ll meet my goal for 2030 and race forward in the years ahead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Man gets 37 years for carjacking, kidnapping FBI employee in South Dakota</title>
                    
                    <description>Juan Alvarez-Sorto, a 25-year-old Salvadoran national, was sentenced to 37 years in prison Friday for carjacking and kidnapping an FBI employee in South Dakota.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of three people convicted of carjacking and kidnapping an FBI employee in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/south-dakota&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt; has been sentenced to 37 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juan Alvarez-Sorto, 25, was sentenced Friday in federal court, the Rapid City Journal reported. Alvarez-Sorto and Deyvin Morales, 29, were found guilty in January. Alvarez-Sorto also was convicted of unlawfully entering the U.S. after being deported to his home country, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/regions/central-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third suspect, 29-year-old Karla Lopez-Gutierrez, pleaded guilty in August. Morales and Lopez-Gutierrez are both scheduled for sentencing April 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/south-dakota-jury-finds-2-men-guilty-kidnapping-carjacking-fbi-employee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOUTH DAKOTA JURY FINDS 2 MEN GUILTY OF KIDNAPPING, CARJACKING FBI EMPLOYEE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said the trio left Greeley, Colorado, on May 5, 2022, and were on a &quot;drug trafficking trip&quot; to South Dakota in a Ford Expedition. Nearly out of gas at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Morales told the others they needed to &quot;take over&quot; a new vehicle, Lopez-Gutierrez testified in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A short time later, the FBI employee speeding in his Dodge Durango saw the Expedition and pulled over, believing it was a tribal officer. Prosecutors said the suspects took the Durango at gunpoint and forced the victim to go along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m still haunted by the trauma you inflicted upon me,&quot; the victim told Alvarez-Sorto at the sentencing hearing. He said Alvarez-Sorto threatened his family and held a gun to the back of his head as he was face-down in the Badlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the group stopped to buy gas and zip ties in the town of Hermosa, South Dakota, the victim managed to escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morales and Alvarez-Sorto were arrested in Greeley a week later. Lopez-Gutierrez was arrested in August 2022 in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/colorado&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Loveland, Colorado&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alvarez-Sorto’s attorney, Alecia Fuller, said his client was remorseful and noted that relatives had abused Alvarez-Sorto as a child.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A suspect has been arrested after allegedly killing a man at a northern &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/new-mexico&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; rest area, stealing a vehicle at knifepoint and leading state police on a car chase, authorities said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police said 21-year-old Dorien Ray was arrested Monday on suspicion of numerous charges including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;first-degree murder&lt;/a&gt;, armed robbery and possession of a stolen vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ray allegedly was driving a car reported stolen from Aurora, Colorado, when he stopped around 7 a.m. at a rest stop in Colfax County south of Raton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/former-unm-football-player-convicted-robbing-postal-carrier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORMER UNM FOOTBALL PLAYER CONVICTED OF ROBBING POSTAL CARRIER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ray is accused of fatally stabbing a 79-year-old man while the victim’s wife was in the bathroom, State Police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colorado couple was headed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/arizona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to Arizona&lt;/a&gt; before Ray drove off in their car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman told police that the vehicle was gone when she came out of the bathroom, and her husband was on the ground covered in blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A State Police officer spotted the stolen vehicle on Interstate 25 in San Miguel County, and Ray was arrested after the pursuit ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ray is from McComb, Mississippi, according to a criminal complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ray did not have an attorney assigned to his case as of Tuesday. But authorities said he should have a public defender at his initial court appearance Wednesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Trump risks losing key voter base with opposition to Arizona abortion law, pro-lifers say</title>
                    
                    <description>Pro-life and Christian activists say that former President Donald Trump risks alienating a key voting bloc with his moderated stance on abortion ahead of the 2024 election.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Former President Trump&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; opposition to a strict abortion ban in Arizona has put him at odds with pro-life and Christian activists, who represent a voter base key to his presidential election effort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Trump presidential campaign released a statement saying that states should decide how to regulate abortion. Days later, that position was tested when the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that an 1864 law banning abortion without exception for rape or incest should be enforced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, who claims to be the most pro-life president in U.S. history, said the court&apos;s decision &quot;went too far&quot; and urged lawmakers to &quot;ACT IMMEDIATELY, to remedy what has happened.&quot; He said that &quot;ideally&quot; anti-abortion laws must contain exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. In other comments, he expressed confidence that the Arizona law will be &quot;straightened out.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That message was ill-received by Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood director turned pro-life activist, who leads the group &quot;And Then There Were None.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-arizona-pro-life-law-went-too-far-biden-camp-claims-policy-u-turn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP SAYS ARIZONA PRO-LIFE LAW WENT ‘TOO FAR’ AS BIDEN CAMP CLAIMS POLICY U-TURN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What I heard was that [Trump] is a person that does not believe in banning abortion,&quot; Johnson told Fox News Digital in an interview. She said there was a conflict between Trump&apos;s position that states should decide for themselves and his statement that Arizona went &quot;too far.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So, here was a state that said we&apos;re going to ban abortion. And now he says, &apos;well, no, I don&apos;t want you to,&apos;&quot; Johnson said. &quot;That tells me he doesn&apos;t want to ban it at the federal level. But he also doesn&apos;t believe the states should have a right to ban it at the state level.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a disappointing development &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/planned-parenthood-clinic-what-should-know-about-workers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;for Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, who spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention in support of Trump&apos;s re-election. In her speech, she said Trump &quot;has done more for the unborn than any other president.&quot; She pointed to several of his accomplishments, including reinstating the Mexico City policy — critics call it the &quot;global gag rule&quot; — which blocks U.S. federal funding for non-governmental organizations that support abortion services, as well as appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, making state abortion restrictions possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Trump takes credit for his pro-life record regularly on the campaign trail. But he has also repeatedly criticized fellow Republicans for taking a hard-line stance on the issue, blaming candidates who did not allow for exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the pregnant person is at risk, for the GOP&apos;s setbacks in the 2022 midterm elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of politicians who are pro-life do not know how to discuss this topic, and they lose their election. We had a lot of election losses because of this, because they didn’t know to discuss it. They had no idea,&quot; he said last year at a leadership summit of the Concerned Women of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-abortion-should-be-decided-the-states-will-the-people&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP SAYS ABORTION SHOULD BE DECIDED BY THE STATES, &apos;WILL OF THE PEOPLE&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pro-life cause has also suffered a handful of defeats on ballot initiatives that enshrined abortion rights protections even in red states like Ohio and Kansas. Similar initiatives in Arizona and Florida, among other states, are expected to drive up turnout in the November election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Wolfe, a former Trump official who served in the State and Defense Departments, said those defeats show that &quot;the culture in America still loves abortion, or deeply misunderstands what is happening in an abortion.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfe is the executive director of the Center for Baptist Leadership (CBL), a newly-founded nonprofit that exists to revitalize the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), America&apos;s largest Christian protestant denomination. Though the group does not endorse or support political candidates, it released a statement last week chastising Trump for his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/abortion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;abortion position&lt;/a&gt; and urging him &quot;to forsake the advice of compromising political consultants.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Wolfe described the Arizona abortion ban as &quot;a great law&quot; and encouraged Trump to make an &quot;unapologetic moral argument&quot; about how abortion &quot;ends innocent life&quot; and &quot;should be recognized as murder.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Evangelicals and Southern Baptists are eager to support candidates who show unflinching courage and make moral arguments against the civilizational suicide that is abortion. I would encourage everybody to stand strong on this issue and run to it and not away from it, because we know that human life is valuable and should be protected from the moment of fertilization until the natural death,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/arizona-supreme-court-upholds-near-total-abortion-ban&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ARIZONA SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS NEAR-TOTAL ABORTION BAN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker Wildmon, vice president and spokesman of the American Family Association, said the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/arizona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Arizona Supreme Court ruling&lt;/a&gt; was a valid ruling that recognizes the pro-life position, that life begins at conception and should be protected until natural death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While giving Trump credit for his record, Wildmon said the former president&apos;s most recent statements are &quot;out of line with his party and the entire pro-life movement.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just as slavery was a stain on our country, abortion is also a stain on our country. So in our view, since we believe that every life begins at conception, any abortion is too many abortions,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wildmon warned that Trump risks alienating a significant number of Evangelical Christian voters by attempting to appeal to independents or suburban women by watering-down his pro-life stance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The reality is that wiggling or squirming on the abortion issue isn&apos;t going to pick him up many voters,&quot; he said. &quot;It will really suppress the Evangelical Christian vote. There&apos;s already Evangelical Christians out there, a large voting bloc in the Republican Party, that have some concerns about President Trump and how he handles things and his self-control.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that Trump &quot;really needs to be moving to the right on this issue&quot; to consolidate his supporters ahead of a general election showdown with President Biden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-skewers-trump-gops-shift-abortion-so-killing-babies-ok-some-states&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BILL MAHER SKEWERS TRUMP, GOP&apos;S SHIFT ON ABORTION: ‘SO KILLING BABIES IS OK IN SOME STATES?&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Republicans triangulate their position on the issue, Democrats have attempted to portray Trump as the man singularly responsible for stripping away women&apos;s rights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Here in Arizona, they have turned the clock back more than a century on women’s rights and freedoms. The overturning of Roe was a seismic event. And this ban in Arizona is one of the biggest aftershocks yet,&quot; Vice President &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kamala Harris&lt;/a&gt; said at a campaign event in Tuscon on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She called Trump &quot;the architect of this health care crisis&quot; and argued a second Trump term would mean &quot;more bans, more suffering, less freedom.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Burch, president of CatholicVote, said Trump appears mindful that far-reaching laws that restrict abortion access could make his re-election difficult. He and the other pro-life activists interviewed for this story emphasized that Trump remains the best alternative to President Biden for pro-life voters in the upcoming election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Trump may hold the position that, under the circumstances, states shouldn&apos;t go that far. And he&apos;s certainly entitled to that position. I believe he&apos;s wrong on that, but that&apos;s a far-cry from Joe Biden, who is saying he&apos;s willing to impose a nationwide abortion at any stage, for any reason, paid-for-by-taxpayers regime on the country,&quot; Burch told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Johnson said that many pro-life activists she&apos;s met with have told her Trump has lost their votes with his criticisms of the Arizona law and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/florida-supreme-court-approves-abortion-ballot-initiative-upholding-15-week-ban&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Florida&apos;s six-week abortion ban&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;It doesn&apos;t mean that they&apos;re going to go cast their vote for Biden, but they are not going to vote for Trump&quot; she told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think that just saying that you&apos;re pro-life is not going to be good enough anymore for some pro-life voters,&quot; Johnson added. &quot;And so while I think there&apos;s a lot of people who are waiting to see, and I&apos;m one of those people who are waiting to see if Trump is going to right this ship, I think that he does need to be very careful with how he moves forward between now and the election.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Paul Steinhauser and Anders Hagstrom contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Along a West Virginia trail, a camera caught on video the Allegheny woodrat, a rodent that is considered to be a &amp;quot;species of concern&amp;quot; in some American states.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An elusive rodent considered to be a &quot;sensitive species,&quot; has been spotted on a West Virginia trail in the Allegheny mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials of Monongahela National Forest, a unit of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, posted a video on Facebook last week showing a small creature moving around in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail camera had captured a 17-inch-long rodent known as an Allegheny woodrat which is on the Regional Forester’s Sensitive Species list, the post said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/rare-gray-wolf-hunted-michigan-currently-investigation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RARE GRAY WOLF KILLED DURING HUNT IN MICHIGAN, OFFICIALS LAUNCH INVESTIGATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The footage showing the woodrat was recorded on March 12, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social media post noted that Allegheny woodrats dwell &quot;primarily in hardwood forests with plenty of rocks and boulders.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the name and size of the creature may allude to a rat, the woodrats are more closely related to mice, according to officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The population of Allegheny woodrats is slowly declining in the U.S., with an estimated population of 100,000 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in the wild,&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. Forest Service reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/colorado-park-shock-one-bear-took-400-selfies-trap-camera-woods&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLORADO PARK SHOCK: ONE BEAR TOOK 400 &apos;SELFIES&apos; VIA TRAP CAMERAS IN THE WOODS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is still speculation surrounding the rodent&apos;s decline, but scientists have a few ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Many scientists blame the gypsy moth, which harms acorn-bearing oak trees (an important food source for Allegheny woodrats) and habitat degradation,&quot; the U.S. Forest Service wrote in the Facebook post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service considered the Allegheny woodrat to be a &quot;species of concern&quot; and in some states, including Pennsylvania, the rodent is listed as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/endangered&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;threatened and protected.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common predators of the elusive creature include raccoons, coyotes, weasels, great horned owls and black rat snakes, the Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC) reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At one time, the Allegheny woodrat&apos;s range extended from southwestern Connecticut west to Indiana and south to northern Alabama. It is now extirpated from Connecticut and New York, studies in remaining northern states document decline, and its status in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;southern states&lt;/a&gt; is unknown because of a shortage of recent surveys,&quot; according to the PGC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, both adult and young Allegheny woodrats were discovered in West Virginia&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/national-parks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Harpers Ferry National Historical Park,&lt;/a&gt; making this the first time the animal had been seen for 20 years, the National Park Service wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the discovery, officials were convinced the rodent had gone extinct in the area and other parts along the Appalachian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the U.S. Forest Service for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman said Monday that Donald Trump glared at her before walking out of the courtroom, after she reported that Trump had fallen asleep.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman said she noticed Donald Trump specifically staring at her after she reported he fell asleep in the courtroom during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/april-16-trump-hush-money-trial-enters-day-two-jury&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;hush money trial&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haberman, who was part of the reporter pool in the courtroom, gave live updates on the trial and reported that Trump had fallen asleep in the courtroom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You were actually in the room for that. At one point, the pool said that he was glaring at you for several seconds. You had reported shortly before that, during a break, that he appeared to be falling asleep at one point, as that proceedings were getting tedious. Did you notice that?&quot; host Kaitlan Collins asked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haberman said she did notice and added, &quot;he made a pretty specific stare at me and walked out of the room.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trial-jury-selection-resume-possible-jurors-excused-saying-they-could-not-be-impartial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP TRIAL: JURY SELECTION TO RESUME AFTER POSSIBLE JURORS EXCUSED FOR SAYING THEY COULD NOT BE IMPARTIAL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haberman wrote on Monday that Trump had appeared to be sleeping and added, &quot;his head keeps dropping down and his mouth goes slack.&quot; Minutes later, she had reported, &quot;Trump has apparently jolted back awake, noticing the notes his lawyer passed him several minutes ago.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She claimed Trump didn&apos;t like when such things were reported on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I reported earlier that he had appeared to fall asleep. Now, we had seen him – I want to be clear that I’ve seen lots of people fall asleep in courtrooms. I’ve seen jurors fall asleep. I’ve seen judges fall asleep. If anyone falls asleep who’s a criminal defendant in a case, we’re going to report on it. But he doesn’t like when such things are reported and I’m guessing – I don’t know – that that’s what this was about,&quot; Haberman told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think that having to sit there and be captive while we all report on him is going to be deeply uncomfortable for him because he is somebody who likes to control things,&quot; she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hush-money-trial-judge-tees-up-ruling-whether-trump-violated-gag-order-should-pay-thousands&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HUSH MONEY TRIAL JUDGE TEES UP RULING ON WHETHER TRUMP VIOLATED GAG ORDER, SHOULD PAY THOUSANDS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a dozen additional jurors have been excused from participating in the trial so far Tuesday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court started on Monday with 96 potential jurors, with roughly 50 being excused on Monday for saying they could not be impartial in the case, and an additional nine were removed for other reasons. That left roughly 35 candidates on Tuesday, and now 14 of those have been excused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manhattan District Attorney Alvin&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bragg-files-motion-hold-trump-contempt-alleged-gag-order-violations-threatens-30-days-jail-time&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; Bragg filed a motion&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday to hold Trump in contempt of court, claiming he violated the gag order imposed upon him by publishing three social media posts relating to two known witnesses in his criminal trial — Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bragg is urging Manhattan Judge Juan Merchan to also warn Trump that &quot;future violations&quot; of the gag order can be punished &quot;not only with additional fines, but also with a term of incarceration of up to thirty days.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Brooke Singman contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Texas set to be fined $100,000 per day after failing to investigate allegations of abuse in foster care system</title>
                    
                    <description>U.S. District Judge Janis Graham Jack is fining Texas $100,000 per day for not adequately investigating the allegations of abuse in the state&amp;apos;s foster care system.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/federal-courts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;federal judge&lt;/a&gt; is fining Texas $100,000 per day for routinely neglecting to adequately investigate allegations of abuse and neglect raised by children in the state’s struggling foster care system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Janis Graham Jack in Corpus Christi ruled Monday that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Texas Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; agency has shown contempt of her orders to fix the way the state investigates complaints by children in its care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the third such contempt finding in a case that began with a 2011 lawsuit over foster care conditions at the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, the child welfare arm of HHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/if-you-want-fix-foster-care-heres-where-start&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IF YOU WANT TO FIX FOSTER CARE, HERE&apos;S WHERE TO START&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 427-page ruling, the judge cited a &quot;continued recalcitrance&quot; by the agency&apos;s Provider Investigations unit to conduct thorough, accurate and timely probes of allegations of abuse, neglect and exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As demonstrated by the stories of the children and PI’s failure to take any action to remedy the egregious flaws identified by the Monitors, PI represents a significant, systemic failure that increases the risk of serious harm,&quot; the judge wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas has about 9,000 children in permanent state custody for factors that include the loss of caregivers, abuse at home or health needs that parents alone can’t meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The judge’s ruling is measured but urgent, given the shocking evidence,&quot; said attorney Paul Yetter, representing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/kids-foster-care-get-love-support-they-need-angels-committed-happiness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the foster children&lt;/a&gt; in the lawsuit. &quot;Innocent children are suffering every day. After all these years, when will state leadership get serious about fixing this disaster?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at the DFPS declined comment. A spokesperson at HHS said the agency, led by Commissioner Cecile E. Young, was reviewing the order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-attorney-general-sues-biden-administration-states-ability-work-faith-based-organizations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL SUES BIDEN ADMIN OVER STATE’S ABILITY TO WORK WITH FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the state have previously said that while there is always room for improvement, state officials have sufficiently complied with the court’s remedial orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state has also argued that the court monitors haven’t reviewed a large enough sample size of children to make sweeping conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fines levied against Texas will be lifted when the state can demonstrate that its investigations are in compliance. A hearing is set for late June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2019, court-appointed monitors have released periodic reports on DFPS progress toward eliminating threats to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ossoff-blackburn-inquiry-georgias-foster-care-system-after-alleged-abuse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;foster children’s safety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A January report cited progress in staff training, but continued weaknesses in responding to investigations into abuse and neglect allegations, including those made by children. Monitors also said children aren’t told how to report sexual abuse and the state hasn&apos;t proved that it has properly trained its caseworkers to identify potential victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one case, plaintiffs say, a girl was left in the same residential facility for a year while 12 separate investigations piled up around allegations that she had been raped by a worker there. The girl remained exposed to that worker until she was &quot;dumped in an emergency room, alone, with her jaw broken in two places,&quot; the judge said. The facility was eventually shut down by the state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The fan at the center of a viral video that showed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ufc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;UFC fighter Arman Tsarukyan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; throwing punches in his direction before his bout against Charles Oliveira on Saturday is speaking out after UFC President Dana White expressed concern over a potential lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident took place as Tsarukyan was walking out toward the octagon for his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufc-star-renato-moicano-praises-american-values-urges-fans-read-economists-teachings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;UFC 300&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; fight against Olveria. Videos shared online appeared to show the 27-year-old fighter throwing a punch at a fan before being ushered forward by security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear if Tsarukyan hit the fan or what prompted that altercation, but on Monday, the man came forward to clear a few things up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obed Ardon told &lt;a href=&quot;https://bloodyelbow.com/2024/04/15/dana-white-arman-tsarukyan-ufc-300/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bloody Elbow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he was attending the fight with his brother, and while getting caught up in the excitement, he flipped Tsarukyan off as he was walking by. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’d like to apologize to Arman for provoking him by flipping him off. I was buzzing all day and the moment got to me,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was my first time attending a live UFC event, and it was absolutely incredible. I’m glad the incident wasn’t as bad as it could have been. I do want to make clear that I didn’t pull him towards me, yell out offensive words or anything of that nature. I flipped him off nothing else. Congrats to Arman on a great performance and best of luck to him against whoever he fights for the title.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/max-holloway-levels-justin-gaethje-epic-knockout-blow-final-seconds-ufc-300-fight&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MAX HOLLOWAY LEVELS JUSTIN GAETHJE WITH EPIC KNOCKOUT BLOW IN FINAL SECONDS OF UFC 300 FIGHT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the post-match press conference, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/dana-white-keeping-bud-light-ufc-beer-sponsor-brilliant-business-move-ex-espn-star-sage-steele-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;White expressed concern&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the UFC might face a potential lawsuit, but Ardon made it clear to the outlet on Monday that he has no plans to seek legal action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Ardon is hoping White might extend him an invitation to the next fight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To answer Dana White’s comments about suing: I will not sue, that never crossed my mind. My first thought was I hope I don’t get kicked out. Thank you Uncle Dana for blessing us with an amazing 300 card… and can you bless me and my brothers up with tickets to UFC 303?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tsarukyan’s record improved to 22-3-0 after defeating Oliveira in a third round decision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
