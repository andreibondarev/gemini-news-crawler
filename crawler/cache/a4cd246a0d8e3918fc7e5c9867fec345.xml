                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chance Perdomo, who starred in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/netflix-series-chilling-adventures-of-sabrina-shocks-with-underage-orgy-scene&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and &quot;Gen V,&quot; has died. He was 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to Fox News Digital on Saturday, a representative for the actor confirmed that he died in a motorcycle accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On behalf of the family and his representatives, it is with heavy hearts that we share the news of Chance Perdomo’s untimely passing as a result of a motorcycle accident,&quot; the statement read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Authorities have advised that no other individuals were involved,&quot; it continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;His passion for the arts and insatiable appetite for life was felt by all who knew him, and his warmth will carry on in those who he loved dearest. We ask to please respect the family&apos;s wish for privacy as they mourn the loss of their beloved son and brother.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other details about the accident were immediately available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perdomo most recently played Andre Anderson on the first season of &quot;Gen V,&quot; the college-centric spin-off of Amazon Prime’s hit series &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/meg-ryan-slams-nepo-baby-label-regarding-her-son-boys-star-jack-quaid-jack-really-talented&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;The Boys,&quot; &lt;/a&gt;set in a universe where superheroes are celebrities — and behave as badly as the most notorious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His character was a student at Godolkin University, founded by the sinisterly omnipresent Vought International corporation, where &quot;supes&quot; train; his power involved the manipulation of metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perdomo starred alongside Jaz Sinclair, Lizze Broadway, Maddie Phillips, London Thor, Derek Luh, Shelley Conn and Asa Germann in the series, which premiered last September. According to Deadline, production on season two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;of &quot;Gen V&quot; &lt;/a&gt;will be postponed following Perdomo&apos;s passing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to People Magazine, the producers of &quot;Gen V&quot; said, &quot;We can’t quite wrap our heads around this. For those of us who knew him and worked with him, Chance was always charming and smiling, an enthusiastic force of nature, an incredibly talented performer, and more than anything else, just a very kind, lovely person.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even writing about him in the past tense doesn’t make sense. We are so sorry for Chance’s family, and we are grieving the loss of our friend and colleague,&quot; the continued. &quot;Hug your loved ones tonight.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Amazon MGM Studios and Sony Pictures Television shared a statement to People, writing, &quot;The entire Gen V family is devastated by the sudden passing of Chance Perdomo.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Amazon MGM Studios and Sony Pictures Television extend our heartfelt thoughts and support to Chance&apos;s family and all who loved him at this difficult time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2018 to 2020, Perdomo starred as Ambrose Spellman, the cousin and sidekick of series lead Sabrina Spellman (Kiernan Shipka) in the Netflix supernatural horror series &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.&quot; He played Landon in the last three installments of the &quot;After&quot; film series, including &quot;After We Fell,&quot; &quot;After Ever Happy&quot; and &quot;After Everything.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Deadline, Perdomo was born in Los Angeles but raised in Southampton, England. Per the outlet, he initially planned to study law but decided to pursue a career in acting instead. Perdomo made his acting debut in a 2017 episode of the hit British children&apos;s drama series &quot;Hetty Fetter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perdomo&apos;s last project was the upcoming independent movie &quot;Bad Man,&quot; in which he co-starred alongside &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/seann-william-scotts-breakout-american-pie-role-only-earned-8000-worked-zoo-after-film&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Seann William Scott,&lt;/a&gt; Rob Riggle and Johnny Simmons. According to Deadline, production on the action comedy wrapped in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A five-legged lamb, named Spider-Lamb, got a second chance at life after a Mississippi woman provided lifesaving medical help and a forever home.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/pets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;five-legged lamb&lt;/a&gt;, named Spider-Lamb, got a second chance at life after a Mississippi woman took him in just in time for the Easter holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He is definitely one loved lamb by everyone who sees him,&quot; Natalie Renot told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renot, who is passionate about rehabilitating animals that need a helping hand, said that Spider-Lamb was in rough shape when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;she rescued him&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My vet didn’t think he was going to pull through,&quot; Renot said. &quot;He was infested with maggots, and he had a bad infection and an extremely high fever, but he pulled through!!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/new-york-animal-rescue-surrendered-bloodhound-dog-looking-home-meet-duke&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NEW YORK ANIMAL RESCUE SAYS SURRENDERED BLOODHOUND DOG IS LOOKING FOR A NEW HOME: MEET DUKE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renot said that the adorable sheep will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;undergo hernia surgery&lt;/a&gt; in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unfortunately, the hernia has to be corrected because his intestines are inside his testicles and that’s why they are so massive,&quot; Renot explained. &quot;It’s not something he can live with for a while.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/easter-nears-world-changed-truth-resurrection-rev-franklin-graham&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS EASTER NEARS, OUR WORLD CAN BE CHANGED ONLY BY THE TRUTH OF THE RESURRECTION, SAYS REV. FRANKLIN GRAHAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We scheduled his surgery for the end of April to let it heal completely, so he&apos;ll be healthy for his hernia surgery,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The little lamb is now spending his days on Renot&apos;s 40-acre farmland &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/mississippi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Biloxi&lt;/a&gt;, learning how to navigate life with all five legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;His fifth leg will stay,&quot; Renot said. &quot;It doesn’t get in his way at all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renot said that she began rehabilitating animals, like Spider-Lamb, seven years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It started off with cats first and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/agriculture&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;with farm animals&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; Renot said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that helping animals is one of the &quot;most rewarding&quot; things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s stressful, it’s depressing, it’s losing a lot of sleep, but it’s also the most rewarding thing to give up your time to get an animal the opportunity to live,&quot; Renot said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Kate Middleton conspiracy theories exploited by Russian disinformation campaign to amplify agenda: university</title>
                    
                    <description>Dozens of accounts linked to a Russian disinformation group contracted by the Kremlin were amplifying conspiracy theories about Kate Middleton&amp;apos;s health, according to researchers.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-middletons-health-buckingham-palace-grapples-conspiracy-theories&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; that took over social media amid Kate Middleton’s mystery health situation — before she revealed her cancer diagnosis last week — were amplified by Russian disinformation campaigns, according to security researchers at Cardiff University in Wales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there was legitimate concern for the Princess of Wales’ health and her whereabouts while she was recovering from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-middleton-hospitalized-surgery-expected-stay-2-weeks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;planned abdominal surgery&quot;&lt;/a&gt; in January, and privately beginning chemotherapy treatments, Kremlin contractors were also taking advantage of the frenzy around the royal to promote pro-Russian and anti-Ukrainian narratives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have a long-term program of research looking at disinformation and information manipulation online and what we did in this particular case was we were monitoring the traffic around the story about the Princess of Wales and we noticed some unusual spikes in the traffic,&quot; Professor Martin Innes, Cardiff University&apos;s Security, Crime and Intelligence Institute director, told ABC Australia radio host Patricia Karvelas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innes said when their researchers looked into the spikes more closely, &quot;we saw some unusual patterns of activity and behavior on a number of accounts that we recognized from having looked at a particular Russian disinformation group before.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/queen-camilla-says-kate-middleton-thrilled-accepts-touching-sign-two-young-fans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QUEEN CAMILLA SAYS KATE MIDDLETON WILL BE ‘THRILLED’ AS SHE ACCEPTS TOUCHING SIGN FROM TWO TOUNG FANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, &quot;The group in question has been around for several years now, and it’s quite well-known in the open-source research community. What they were doing in this particular example was they were taking advantage of the massive amount of interest that there was in the story.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said rather than posting original content themselves about the princess’ health, &quot;they would find popular posts, and then they would reply to those posts, inserting their own content into the comments and replies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continued, &quot;Typically, the content would either be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;denigrating Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; and celebrating Russia’s achievements in the war or talking up the integrity of the recent Russian election.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-middletons-cancer-announcement-video-featured-symbol-hope-fight-against-disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATE MIDDLETON&apos;S CANCER ANNOUNCEMENT VIDEO FEATURED SYMBOL OF HOPE IN FIGHT AGAINST DISEASE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest in Middleton’s health turned into a frenzy soon after Kensington Palace announced on Jan. 17, that the princess had undergone a &quot;planned abdominal surgery&quot; and would postpone her public engagements until Easter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quell the rumor mill, on March 10, the princess posted a photo of herself with her children, wishing Brits a happy Mother’s Day. News agencies like the Associated Press deemed the photo to be &quot;manipulated&quot; and pulled it, saying it didn’t meet their journalistic standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-william-simmering-over-kate-middleton-health-speculation-bound-to-crack-expert&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRINCE WILLIAM ‘SIMMERING’ OVER KATE MIDDLETON HEALTH SPECULATION, IS ‘BOUND TO CRACK’: EXPERT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Middleton’s admission that she sometimes likes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-middleton-apologizes-confusion-around-edited-family-photo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;experiment with editing,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; the photo further inflamed already out-of-control conspiracy theories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rumors only began to die down after the princess delivered a video message on March 22 that she had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-middleton-announces-cancer-undergoing-chemotherapy-treatment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;diagnosed with cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innes told NBC News and The New York Times, that the researchers had identified 45 social media accounts that were linked to the Russian disinformation group Doppelgänger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted that the group didn’t start any of the conspiracy theories, but rather seized on them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s not as though these Russia-linked accounts were driving the story; they were jumping on it,&quot; he told NBC News. &quot;It was already being framed in conspiracy terms, so foreign actors don’t need to set that frame — that’s already there to exploit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innes explained that replying to posts rather than creating original content is strategic because it makes it harder for social media platforms to regulate their comments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They obviously have an ideological agenda, but what’s interesting about this group is they’re not part of the state security services, which is some of the actors we’ve been seeing behind other disinformation campaigns,&quot; he told ABC Australia. &quot;They are commercial organizations contracted by the Kremlin to deliver social media messaging for them a bit like sort of a dark PR firm.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innes explained that along with an ideological agenda, the campaigners also want to get paid. He said they would try to meet their &quot;performance indicators&quot; by &quot;jumping on popular stories and hijacking those.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said, &quot;Not only did they manage to kind of push the narratives they want, they’re also interested in fulfilling their contract, and it’s an ideal and quite easy way for them  to hit their performance targets.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innes told NBC News that the group’s focus is on &quot;destabilization&quot; and &quot;undermining trust in institutions&quot; such as government, the monarchy and media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The amount of attention on the story of the Princess of Wales has been enormous and so, just by inserting your messages and jumping on certain hashtags like that you can, particularly if you&apos;re persistent and keep going with it, you can get a lot of eyeballs and a lot of attention to some of the messaging that you want to put across,&quot; he told ABC Australia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wales-based researchers also identified dark PR firms working out of Pakistan, Indonesia, and other countries, using the frenzy around the princess to amplify ther own agendas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And this is quite a regular occurrence now, really every hot political, celebrity story tends to attract this kind of attention,&quot; he warned. &quot;It’s almost like they function as magnets for people who want to grow their number of followers and get attention for the messages they want to put across.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Blue Jays&apos; Génesis Cabrera&apos;s shoves Rays&apos; José Caballero, sparking benches-clearing confrontation</title>
                    
                    <description>The 2024 Major League Baseball season is just a few days old, the the league has already experienced its second bench-clearing incident in as many days.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emotions ran high late in Saturday&apos;s game between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/toronto-blue-jays&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Toronto Blue Jays&lt;/a&gt; and Tampa Bay Rays. Blue Jays pitcher Génesis Cabrera got into a heated verbal exchange with Rays infielder José Caballero at the end of the seventh inning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three-day-old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; season has now seen two scuffles over the past two days. Players spilled out of each dugout during Friday&apos;s game between the Mets and Brewers, after Milwaukee&apos;s Rhys Hoskins slid hard into second base during a double-play attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday&apos;s altercation turned physical when Cabrera shoved Caballero, prompting both team&apos;s benches to empty. Shortly before the confrontation, Caballero&apos;s bunt single drove in a run. But, he continued around the bases after third baseman Justin Turner made a throwing error. Toronto outfielder George Springer ran down the errant throw and threw to the shortstop, who then tagged Caballero out at third base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cabrera, who was backing up third base, and Caballero came together as the play concluded and exchanged words. The confrontation ensued, although no punches were thrown. Cabrera was eventually ejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mets-pitcher-ejected-throwing-behind-rhys-hoskins-earlier-benches-clearing-incident&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;METS PITCHER EJECTED FOR THROWING BEHIND RHYS HOSKINS AFTER EARLIER BENCHES-CLEARING INCIDENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I saw the ball in the bullpen and started running. The coach is waving at me to go to third. When I got to third, I see Bichette had the ball already, so I gave myself up. I’m kind of slowing down and Cabrera comes out of nowhere and kind of tags me. But there’s no play, I’m already out,&quot; Caballero said. &quot;I just asked him, why did you push me? He didn’t say a word. He just came up to me and pushed me again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dust-up came two innings after the Rays’ Randy Arozarena celebrated his solo homer by kissing his bat, doing a cross-arm pose and then signing autographs for fans after returning to the dugout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I will say it was more like the heat of the moment,&quot; Cabrera said through a translator. &quot;I mean, I think we all kind of overreact a little bit. I mean, he kind of looked at me and I just react. ... It’s part of the game sometimes, but it’s over with. It’s where it ends, right there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rays manager Kevin Cash thought Caballero handled the situation well by not doing anything to escalate the confrontation. &quot;Both teams didn’t let it get out of hand,&quot; Cash said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blue Jays manager John Schneider agreed. &quot;It was handled really well by everyone, umpires and Tampa, and us,&quot; Schneider said. &quot;It was kind of just one of those things where it just kind of happened and they issued warnings and everyone was fine with that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As thousands of Pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in Times Square earlier in the day for &quot;Palestinian Land Day,&quot; they took their protest to the Easter Vigil service &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;at St. Patrick&apos;s cathedral in New York City&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/roman-catholic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;During the second reading,&lt;/a&gt; chants of &quot;Free, free Palestine&quot; could be heard ringing out during the service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protesters were quickly taken out of the service moments after, as many in attendance did not acknowledge the outburst. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/roman-catholic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The mass was led by Cardinal Timothy Dolan,&lt;/a&gt; archbishop of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-demands-biden-issue-apology-over-blasphemous-trans-visibility-day-easter-sunday-appalling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP DEMANDS BIDEN TO ISSUE APOLOGY OVER &apos;BLASPHEMOUS&apos; TRANS VISIBILITY DAY ON EASTER SUNDAY: &apos;APPALLING&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All over the world, millions gathered Saturday to protest the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) issued a call for prayer for peace in the Middle East and an end to the Israel-Hamas war in a statement before the start of Holy Week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/us-catholic-bishops-request-prayers-peace-israel-ahead-holy-week&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US CATHOLIC BISHOPS REQUEST PRAYERS FOR PEACE IN ISRAEL AHEAD OF HOLY WEEK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/lent-and-life&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;As the Church enters Holy Week&lt;/a&gt; and Christ’s suffering on the cross and his resurrection are made present to us so vividly, we are connected to the very source of hope,&quot; the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the war in Israel, the USCCB has consistently issued calls for peace, prayer, fasting and the release of hostages captured by Hamas. The conference has also decried the deaths of civilians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thousands of innocent people have died in this conflict, and thousands more have been displaced and face tremendous suffering,&quot; the bishops said. &quot;This must stop.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Christine Rousselle contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former MTV reality star Connor Smith has been arrested after spending 13 months on the run, evading authorities who launched a nationwide manhunt for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 33-year-old, who was a cast member on season three of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;MTV&apos;s dating show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Are You The One?&quot; in 2015, was wanted on three felony charges, including traveling to meet a minor for a sexual encounter, grooming and disseminating harmful material. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2023, a warrant for Smith was issued in Lake County, Illinois. He was taken into custody by the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office at 15163 George Blvd. in Clearwater, Florida, on Thursday, according to a charge report posted on the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcsoweb.com/InmateBooking/SubjectResults.aspx?id=1959635&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; office&apos;s website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith was booked into the Pinellas County Jail that same day at 2:01 p.m. local time, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to an affidavit obtained by People magazine, Smith did not have any weapons on him at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the time of his arrest.&lt;/a&gt; The affidavit further stated that Smith did not appear to be under the influence of drugs and there were no signs of mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/nationwide-manhunt-underway-former-mtv-star-allegedly-tried-have-sexual-encounter-with-teenager&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NATIONWIDE MANHUNT UNDERWAY FOR FORMER MTV STAR WHO ALLEGEDLY TRIED TO HAVE SEXUAL ENCOUNTER WITH MINOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last February, the Lake County Sheriff&apos;s Department issued a media release, which described Smith as having corresponded with a female undercover detective who was pretending to be under the age of 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the release, &quot;Smith sent ‘the child’ sexually explicit images and videos of himself. Smith then made arrangements to meet the ‘girl’ for a sexual encounter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sheriff&apos;s department says Smith had been in communication with &quot;the girl&quot; for several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

Detectives moved in to apprehend him, however he was able to &quot;escape and fled in his vehicle.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nationwide arrest warrant was then filed for Smith, with a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/illinois&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; Lake County Judge &lt;/a&gt;setting bond on the warrant at $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith previously told authorities that he would surrender himself to them, but he failed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith had previously been accused of inappropriate behavior towards a minor in 2021. He was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;arrested&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and charged with rape, sexual battery and two counts of criminal confinement, according to court documents obtained by Us Weekly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to The Times of Northwest Indiana, the charges were dropped in Sept. 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/in-court&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;An attorney for Smith&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said at the time that they were &quot;pleased with the outcome and glad we were able to vindicate our client of these horrible false charges.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, attorney Maryam Afshar-Stewart told the media, &quot;Unfortunately, these type of accusations, despite a dismissal, carry consequences that are far-reaching. . . . While a dismissal is a step in the right direction, Mr. Smith has a long road ahead to repair the damage that has been caused by these false allegations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Caroline Thayer contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Maine airport offers its visitors a rare chance to &apos;visit&apos; the moon</title>
                    
                    <description>Travelers to Portland International Jetport, Maine&amp;apos;s largest airport, can now take a trip to &amp;quot;visit&amp;quot; the moon thanks to a new exhibit called &amp;quot;Fly Me to the Moon.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Maine&apos;s largest airport has a new &quot;destination&quot; to offer its travelers: the moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Portland International Jetport is now home to the second-largest piece of the moon on Earth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The piece is part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/museums-exhibits&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;new exhibit&lt;/a&gt; titled &quot;Fly Me to the Moon,&quot; which opened to the public on March 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/some-schools-cancel-classes-april-8-solar-eclipse-ensure-safety&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOR SOLAR ECLIPSE ON APRIL 8, SOME US SCHOOLS WILL BE CLOSED FOR THE DAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The piece of the moon is on loan from the Maine Mineral &amp;amp; Gem Museum (MMGM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s joined by a piece of Mars, representing &quot;samples of the most beautiful extraterrestrial substance yet discovered.&quot; The meteorite is &quot;celebrated for its striking resemblance to Edvard Munch&apos;s ‘The Scream,’&quot; said a joint release from the jetport and MMGM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are thrilled to have ‘Fly Me to the Moon’ at the Jetport,&quot; said Paul Bradbury, director of the airport. &quot;We love celebrating unique aspects of Maine, and the MMGM is certainly among them.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darryl Pitt, a music executive from New York City who sourced all the meteorites, said he &quot;loved&quot; the Portland International Jetport, and thought it was an excellent location to &quot;provide a peek at MMGM&apos;s treasures.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/solar-eclipse-2024-where-how-view-rare-orbit-hitting-us&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SOLAR ECLIPSE 2024: WHERE AND HOW TO VIEW THE RARE ORBIT HITTING THE US&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pitt told Fox News Digital that the new exhibit is the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/solar-eclipse-safety-drivers-should-not-do-road-rare-event&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;coolest eclipse&lt;/a&gt; add-on&quot; for anyone who is traveling to the state ahead of the April 8 eclipse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maine is one of the states that will experience &quot;totality&quot; during the upcoming eclipse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And by the way, the largest piece of the moon on our planet is also in Maine!&quot; said Pitt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Maine Mineral &amp;amp; Gem Museum in Bethel has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space/moon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;more of the moon&lt;/a&gt; than all of the natural history museums in the world, combined,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/ancient-shipwrecks-artifacts-dating-early-3000-bc-uncovered-underwater-researchers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANCIENT SHIPWRECKS, ARTIFACTS DATING AS EARLY AS 3000 BC UNCOVERED BY UNDERWATER RESEARCHERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bethel is located in western Maine, about 70 miles northwest of Portland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Maine is not just about lobsters anymore … It’s where the moon lives,&quot; said Pitt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The centerpiece of the new exhibit is a meteorite dubbed &quot;The Scream.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meteorite &quot;says ‘hello!’ and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/travel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;lures travelers&lt;/a&gt; to come closer and check out one of the more fascinating exhibits you will see in any airport in the world,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pieces of the moon and Mars are quite rare, Pitt told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about 3,000 pounds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/inside-moon-mysteries&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the moon&lt;/a&gt; is known to exist on Earth, which includes samples brought back during the Apollo missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All of it would fit in the back of a large SUV,&quot; said Pitt.  &quot;And there are only a half ton of samples of the planet Mars &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/planet-earth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;on Earth.&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot; will be on display for the next five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Cavaliers&apos; Donovan Mitchell still noncommittal on long-term deal despite team owner&apos;s confidence</title>
                    
                    <description>NBA All-Star Donovan Mitchell was noncommittal in response to Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert&amp;apos;s expression of confidence Mitchell would sign an extension with the Cavs.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/cleveland-cavaliers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Cleveland Cavaliers&lt;/a&gt; owner Dan Gilbert recently expressed belief Donovan Mitchell will sign a contract extension with the team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’ve been talking to him, sure, for the last couple of years about extending this contract,&quot; Gilbert said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. &quot;We think he will extend. I think if you listen to him talk, he loves the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Mitchell, who signed a five-year contract with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/utah-jazz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Utah Jazz&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, took a more measured approach when he responded to Gilbert&apos;s comments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I got a lot of things to focus on outside of that right now to be honest,&quot; Mitchell told reporters Saturday. &quot;I gotta focus on myself, getting back [from his knee injury] for this group, focusing on us getting over this stretch, continuing to be ready when it comes time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the NBA&apos;s collective bargaining agreement, the five-time &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NBA All-Star&lt;/a&gt; is eligible to sign a four-year extension this summer. The contract could be worth up to an estimated $200 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nba-coach-threatened-gamblers-sports-betting-brings-distraction-game&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NBA COACH SAYS HE WAS THREATENED BY GAMBLERS, SAYS SPORTS BETTING &apos;BRINGS A DISTRACTION TO THE GAME&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’ll handle that when it comes,&quot; Mitchell said of extension talks. &quot;I’m gonna give you the same answer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/erikslater_/status/1774079923444932825&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW MOMENT ON X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitchell&apos;s response probably stems from the NBA guard&apos;s desire to keep his options open. The 27-year-old is having another standout season, averaging 27.1 points and a career-best 6.1 assists per game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleveland acquired him in a blockbuster trade shortly before the 2022-23 season. The team viewed him as perhaps the final piece to contend for an NBA championship with young stars Darius Garland, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Injuries have limited Mitchell to 49 games this season. Friday&apos;s game against the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/philadelphia-76ers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Philadelphia 76ers&lt;/a&gt; marked Mitchell&apos;s first since March 16. He finished with 12 points in 32 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>The Oklahoma State Patrol said Saturday that it closed a highway south of Sallisaw after a barge struck a bridge over the Arkansas River.</description>

                    <title>UConn uses improbable second-half run to clinch trip to Final Four, continue March Madness dominance</title>
                    
                    <description>The defending champion UConn Huskies continue to own March Madness, using a 30-0 run to earn a trip to the Final Four for the second year in a row.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For the first time in school history, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/connecticut-huskies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;UConn Huskies&lt;/a&gt; are in the Final Four in consecutive years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top-seeded Huskies continued their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk/march-madness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;March Madness&lt;/a&gt; dominance since their national championship last year with a 77-52 victory over third-seeded Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With less than 90 seconds left in the first half, the game was tied at 23, and it looked like the 36-3 Huskies had finally met their match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, UConn then went on a 30-0 run. That&apos;s right — 30-0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that stretch, the Huskies were 12-for-15 from the floor, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/illinois-fighting-illini&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Illinois missed 16 straight shots.&lt;/a&gt; UConn eventually went up by 31 with 11:48 to go, putting yet another game away early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their last 10 March Madness games, UConn has beaten opponents by an average of 23.1 points. The Huskies have won each game by at least 13. This season, their closest game was a 75-58 win over No. 8 Northwestern in the Round of 32. In this tournament, their average margin of victory is 27.8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 7-foot-2 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Donovan Clingan&lt;/a&gt; continued to be a man among boys around the glass, going for a tournament-high 22 points and 10 rebounds. It was his fourth 20-point game this season and his second 20-10 game. Guard Cam Spencer added a dozen boards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/rick-pitino-expects-lethal-uconn-repeat-amid-continued-march-madness-dominance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RICK PITINO EXPECTS &apos;LETHAL&apos; UCONN TO REPEAT AMID CONTINUED MARCH MADNESS DOMINANCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four Huskies (Clingan, Spencer, Alex Karaban and Hassan Diarra) were all in double-digits. Outside of Marcus Domask&apos;s 17, Illinois&apos; next-highest scorers were Terrence Shannon Jr. and Amani Hansberry with eight each. Shannon averaged 23.5 points this season entering the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois shot just 25.4% from the floor in the loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is one bugaboo for UConn, it&apos;s the team&apos;s inconsistent 3-point shooting. The Huskies shot 3-for-17 on Saturday and went 3-for-22 in the Round of 32. But in the first round and the Sweet 16, UConn shot 9-for-24 and 10-for-26, respectively. That all adds up to 22.9%, which isn&apos;t ideal. But the Huskies&apos; have compensated by converting 63.8% of their two-point attempts in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Huskies will face the winner of No. 4 Alabama and No. 6 Clemson, who face off Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A brown bear that injured at least five people in Liptovsky Mikulas, Slovakia, was killed by authorities after a week-long hunt. The killing was controversial among residents.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A brown bear that terrified a small town in Slovakia was recently killed by authorities after a week-long search in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Central European&lt;/a&gt; country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The town of Liptovsky Mikulas declared a state of emergency after a bear was spotted running through suburban areas on March 20. The mammal attacked five residents, including a 10-year-old girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Footage shows &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the bear&lt;/a&gt; running down multiple streets before jumping into a river and swimming into the distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Liptovsky Mikulas officials announced the death of the bear, which has been identified as male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/video-shows-moment-bear-emerges-home-being-shot-paintball-gun&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIDEO SHOWS MOMENT BEAR EMERGES FROM UNDER HOME AFTER BEING SHOT AT WITH PAINTBALL GUN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;According to the Minister of the Environment Tomáš Taraba, the bear, which injured five people in several places in the center and on the Quay, was eliminated by the emergency team yesterday at 21:50,&quot; the Facebook post, which was written in Slovak, read. &quot;He added, a drone with biometrics was used to identify him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Several patrols [had] been searching for him continuously, day and night until elimination,&quot; the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many residents of the country doubted that the original bear was killed, and believed a smaller female bear was targeted instead. Some speculated that the government lied about the incident ahead of an election on April 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One politician claimed that government documents say a female bear was killed instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;According to documents written by the bear intervention team that we found, a 67-kilogram female bear was caught and killed,&quot; Michal Wiezik, a member of the country&apos;s opposition party, was quoted as saying. &quot;It is not necessary to use high-end biometrics to make it clear that such a shooting cannot be in any way related to the 100-kilogram male they were looking for.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/watch-florida-bear-attacks-takes-reindeer-christmas-decoration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WATCH: FLORIDA BEAR ATTACKS, TAKES OFF WITH REINDEER CHRISTMAS DECORATION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slovaks in Facebook comments sections were divided over the killing, with many doubting their government&apos;s side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Murderers! You murdered a bear that had just woken up from hibernation. He was hungry and looking for food,&quot; one angry social media user wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Slovak took the situation as an opportunity to take a stab at his country&apos;s government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Let&apos;s use common sense, the bear was identified by a drone measuring biometrics, in a country where we can&apos;t even make roads and half of the offices cannot communicate electronically,&quot; he wrote in Slovak. &quot;No one in their right mind can believe a fairy tale about biometrics.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the killing, some residents begged officials to spare the mammal&apos;s life and did not believe he posed a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This young bear, who accidentally entered the city, is terrified because it entered an unknown area… definitely not going back to town after this experience... no point in eliminating a young bear from its life..... let him live,&quot; one user wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The bear was apparently expelled and driven to the city, where it certainly did not change to &apos;wake up and attack&apos; people,&quot; another added. &quot;He was more afraid than everyone else.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one Slovak social media user supported the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We need to further reduce the overpopulated bear population,&quot; the woman wrote. &quot;Not all of us fit in a limited space. People are afraid to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;enjoy nature,&lt;/a&gt; forests and mountains.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the city of Liptovsky Mikulas for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A K-9 unit with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department&lt;/a&gt; was airlifted to a trauma veterinary hospital on Friday after he was stabbed multiple times by a suspect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Belgian Malinois, Enzo, was allegedly stabbed by a barricaded suspect who exited an apartment on South &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/las-vegas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; Boulevard armed with a knife. Enzo was stabbed after biting the suspect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enzo, 2, had been deployed as a nonlethal option when the suspect came closer to officers with the knife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The K-9 was rushed to a veterinary hospital and then airlifted to a veterinary trauma hospital. He is in stable condition, the Police Department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/suspect-shoots-robotic-police-dog-massachusetts-standoff-manufacturer-says-first&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUSPECT SHOOTS ROBOTIC POLICE DOG IN MASSACHUSETTS STANDOFF, MANUFACTURER SAYS IT&apos;S A FIRST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will remain in the hospital’s intensive care unit overnight, continuing to receive treatment, the Police Department said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/massachusetts-police-k9-tracks-scent-2-miles-find-missing-12-year-old-freezing-cold&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MASSACHUSETTS POLICE K9 TRACKS SCENT FOR OVER 2 MILES TO FIND MISSING 12-YEAR-OLD IN FREEZING COLD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Saturday update, police said, &quot;Enzo is feeling better today.

                    <title>UFL kicker praises God after drilling game-winning 64-yard field goal in first attempt since high school</title>
                    
                    <description>Jake Bates had not attempted a field goal since high school, but he drilled a 64-yarder in the final seconds in his United Football League debut.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ufl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jake Bates&lt;/a&gt; played three college football seasons as a kicker, but he was used exclusively on kickoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That meant, even as a kicker, he never attempted an extra point or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-fb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;field goal in college.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, naturally, he drilled a 64-yard field goal with just two seconds left to give the UFL&apos;s Michigan Panthers an 18-16 win over the St. Louis Battlehawks Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bates was first a soccer player, earning an All-District first team nod while attending Tomball High School in Texas, and he parlayed that into two seasons of soccer at Central Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he turned to football in 2020 after transferring to Texas State. After two years there, he transferred again to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/arkansas-razorbacks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;University of Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, where, in 2022, he earned first-team All-SEC honors as a &quot;kickoff specialist,&quot; according to the Razorbacks&apos; website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Bates signed with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/houston-texans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Houston Texans&lt;/a&gt; as an undrafted free agent but did not make the team out of training camp after converting two extra points in the preseason. He signed with the UFL shortly before the year ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in his first field goal attempt since high school, he had ice in his veins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Panthers trailed 16-15 when Bates came on to attempt a 64-yarder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/XFL2023/status/1774209706522706139&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW MOMENT ON X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Louis had scored a touchdown and taken the lead on a one-point conversion with 49 seconds to go, and Michigan had no timeouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that was plenty of time for Bates and the Panthers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I prepared for this moment. I was ready,&quot; Bates &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/XFL2023/status/1774212118780244006&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;told FOX after the game&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;When you have a lot of faith in your guys, man, nothing is (impossible with) God. He is risen. Easter weekend, man. It&apos;s a really special feeling.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Battlehawks tried icing Bates by calling their final timeout, giving the kicker a warmup attempt. Bates drilled that and the one that counted moments later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game was played at Ford Field, home of the NFL&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/detroit-lions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Detroit Lions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Caitlin Clark&apos;s strong performance lifts Iowa to Elite 8, sets up rematch with defending champion LSU</title>
                    
                    <description>Caitlin Clark is making the most of her final appearance in the NCAA tournament. Iowa prevailed Saturday to advance to its third Elite Eight in the past six years.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Caitlin Clark, the presumptive top pick in the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/caitlin-clark-announces-decision-enter-2024-wnba-draft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WNBA Draft&lt;/a&gt;, delivered another impressive performance in Iowa&apos;s Sweet 16 matchup with the fifth-seeded Colorado Buffaloes Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark&apos;s 29 points led &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/iowa-hawkeyes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Hawkeyes,&lt;/a&gt; and she added 15 assists as Iowa cruised to an 89-68 win. Saturday&apos;s victory sets up a rematch of last year’s national title game against LSU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think we’re excited. Anytime you have a chance to go up against somebody you lost to, it brings a little more energy,&quot; Clark said. &quot;I think overall it’s just going to be a really great game for women’s basketball. They’re really solid, one through five. We know we are going to have to rebound the basketball.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lsus-kim-mulkey-shrugs-off-piece-released-ahead-of-sweet-16-profiling-rifts-during-career-havent-read-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kim Mulkey&lt;/a&gt; coached LSU to the program&apos;s first-ever national title last year. The Tigers defeated Iowa 102-85 in the championship game. The teams are scheduled to play Monday, and the winner will clinch a spot in the Final Four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think everyone’s pretty excited for it,&quot; Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said. &quot;These are two really good basketball teams. … Everyone that’s left now is really good. LSU is certainly that. It’s going to be highly emotional and highly competitive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lsus-angel-reese-says-fiery-handshake-incident-started-bruins-assistant-coach-talking-little-crazy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LSU&apos;S ANGEL REESE SAYS FIERY HANDSHAKE INCIDENT STARTED WITH BRUINS ASSISTANT COACH &apos;TALKING A LITTLE CRAZY&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark got the Hawkeyes going early, driving to the basket for easy layups or throwing fantastic passes. About the only thing missing from Clark’s day was one of her signature midcourt shots. She took a couple but didn&apos;t convert any.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NCAA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/iowas-caitlin-clark-reflects-breaking-ncaa-scoring-record&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;all-time Division I scoring leader&lt;/a&gt; has dazzled off the court as well. She’s a transcendent player who has brought record ratings and attendance to the sport. Clark spent a few minutes after the buzzer signing autographs before she retired to the locker room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark threaded the needle with a beautiful bounce pass to Hannah Stuelke for a layup before the end of the first quarter that gave the Hawkeyes a 22-14 lead. Clark had six points, six assists and three rebounds in the opening 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We had the punch to begin the third quarter,&quot; Bluder said. &quot;Set the tone early in both the halves, which was really important.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/colorado-buffaloes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Buffaloes&lt;/a&gt; made their first back-to-back trips to the Sweet 16 since 2002-03. They also were knocked out last year by Iowa, falling 87-77 in the same round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is tough. Never want to go out like that,&quot; Colorado’s Jaylyn Sherrod said. &quot;Some things we can all look back at and say we could have done better. Proud of this team.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>LSU&amp;apos;s star players delivered stellar performances in the Sweet 16. Flau&amp;apos;jae Johnson and Angel Reese recorded double-doubles to lift the Tigers to the Elite Eight.</description>

Angel Reese finished the game with 16 points and 11 rebounds to record her 26th double-double of the season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LSU trailed 67-64 with 2:46 remaining in the fourth quarter but went on a 14-2 run to close out the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LSU will play in the Elite Eight for a second consecutive season and will face &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/iowas-caitlin-clark-receives-pathbreaking-offer-ice-cubes-big3she-readies-turn-pro&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Caitlin Clark&lt;/a&gt; and the Iowa Hawkeyes. LSU defeated Iowa in last season&apos;s national championship game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LSU led by seven points at halftime. But after making just two of their first 20 shots from 3-point range, the Bruins hit four of their next five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lsus-kim-mulkey-shrugs-off-piece-released-ahead-of-sweet-16-profiling-rifts-during-career-havent-read-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LSU&apos;S KIM MULKEY SHRUGS OFF PIECE RELEASED AHEAD OF SWEET 16, PROFILING RIFTS DURING CAREER: &apos;HAVEN&apos;T READ IT&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consecutive 3-pointers from Londynn Jones keyed an 11-2 run that gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/ucla-bruins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;UCLA the lead&lt;/a&gt; at 45-44, and the teams were tied at 48 headed into the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson had two early 3-pointers in the first half. Her spinning baseline drive and layup highlighted an 8-0 LSU spurt that put the Tigers up 25-18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bruins made just one of 16 shots from behind the arc before Jones’ 3-pointer from the left wing just before the halftime buzzer. That ended an 8-0 LSU run and cut what had been a 10-point lead to 34-27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LSU is looking to become the first team in NCAA Division I women&apos;s basketball to win back-to-back national titles since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/connecticut-huskies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;UConn Huskies&lt;/a&gt; won its fourth straight championship in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bruins have made 19 NCAA Tournaments and have been in the Sweet 16 nine times, including three in the last four years. But they have advanced to just two regional finals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>The Albuquerque Police Department shared bodycam video of one of its mounted officers pursuing a stubborn shoplifting suspect on horseback. Mark Chacon, 30, was arrested.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/new-mexico&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; police officers recently pursued a suspected shoplifter on horseback, bodycam footage shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Albuquerque Police Department published video of the March 20 incident on Facebook on Friday. In a post, the department explained that its mounted unit was nearby when its officers heard a commotion about a recent robbery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suspect Mark Chacon, 30, allegedly stole $230 worth of merchandise from a Walgreens location. He was later charged with eluding/evading police on foot, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;shoplifting and&lt;/a&gt; possession of drug paraphernalia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodycam video shows the perspective of a mounted officer who was approaching the drugstore on horseback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/dashcam-video-shows-cement-truck-plowing-texas-school-bus-killing-boy-man&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DASHCAM VIDEO SHOWS CEMENT TRUCK PLOWING INTO TEXAS SCHOOL BUS, KILLING BOY AND MAN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Go get him! Go get him!&quot; a woman was heard saying in the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Did he steal something?&quot; the officer asked, to which the woman replied, &quot;Yes!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stop! Albuquerque police! You are being detained!&quot; the police officer then yelled out while pursuing Chacon, who was running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/driver-dead-fiery-crash-new-york-school-bus-returning-field-trip-video&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DRIVER DIES IN FIERY CRASH WITH NEW YORK SCHOOL BUS RETURNING FROM FIELD TRIP: VIDEO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make the situation even more bizarre, the exhausted suspect ran slowly into moving traffic — forcing the officer on horseback to follow. Vehicles on the road slowed down in response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dejected, Chacon then walked back onto the sidewalk before any vehicles got close to running them over. He turned back into the highway when two other officers on horseback cornered him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Get on the ground!&quot; an officer repeatedly yelled. &quot;You are being detained, get out of the road!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspect eventually relented and was placed in handcuffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Albuquerque Police Department&lt;/a&gt; for more information.

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Family, friends, and a sea of blue uniforms gathered for the funeral of slain New York Police Department &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6349820142112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Officer Jonathan Diller&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mourners filled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/roman-catholic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; and crowded the areas outside as a funeral Mass was celebrated for the 31-year-old officer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/tunnel-towers-barstool-step-help-family-slain-nypd-officer-leaves-behind-wife-1-year-old&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Diller’s widow&lt;/a&gt;, Stephanie Diller, received a standing ovation when she approached the church lectern to deliver her remarks. Fighting back tears, Diller thanked the public for the outpouring of support following her husband&apos;s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am so proud that thousands of people across the country are calling Johnathan a hero, but the truth is that he&apos;s always been a hero to Ryan and me,&quot; she said. &quot;The rest of the world is just catching up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also demanded change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How many more police officers and how many more families have to make the ultimate sacrifice before we start protecting them?&quot; Stephanie questioned. She later closed her eulogy, saying, &quot;When the gates of Heaven open for me, I hope I will see Jonathan standing there, looking at me like he did on our wedding day. Rest in peace, Jonathan Diller, the man who captured my heart and now all of New York’s.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/nypd-jonathan-diller-shooting-suspect-guy-rivera-charged-murder-attempted-murder-attack-officers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NYPD JONATHAN DILLER SHOOTING: SUSPECT GUY RIVERA CHARGED WITH MURDER, ATTEMPTED MURDER IN ATTACK ON OFFICERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York City Mayor Eric Adams also commended Diller as a hero during his remarks at the service, recalling the final moments of the officer&apos;s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even after he had been shot […] he fought, and took the gun away from the person who would take his life,&quot; Adams recounted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor vowed to ensure the city would be made more safe, saying &quot;making sure that violent career criminals are held accountable for their crimes, and doing all we can to end gun violence in this city.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban announced that Diller had been posthumously promoted to detective — with a badge number to honor his son Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;His new badge number is 110, his son’s birthday,&quot; Caban explained. &quot;What Diller loved most was being Ryan’s dad.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mets-pay-tribute-slain-nypd-officer-jonathan-diller-opening-day&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;METS PAY TRIBUTE TO SLAIN NYPD OFFICER JONATHAN DILLER ON OPENING DAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick Hendry, president of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York&lt;/a&gt;, struggled to keep from crying as he spoke out against the two suspects accused of shooting Diller during a traffic stop and commended the NYPD&apos;s &quot;hero.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/people-heard-clapping-ny-gov-hochul-abruptly-leaves-slain-nypd-officers-wake-after-just-ten-minutes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NY GOV.

Kathy Hochul appeared at his wake briefly before leaving after speaking with a man outside the funeral home. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>LSU&apos;s Angel Reese says fiery handshake incident started with Bruins assistant coach &apos;talking a little crazy&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>LSU star Angel Reese said Saturday an assistant coach with the UCLA Bruins was &amp;quot;talking a little crazy,&amp;quot; prompting a fiery handshake incident.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/lsu-tigers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;LSU star Angel Reese&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says the commotion on the handshake line after the Tigers’ 78-69 win over UCLA in the Sweet 16 Saturday stemmed from an assistant coach &quot;talking a little crazy.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadcast cameras caught the tense moment when Reese appeared to say something to someone in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/ucla-bruins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the UCLA line.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial speculation was that Reese exchanged words with Bruins head coach Cori Close, who appeared to take offense to something Reese said toward the UCLA bench after she fouled out of the game with 30 seconds remaining. But she clarified that her words were directed at an assistant coach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh no, she told me ‘good game,’&quot; Reese said of Close when asked about the incident during LSU’s postgame press conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was another coach talking a little crazy.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;When asked to explain further&lt;/a&gt;, Reese replied with &quot;Next question.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lsus-kim-mulkey-shrugs-off-piece-released-ahead-of-sweet-16-profiling-rifts-during-career-havent-read-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LSU&apos;S KIM MULKEY SHRUGS OFF PIECE RELEASED AHEAD OF SWEET 16, PROFILING RIFTS DURING CAREER: &apos;HAVEN&apos;T READ IT&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trouble seemingly began when Reese fouled out in the final minute of the game. As she made her way to the bench, she looked over her shoulder and appeared to say something toward the UCLA bench. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fired-up Close approached an official about it and was reportedly upset a technical foul was not called. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That’s just not who we are,&quot; Close said of Reese’s accusations after the game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don’t want to say anything about Angel. I will only speak to what the Bruins are, and the Bruins are classy, speaking life into each other. And we are not gonna give that any – we would never do that, and especially, it would never come from one of my coaches … absolutely not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flau’jae Johnson had 24 points and 12 rebounds, and Reese put up her 26th double-double of the season to get LSU closer to a second straight title. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Kate Winslet on filming &apos;absurd&apos; sex scenes in new show with co-star who &apos;wanted to scare the s---&apos; out of her</title>
                    
                    <description>Kate Winslet discussed filming &amp;quot;absurd&amp;quot; sex scenes with her co-star Matthias Schoenaerts in the new political satire miniseries &amp;quot;The Regime.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Kate Winslet shared her thoughts on filming &quot;absurd&quot; sex scenes for her new political satire miniseries &quot;The Regime.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the HBO show, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/titanic-star-kate-winslet-says-being-famous-was-horrible&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;48-year-old actress&lt;/a&gt; played Chancellor Elena Vernham, the authoritarian leader of a fictitious European country. As her tyrannical regime starts to crumble, the paranoid Elena makes disgraced soldier Herbert Zubak (Matthias Schoenaerts) her new confidant and the pair embark on a twisted love affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a recent interview with The Times, the &quot;Titanic&quot; star recalled that her raunchy sex scenes with Schoenaerts were &quot;so much fun to film&quot; that at one point, the cinematographer and the make-up artist had to leave the set because they were laughing too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s satire,&quot; Wislet said. &quot;Nothing makes sense and it’s so absurd, all you can do is laugh your head off.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winslet noted that Elena and Herbert&apos;s passionate love scenes occasionally turned volatile, pointing to one particular scene in which her character screams &quot;No biting&quot; at her lover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-winslet-titanic-25th-anniversary-james-cameron-traumatized&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;KATE WINSLET TALKS &apos;TITANIC&apos; 25TH ANNIVERSARY AS JAMES CAMERON SAYS SHE WAS &apos;TRAUMATIZED&apos; BY THE FILM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told the Times that intimacy coordinators were present on set, but their guidance was rarely needed. Winslet explained that she and Schoenaerts had established a strong working relationship after previously playing lovers in the 2014 period drama &quot;A Little Chaos,&quot; which was directed by the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/harry-potter-star-late-alan-rickman-wanted-quit-franchise-journals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; late Alan Rickman.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To be honest, Matthias and I know each other so we have a shorthand and a trust that we’ve had for over a decade,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Schoenaerts told the Times that he didn&apos;t hold back while filming violent scenes between Herbert and Elena as well as confrontations with his character&apos;s nemesis, imprisoned former chancellor Edward Keplinger (Hugh Grant).&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You don’t want to break any bones, but at the same time you want to scare the s--- out of [your fellow actors] and make them think you can kill them,&quot; Schoenarts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winslet&apos;s last television role was in the 2017 HBO crime drama &quot;Mare of Easttown.&quot; The&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/oscars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; Academy Award winner &lt;/a&gt;said that she embraced the opportunity to take on a comedic role after acting in a string of projects that dealt with more serious themes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Being ridiculous was such a breath of fresh air,&quot; she said. &quot;I’ve dabbled with comedy in the past. I thought, ‘If I get to do something funny one day, then lucky me — but if it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winslet continued, &quot;But this show was hysterical. There was a lot of improvising and having fun. We didn’t get through a scene without wetting ourselves laughing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-winslet-thinks-ozempic-sounds-terrible-confesses-past-eating-disorder&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.K. native&lt;/a&gt; said she was &quot;overjoyed&quot; to find that the story of &quot;The Regime&quot; was centered on a complex female lead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;Times have changed, in the last ten years even more than the ten years previously. I think this time it is a movement, with so many female-driven pieces and women learning how to use their voices differently creatively,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We don’t have to just be strong and loud all the time,&quot; she added. &quot;You can’t do any of that unless you are able to get into the vulnerable side too. We see where Elena’s demonic strength comes from and what is underneath.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winslet also weighed in on whether she was able to better relate to her character, who is surrounded by sycophantic yes-men, due to her own celebrity status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No! I’m very good at spotting people who want to please me and it makes me deeply uncomfortable,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’ve become rather good at just doing things my way — without meaning to sound in any way self-congratulatory,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;The Regime&quot; &lt;/a&gt;is currently airing on HBO and is available to stream on MAX.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Duke star Jared McCain recently went viral for his painted fingernails during March Madness, and he parlayed that into an NIL deal with beauty brand Sally Hansen.</description>

It helps me not bite my nails. I went to a salon one time, and I decided to pick out a color. And I thought it looked nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know a lot of people disagree. You don&apos;t like it. But I&apos;m just gonna be myself and do what I think looks nice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/rick-pitino-expects-lethal-uconn-repeat-amid-continued-march-madness-dominance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RICK PITINO EXPECTS &apos;LETHAL&apos; UCONN TO REPEAT AMID CONTINUED MARCH MADNESS DOMINANCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCain says he&apos;s continued to paint his nails because he&apos;s played well in games they had color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m not crazy superstitious, but I thought it looked nice.

                    <title>Connecticut becomes one of last states to allow in-person early voting</title>
                    
                    <description>Connecticut is now one of 46 states where early voting is allowed, which was held a week before Tuesday&amp;apos;s presidential primary.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Connecticut has become one of the last holdout states to allow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/voting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;early in-person voting&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the state’s presidential primary on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday was the last day for early voting before Tuesday, which was marked by low turnout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 13,476 voters out of both Democrats and Republicans in the state came out to cast an early ballot. There are around 1.2 million voters registered for both parties in the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/with-eye-toward-2024-election-republicans-make-big-push-early-voting-2023&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WITH EYE TOWARD 2024 ELECTION, REPUBLICANS MAKE BIG PUSH FOR EARLY VOTING IN 2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voters passed a constitutional amendment in 2022 by 60% for the initiative, and the Senate last year approved a bill to allow 14 days of early voting for the general election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a historic moment for Connecticut,&quot; Stephanie Thomas, Secretary of the State, said in a statement after early voting began last Tuesday. &quot;We now have so many more opportunities for people to go out and vote.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added, &quot;We asked voters to help us test the system and make their voices heard, and voters of Connecticut answered the call.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state has strict requirements to be eligible to vote by absentee ballot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Republicans had been concerned about voter security connected to early voting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lara-trump-says-rnc-must-use-legal-ballot-harvesting-first-time-stay-competitive-against-democrats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LARA TRUMP SAYS RNC MUST USE ‘LEGAL BALLOT HARVESTING’ FOR FIRST TIME TO STAY COMPETITIVE AGAINST DEMOCRATS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Peggy Roberts, the Republican registrar of voters in Stonington, said the rollout has been &quot;organized and secure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voters &quot;like the fact that they’re not having to stand in line,&quot; she said. &quot;In every town there’s a few people who think that it’s easy to cheat and they’re seeing that it’s not easy to cheat. It’s very organized and secure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a voter casts an early ballot in the state, they’re immediately marked as having voted in the Centralized Voter Registration System to prevent cheating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts added that looking up voters in the computer database has been time-consuming and may need to be streamlined before the general election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republican voter JoLynn Brochu, who voted early, worried there’s &quot;Too much opportunity for cheating,&quot; with the new system, but chose to do it anyway because, &quot;I know Democrats take that opportunity at a much higher rate than Republicans do. So I think it’s important for Republicans to start doing the same thing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four states — Alabama, Delaware, Mississippi and New Hampshire — still don’t allow early voting. Delaware previously allowed early voting, but it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/court-strikes-down-early-voting-law-bidens-home-state-little-bit-irony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ruled unconstitutional in February.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Trump demanded an apology from Biden and the White House, calling their declaration &amp;apos;Transgender Day of Visibility&amp;apos; on Easter Sunday, &amp;quot;appalling&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;blasphemous.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;After President Biden&lt;/a&gt; sparked fury by declaring March 31 &quot;Transgender Day of Visibility,&quot; which this year is also Easter Sunday, former President Trump called for an immediate apology to millions of Christians and Catholics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, called it &quot;appalling and insulting&quot; that Biden &quot;formally proclaimed Easter Sunday as ‘Trans Day of Visibility.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leavitt said the president&apos;s announcement is an example of the Biden administration&apos;s &quot;years-long assault on the Christian faith.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We call on Joe Biden&apos;s failing campaign and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the White House&lt;/a&gt; to issue an apology to the millions of Catholics and Christians across America who believe tomorrow is for one celebration only — the resurrection of Jesus Christ,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/churches-lgbtq-groups-celebrate-transgender-day-visibility-easter-sunday-drag-me-to-church&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIBERAL CHURCHES CELEBRATE TRANSGENDER DAY OF VISIBLITY ON EASTER THIS YEAR: ‘DRAG ME TO CHURCH’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leavitt said the Biden administration&apos;s move comes after the White House banned religious egg designs in its Easter Art Event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The art contest is part of the White House’s Easter traditions, which include the annual Easter Egg Roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flier for the contest states that an Easter egg design submission &quot;must not include any questionable content, religious symbols, overtly religious themes, or partisan political statements.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While March 31 has been designated to honor the transgender movement since Biden took office, this year it falls on Easter Sunday, one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/christianity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;most important days&lt;/a&gt; for Christians, as they celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On Transgender Day of Visibility, we honor the extraordinary courage and contributions of transgender Americans and reaffirm our Nation’s commitment to forming a more perfect Union — where all people are created equal and treated equally throughout their lives,&quot; a statement released by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the White House&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-slammed-social-media-announcing-transgender-day-visibility-easter-sunday&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN SLAMMED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER ANNOUNCING TRANSGENDER DAY OF VISIBILITY ON EASTER SUNDAY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today, we send a message to all transgender Americans:  You are loved.  You are heard.  You are understood.  You belong.  You are America, and my entire Administration and I have your back,&quot; it continued. &quot;NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 31, 2024, as Transgender Day of Visibility.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s call for an apology from Biden came after prominent politicians and conservative commentators declared outrage over the ‘Transgender Day of Visibility’ on the most solemn Christian holiday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Biden White House has betrayed the central tenet of Easter — which is the resurrection of Jesus Christ,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mike-johnson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;House Speaker Mike Johnson&lt;/a&gt; posted on X. Banning sacred truth and tradition—while at the same time proclaiming Easter Sunday as &apos;Transgender Day&apos;—is outrageous and abhorrent. The American people are taking note.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caitlyn Jenner, former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete, wrote on X that the &quot;only thing you should be declaring on this day is ‘HE is Risen’.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am absolutely disgusted that Joe Biden has declared the most Holy of Holy days - a self proclaimed devout Catholic - as Transgender Day of Visibility,&quot; Jenner wrote. &quot;The only thing you should be declaring on this day is ‘HE is Risen’.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s eldest son, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/t/donald-trump-jr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Donald Trump Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, wrote on X: &quot;This is the left&apos;s new religion. They want people worshiping the trans flag instead of God. They must be stopped.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/easter-march-31-this-year-why-many-christians-wake-sunrise-celebrate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;EASTER IS MARCH 31 THIS YEAR. HERE&apos;S WHY MANY CHRISTIANS WILL WAKE UP BEFORE SUNRISE TO CELEBRATE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former presidential candidate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/vivek-ramaswamy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vivek Ramaswamy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; called Biden out on X, formerly Twitter, writing, &quot;Joe Biden just proclaimed that ‘Transgender Visibility Day’ is on Sunday, March 31st. I wonder how he came up with that date.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Alex Mooney, R-W.Va., echoed Ramaswamy&apos;s sentiments as he blasted Biden for the &quot;coincidence on the timing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-skewered-worlds-worst-catholic-cheapens-irish-catholic-identity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN SKEWERED AS &apos;WORLD’S WORST CATHOLIC&apos; WHO CHEAPENS IRISH AND CATHOLIC IDENTITY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Joe Biden has proclaimed Easter Sunday as ‘Transgender Day of Visibility,’&quot; Mooney wrote on X. &quot;What a coincidence on the timing, right? This is a direct assault on Christianity. Yet another attack on religion and traditions by this administration.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tennessee Republican&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Rep. Diana Harshbarger said the announcement was &quot;intentional&quot; and slammed it as a &quot;blatant disregard.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a direct assault on Christianity. It’s evident the left is determined to undermine our religion and traditions,&quot; she wrote on X. &quot;This isn’t just blatant disregard, it’s intentional.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentator Benny Johnson shared a screenshot of the White House statement, writing alongside it, &quot;What a slap in the face to all Christians in America…&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News&apos; has reached out to the Trump campaign and the Biden Administration for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Haley Chi-Sing and Anders Hagstrom contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The New York Yankees &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;debuted new uniforms&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that excluded the white piping that outlined the words &quot;New York&quot; and the jersey numbers that had been on their road jerseys since 1973.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design change was made after Major League Baseball changed the material of its jerseys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new jerseys got flak in spring training by some players criticizing the &quot;cheap&quot; look of smaller last names on the backs of jerseys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yanks don&apos;t have last names on their jerseys, but even their uniforms look a mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yanks opened their season in Houston, and players have been sweating bullets through their jerseys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jerseys are getting plenty of attention. Boomer Esiason and Gregg Giannotti of WFAN, the radio network that broadcasts Yankees games, ripped them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m watching the game, and I’m thinking, ‘Damn, those uniforms, they just look so plain,’&quot; Esiason said Friday. &quot;You could see the sweat. They are awful. … I’ve never seen guys sweat through the uniforms like that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I had forgotten about [the jerseys] for a while,&quot; Gio responded. &quot;But they’re terrible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mets-pitcher-ejected-throwing-behind-rhys-hoskins-earlier-benches-clearing-incident&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;METS PITCHER EJECTED FOR THROWING BEHIND RHYS HOSKINS AFTER EARLIER BENCHES-CLEARING INCIDENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yankees?src=hashtag_click&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;#Yankees&lt;/a&gt; need to swap Fanatics jerseys because of sweat on March 29, I can’t even imagine what it’s going to be like during a July day game in the Bronx…,&quot; wrote Forbes Creative and Design VP &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MattyHerrmann/status/1773887103052488726&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Matt Herrmann&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The sweat stains on everyone because of the Fanatic jersey debacle is a disgrace,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JakeAsman/status/1773721478346797517&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;ESPN&apos;s Jake Asman&lt;/a&gt; added. &quot;I saw the Astros names on the back in person yesterday and it looked horrible. Yankees saving grace is that they don’t do the last names so it doesn’t look bad besides the sweat.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GaryHPhillips/status/1773876943093440635&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Yankees beat writer Gary Phillips&lt;/a&gt; said Carlos Rodon on Friday &quot;[looked] like he was sprayed with a fire hose despite pitching in a climate controlled stadium.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During spring training, there were viral photos of tucked-in jerseys visible through pants and pants &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/giants-players-photo-new-mlb-jersey-viral-revealing-how-tight-pants-really-are&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;revealing a bit too much.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denis Nolan, MLB&apos;s senior vice president of global consumer products, maintained the uniforms are &quot;world-class.&quot; Another global consumer exec, Stephen Roche, said they were &quot;performance-driven.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The league&apos;s website notes this year&apos;s jerseys have 25% more stretch compared to last year&apos;s, prompting several players to praise the lighter feel. The league tested the uniforms on hundreds of players, debuting them at last year&apos;s All-Star Game to favorable reviews. Fanatics measured every player last year, and Nike scanned the bodies of over 300 players to get the ideal fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A grandmother was granted emergency custody of her 4-year-old grandchild just days before the child was reported missing and later found dead, court documents reveal.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Court records show the grandmother &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/missing-persons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;of a missing 4-year-old Washington state boy&lt;/a&gt; was granted emergency custody of him after telling a judge that his mother was a threat and was not able to care for him, days before he was reported missing and later found dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 25, Maria Garcia, the grandmother of Ariel Garcia, filed for &quot;emergency minor guardianship,&quot; alleging that the child&apos;s mother &quot;has a long history of alcohol and substance abuse that has gotten worse in the last few months,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fox13seattle.com/news/everett-child-missing-found-dead&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;FOX 13&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court documents obtained by the news station also revealed that Maria Garcia said her daughter’s behavior is &quot;very violent and unpredictable&quot; and asked the court to give limited or no visitation to the child&apos;s mother, citing physical child abuse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ariel was last seen nearly two days after the court filing. Police said he was missing under &quot;suspicious circumstances&quot; with a family member. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/alaska-mothers-disappearance-investigation-haunts-locals-people-know-happened&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALASKA MOTHER&apos;S DISAPPEARANCE, INVESTIGATION STILL HAUNTS LOCALS: &apos;THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington State Patrol issued an endangered missing person alert for Ariel in the early hours of March 28, several hours after he was last seen, and the Everett Police Department launched a regional search effort involving nearly 100 officers, agents and investigators from multiple jurisdictions, including the FBI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before 6 p.m. on Thursday, Everett police were notified that a body &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/washington&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;had been located along an interstate in Pierce County.&lt;/a&gt; Detectives responded to the location and were able to confirm the deceased was Ariel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am completely heartbroken for the family and friends of Ariel Garcia, and they will remain in my thoughts as they grieve this unbelievably tragic loss,&quot; Everett Mayor Cassie Franklin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/missing-tennessee-teen-sebastian-rogers-mother-defends-leaving-neighborhood-after-threatening-messages&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISSING TENNESSEE TEEN SEBASTIAN ROGERS&apos; MOTHER DEFENDS LEAVING NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER ‘THREATENING’ MESSAGES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, the Everett police arrested Janet Garcia, Ariel’s mother, in Vancouver, Washington, for murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree and assault of a child in the first degree. Police said she was a person of interest and her whereabouts were known early on in the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was initially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;arrested for making a false statement to a public servant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; and booked into the Snohomish County Jail.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A friend told investigators that Ariel and his mother were staying with her, according to FOX 13. When the friend returned home on March 27, she saw a &quot;substantial&quot; amount of blood on the floor, but Ariel and his mother were nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/missing-vermont-teen-brianna-maitland-father-suspects-some-kind-struggle-vanished&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISSING VERMONT TEEN BRIANNA MAITLAND&apos;S FATHER SUSPECTS &apos;SOME KIND OF STRUGGLE&apos; BEFORE SHE VANISHED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When investigators mentioned this to Janet Garcia, FOX 13 reported she allegedly told them that Ariel fell off a bed and hit his head, which is why there was blood on the floor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On behalf of the Everett Police Department, I want to share our condolences with the loved ones of young Ariel Garcia. This is not the outcome we had hoped for,&quot; Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said. &quot;I want to thank all our partners that jumped into action to support this search effort. Our investigation will continue, and we will do everything we can to ensure there is justice for this young boy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Maryland Governor Wes Moore said the conditions remained &amp;quot;unsafe&amp;quot; for rescue divers due to debris and weather following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/maryland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Maryland Gov. Wes Moore&lt;/a&gt; stated Saturday that conditions remain &quot;unsafe&quot; for rescue divers due to weather and debris following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Conditions in the water make it unsafe for rescue divers. And we&apos;re not just talking about weather and wind,&quot; Moore said during a press conference, appearing alongside Baltimore City Mayor Brandon Scott, state police Superintendent Col. Roland Butler, and first responders. &quot;We&apos;re talking about debris, we&apos;re talking about wreckage. We&apos;re talking about pieces of the Key Bridge that are in the water.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are going to ensure the safety of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;first responders&lt;/a&gt; and we are not going to compromise one for the other,&quot; Moore continued. &quot;We are going to do both at the same time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/funding-bill-replace-baltimore-key-bridge-take-shape-matter-weeks-top-house-republican&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUNDING BILL TO REPLACE BALTIMORE KEY BRIDGE COULD TAKE SHAPE IN &apos;MATTER OF WEEKS&apos;: TOP HOUSE REPUBLICAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Right now, the conditions make it unsafe for rescue divers, but as soon as those conditions change, Colonel Butler has assured me that those rescue divers will be going right back in the water,&quot; Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore also said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/army&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Army Corps of Engineers&lt;/a&gt; and its partners would move forward with crane operations Saturday and northern sections of the bridge would be cut up and removed, calling it &quot;a remarkably complicated process.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-maryland-gov-wes-moore-says-there-nothing-we-will-not-do-recovery-efforts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BALTIMORE BRIDGE COLLAPSE: MARYLAND GOV. WES MOORE SAYS ‘THERE IS NOTHING WE WILL NOT DO’ ON RECOVERY EFFORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This will eventually allow us to open up a temporary restricted channel that will help us to get more vessels in the water around the site of the collapse,&quot; Moore said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore also thanked responding agencies as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Biden-Harris Administration&lt;/a&gt; following the collapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight construction workers, all of whom were from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/regions/central-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Central America,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; plummeted into the water after the Dali, a Singaporean-flagged container ship, slammed into the bridge, causing it to collapse. Two were rescued after the collapse. Divers have recovered the bodies of two others, and the other four are presumed dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-senate-candidate-pushes-republicans-rebuild-baltimore-bridge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOP SENATE CANDIDATE PUSHES REPUBLICANS TO REBUILD BALTIMORE BRIDGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dali was en route to Sri Lanka from Baltimore. It is owned by Grace Ocean Private Ltd., and Danish shipping giant Maersk said it had chartered it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vessel was carrying more than 4,000 metal shipping containers, 56 of them with hazardous materials inside. Thirteen of those were destroyed, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Booms were placed to control the spread of any oil that seeped into the water, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/environment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;state environmental officials&lt;/a&gt; were also sampling the water Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Bradford Betz contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
