                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers reacted after Israel reportedly struck a site in Iran early Friday in retaliation for Tehran firing a barrage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/israel-on-alert-as-iran-launches-drones-toward-jewish-state&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;missiles and drones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at Israel last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handful of American politicians defended Israel&apos;s &quot;right to defend itself,&quot; calling for the U.S. to &quot;stand with Israel.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ted-cruz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sen. Ted Cruz,&lt;/a&gt; R-Texas, told Fox News Digital that Israel had a &quot;right and obligation to respond&quot; and blamed the recent attacks on President Biden&apos;s handling of foreign policy in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The scope of Israel&apos;s action tonight shows just how far Iran&apos;s reach has extended across the region. Iran&apos;s advances should worry every American, because when Iran&apos;s leaders chant &apos;Death to Israel&apos; they also chant ‘Death to America,&apos;&quot; Cruz said. &quot;Iran launched a massive attack and act of war against Israel. That attack was enabled because Joe Biden and Biden officials dismantled pressure on the Ayatollah.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-strikes-site-iran-retaliation-weekend-assault&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISRAEL STRIKES SITE IN IRAN IN RETALIATION FOR WEEKEND ASSAULT: SOURCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thankfully, after decades of cooperation with the United States, and thanks to President Trump&apos;s diplomacy in the Middle East, we and our Israeli and Arab allies repelled that attack,&quot; he said. &quot;However, it was still an act of war, and Israel had the right and obligation to respond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Congress should ensure the United States stands unequivocally with our Israeli allies as they do so and reestablish deterrence,&quot; Cruz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Iran&apos;s attack on Israel last weekend, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/marco-rubio&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sen. Marco Rubio&lt;/a&gt;, R-Fla., asked how America would respond if it were attacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If another country targeted America with the single biggest drone attack in history, how would we respond?&quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israels-advanced-military-technology-full-display-during-iran-attack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ISRAEL&apos;S ADVANCED MILITARY TECHNOLOGY ON FULL DISPLAY DURING IRAN&apos;S ATTACK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reports of the Friday attack surfaced, Rubio posted on X: &quot;Israel has the ability to conduct strikes against targets inside Iran without entering Iranian airspace from aircraft over Syrian and Iraqi airspace.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/g/matt-gaetz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz&lt;/a&gt; defended Israel&apos;s reported attack, saying it has the &quot;right to defend itself against Iran&apos;s full network of evil,&quot; while placing blame on the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Iran and its proxies have mounted attacks against Israel for years, and under the Biden administration’s foreign policy, things have only escalated. Israel has a right to defend itself against Iran’s full network of evil,&quot; Gaetz wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wisdom must be displayed,&quot; he said. &quot;A broadening regional war is in the best interest of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/middle-east&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;no Middle Eastern&lt;/a&gt; country – or the United States.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The United States stands with Israel,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/sen-rick-scott&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sen. Rick Scott&lt;/a&gt;, R-Fla, added on X shortly after reports of Israel&apos;s retaliatory attack on Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Fox News Digital confirmed that there have been explosions in the Isfahan province where Natanz – the site of one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/nuclear&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities&lt;/a&gt; – is located, though it is not clear whether it has been hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A well-placed military source has told Fox that the strike was &quot;limited.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Bradford Betz and Jennifer Griffin contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>On this day in history, April 19, 1951, Gen. MacArthur delivers &apos;Old soldiers never die&apos; speech to Congress</title>
                    
                    <description>Gen. Douglas MacArthur delivered his &amp;quot;Old soldiers never die&amp;quot; speech to a joint session of Congress on this day in history, April 19, 1951. Earlier, MacArthur was relieved of his military duties.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gen. Douglas MacArthur delivered his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;farewell address to Congress&lt;/a&gt; on this day in history, April 19, 1951, uttering the famous line, &quot;Old soldiers never die; they just fade away.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight days before the speech, MacArthur had been relieved of his duties as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/army&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;general of the U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt; by President Harry S. Truman — putting an end to his storied military career. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am closing my 52 years of military service,&quot; said MacArthur in the speech, which is available on the Library of Congress website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/this-day-history-april-18-first-self-operated-washateria-opens-fort-worth-texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, APRIL 18, 1934, FIRST SELF-OPERATED ‘WASHATERIA’ OPENS IN FT. WORTH, TEXAS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When I joined the Army, even before the turn of the century, it was the fulfillment of all my boyish hopes and dreams,&quot; he also. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The world has turned over many times since I took the oath at West Point, and the hopes and dreams have all since vanished,&quot; MacArthur said, &quot;but I still remember the refrain of one of the most popular barracks ballads of that day, which proclaimed most proudly that old soldiers never die; they just fade away.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacArthur was referring to an old army ballad, &quot;Old Soldiers Never Die,&quot; said the Library of Congress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And like the old soldier of that ballad, I now close my military career and just fade away, an old soldier who tried to do his duty as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/faith-values&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;God gave him the light&lt;/a&gt; to see that duty,&quot; said MacArthur. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Goodbye,&quot; he then said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacArthur&apos;s dismissal came after repeated clashes with Truman regarding strategy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/this-day-history-sept-15-1950-us-troops-land-inchon-tide-korean-war&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in the Korean War&lt;/a&gt;, according to the website for the PBS documentary series &quot;American Excellence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/this-day-history-march-11-1942-macarthur-leaves-philippines-vows-return&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MARCH 11, 1942, MACARTHUR LEAVES PHILIPPINES, VOWS TO RETURN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general did not approve of Truman&apos;s strategy for the conflict, seeking instead to engage in a more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/asia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;intense war in Asia&lt;/a&gt; in order to stem the spread of communism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No soldier has ever captured the American imagination like Douglas MacArthur. He led Americans into combat for a half-century, through glorious victories and soul-numbing defeats,&quot; said PBS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Courageous and supremely egotistical, he battled anyone who dared question his military judgment — even the president of the United States,&quot; it also said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacArthur, who was born in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/arkansas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Little Rock, Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, in 1880, graduated from the U.S. Military Academy West Point in 1903, as Fox News Digital previously reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1937, MacArthur retired from the U.S. Army. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years later, however, the situation in the Pacific worsened and the then-U.S. Commonwealth of the Philippines was threatened by the ever-creeping Japanese forces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/this-day-history-march-16-1802-united-states-military-academy-established-west-point&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MARCH 16, 1802, UNITED STATES MILITARY ACADEMY ESTABLISHED AT WEST POINT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Franklin Delano Roosevelt plucked MacArthur out of retirement, designating him the general in charge of the newly created United States Army Forces in the Far East, Fox News Digital noted previously. r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While MacArthur served honorably and faithfully, he was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/this-day-history-march-11-1942-macarthur-leaves-philippines-vows-return&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;forced to flee&lt;/a&gt; the Philippines for his own safety on March 11, 1942.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 30, 1942, in Melbourne, MacArthur was presented with the Medal of Honor for &quot;conspicuous leadership in preparing the Philippine Islands to resist conquest, for gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action against invading Japanese forces, and for the heroic conduct of defensive and offensive operations on the Bataan Peninsula,&quot; said the Congressional Medal of Honor Society website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He mobilized, trained and led an army, which has received world acclaim for its gallant defense against a tremendous superiority of enemy forces in men and arms,&quot; that website also noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;His utter disregard of personal danger under heavy fire and aerial bombardment, his calm judgment in each crisis inspired his troops, galvanized the spirit of resistance of the Filipino people and confirmed the faith of the American people in their Armed Forces,&quot; the citation added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1944, 1948 and 1952, Republican groups tried &quot;in vain&quot; to obtain MacArthur’s nomination for the presidency, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;MacArthur accepted the board chairmanship of the Remington Rand Corporation in 1952,&quot; that site notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except for duties connected to his role with Remington Rand and &quot;rare public appearances,&quot; MacArthur &quot;lived in seclusion&quot; in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He died in Washington, D.C., in 1964.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was buried in Norfolk, Virginia, Encyclopedia Britannica also says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Israel early Friday fired missiles at a site in Iran in retaliation for Tehran&amp;apos;s firing a barrage of missiles and drones at Israel over the weekend.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Israel carried out limited strikes in Iran early Friday in retaliation for Tehran firing a barrage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/israel-on-alert-as-iran-launches-drones-toward-jewish-state&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;missiles and drones&lt;/a&gt; at Israel late Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital has confirmed there have been explosions in Isfahan province where Natanz is located though it is not clear whether it has been hit. Natanz is the site of one of Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities, though state television has described all sites in the area as &quot;fully safe.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A well-placed military source has told Fox that the strike was &quot;limited.&quot; Sources familiar said the U.S. was not involved and there was pre-notification to the U.S. from the Israelis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pentagon officials have not confirmed the strike. The White House and the National Security Council (NSC) have declined to comment on the unfolding situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercial flights, meanwhile, began diverting their routes early Friday morning over western Iran without explanation as one semiofficial news agency in the Islamic Republic claimed there had been &quot;explosions&quot; heard over the city of Isfahan, Reuters reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The semiofficial Fars news agency reported on the sound of explosions over Isfahan near its international airport. It offered no explanation for the blast. However, Isfahan is home to a major airbase for the Iranian military, as well as sites associated with its nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dubai-based carriers Emirates and FlyDubai began diverting around western Iran about 4:30 a.m. local time. They offered no explanation, though local warnings to aviators suggested the airspace may have been closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran later announced it grounded commercial flights in Tehran and across areas of its western and central regions. Loudspeakers informed customers of the incident at Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran, online videos purported to show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iranian state television began a scrolling, on-screen alert acknowledging a &quot;loud noise&quot; near Isfahan, without immediately elaborating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran attacked Israel over the weekend in retaliation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-launches-drones-towards-israel-weeks-after-deadly-syria-consulate-strike&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Israel&apos;s deadly strike&lt;/a&gt; on Iran&apos;s consulate earlier this month that killed a dozen people, including a top general. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israels-advanced-military-technology-full-display-during-iran-attack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISRAEL&apos;S ADVANCED MILITARY TECHNOLOGY ON FULL DISPLAY DURING IRAN&apos;S ATTACK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weekend attack by Iran marked a major escalation of violence. Despite decades of hostilities between the two nations, Iran has never directly attacked Israel, instead relying on proxy forces in Iraq, Lebanon and elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a developing story.

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The daughter of U.S. Rep. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ilhan-omar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ilhan Omar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;, D-Minn., &lt;/a&gt;was arrested Thursday at anti-Israel protests at Columbia University, law enforcement sources told Fox News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isra Hirsi was in the custody of the New York Police Department and put into flex cuffs or zip ties and will face trespassing charges, according to sources. She was among more than 100 people issued a summons for trespassing, the NYPD said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hirsi was released hours later from NYPD headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, Hirsi said she was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/ilhan-omars-daughter-suspended-college-amid-anti-israel-activism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;suspended from Barnard College&lt;/a&gt;, located near Columbia, for &quot;standing in solidarity with Palestinians facing a genocide.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/pentagon-spox-whether-us-will-help-israeli-attack-iran-question-israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PENTAGON SPOX ON WHETHER US WILL HELP ISRAELI ATTACK ON IRAN: &apos;THAT’S A QUESTION FOR ISRAEL&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Those of us in Gaza Solidarity Encampment will not be intimidated,&quot; she wrote on X. &quot;We will stand resolute until our demands are met. our [sic] demands include divestment from companies complicit in genocide, transparency of @Columbia’s investments and FULL amnesty for all students facing repression.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/anti-israel-agitators-occupy-columbia-campus-university-president-faces-grilling-congress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dozens of anti-Israel activists&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; began protesting at Columbia University Wednesday morning, creating an encampment on the main lawn in protest of Israel&apos;s war against Hamas. Fiery protests continued into the overnight hours with calls for an intifada and the death of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/radical-pro-palestinian-groups-increasingly-target-houses-worship-protests-alarming-trend&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&apos;RADICAL&apos; PRO-PALESTINIAN GROUPS INCREASINGLY TARGET HOUSES OF WORSHIP FOR PROTESTS IN ALARMING TREND&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Omar questioned Columbia administrators during a congressional hearing on Capitol Hill about anti-Israel activism on the Ivy League campus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the hearing, Omar sounded the alarm about what she called an &quot;attack&quot; with a &quot;toxic chemical substance&quot; at an anti-Israel protest at Columbia University. However, according to court documents, the substance was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/ilhan-omar-questions-college-president-wet-farts-attack-anti-israel-columbia-students&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;non-toxic flatulence spray&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; called &quot;Liquid A--&quot; and &quot;Wet Farts.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital has reached out to Omar&apos;s office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., suggested Hirsi&apos;s suspension was a reprisal for her mother&apos;s questions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/columbia-student-suspended-alleged-fart-spray-attack-during-pro-palestinian-rally-sues-school&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLUMBIA STUDENT SUSPENDED AFTER ALLEGED ‘FART SPRAY’ ATTACK DURING ANTI-ISRAEL RALLY SUES SCHOOL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The day after @IlhanMN questioned Columbia leadership&apos;s commitment to free academic expression, the school suspended her daughter?&quot; Bowman posted online. &quot;It&apos;s clear what is happening here. Our educational institutions should not be in the business of political reprisals.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Hannah Grossman contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>SEAN HANNITY: Biden needs all the help he can get</title>
                    
                    <description>Fox News host Sean Hannity reveals shocking details about President Biden&amp;apos;s past as he hits the campaign trail for the 2024 election on &amp;quot;Hannity.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News host Sean Hannity calls out President Biden’s gaffes ahead of the 2024 election on &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hannity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEAN HANNITY: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Biden is a lot of things at this point in his life, but sharp as a knife isn&apos;t exactly one of them. In fact, Joe has never been regarded as sharp as a knife his entire career. A serial plagiarizer, who cheated in law school, still finished near the bottom of his class. A short time later, he became a very mediocre &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/young-democratic-voter-admits-regrets-voting-biden-frankly-embarrassed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;senator from Delaware&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; who made friends with, let&apos;s see, a former Klansman. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-asked-bluntly-thinks-trouble-pa-reporter-cites-trump-signs-area&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN DISMISSES REPORTER SEEING &apos;A LOT OF TRUMP SIGNS&apos; IN PA: &apos;YOU&apos;RE DRIVING IN THE WRONG PLACES, PAL&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(He) toed the party line, no matter what, even if that meant working with segregationists to stop the integration of public schools or at least slow it down. He didn&apos;t want public schools, in his words, to become racial jungles.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now he is an empty suit, wearing maximum stability sneakers, who does basically whatever his radical staff is telling him to do. They tell him what to read, what to say, where to go, where to stand, where to sit and when to walk away from the press, which is always. This is why Donald Trump is sitting in a courtroom, as unfair as that is, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bidens-false-cannibal-story-described-simple-misstatement-off-details-media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Biden can&apos;t win&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; on his own. He needs all the help he can get, even if that does mean burning down America&apos;s system of justice in the process. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Fetterman scolds Dem colleagues for failing to condemn Iran&apos;s attack on Israel</title>
                    
                    <description>Senator Fetterman slammed his Democratic colleagues for their refusal to condemn Iran for its attack on Israel in retaliation for the deadly bombing of its Syrian consulate.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., on Thursday slammed his Democratic colleagues for their refusal to condemn Iran for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/irans-failed-attack-israel-pretty-telling-tehrans-capabilities-dod&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;attack on Israel&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation for the deadly bombing of its Syrian consulate earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I sincerely thought I’d never witness members of my party refuse to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;condemn Iran&lt;/a&gt; – one of the world’s leading terrorism sponsors – after launching hundreds of drones against our special ally, Israel,&quot; Fetterman wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. &quot;No words.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a dozen House Democrats on Thursday voted against a resolution condemning Iran for firing a barrage of rockets at Israel over the weekend. U.S. officials said 99% of those were intercepted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move, in retaliation for Israel’s attack on its consulate in Damascus, signified a major escalation of tensions amid Israel’s ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;war with Hamas.&lt;/a&gt; Despite decades of hostilities, Iran has never directly attacked Israel, instead relying on proxy forces in Iraq, Lebanon, and elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/nypd-columbia-university-remove-zip-tied-anti-israel-protesters-president&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NYPD ARRESTS 108 PEOPLE AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AFTER ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS SET UP ENCAMPMENT ON CAMPUS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday’s resolution condemning Iran overwhelmingly passed 404 to 14. Thirteen Democrats voted against the resolution including &quot;Squad&quot; member Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.; Cori Bush, D-Mo.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y.; and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just one House Republican, Rep. Thomas Massive, R-Ky., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/13-dems-vote-against-resolution-condemning-iran-after-israel-strike&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;voted against the bill.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel&apos;s war on Hamas began after militants from the pro-Palestinian terror group invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 and killed more than 1,000 people. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians, has said over 30,000 Palestinians have died in the months since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Oct. 7, Fetterman has repeatedly irked his Democratic colleagues with his fervent support for Israel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Fetterman said he would never &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/sen-fetterman-president-biden-us-response-iran-attacks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;capitulate to the fringe&quot;&lt;/a&gt; of his party. On Tuesday, he ripped anti-Israel agitators who blocked bridges or major roadways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don’t know who needs to hear this, but blocking a bridge or berating folks in Starbucks isn’t righteous, it just makes you an a---hole,&quot; Fetterman wrote on X. &quot;Demand Hamas to send every hostage back home and surrender.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital’s Elizabeth Elkind contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Pittsburgh Pirates veteran reliever Aroldis Chapman has been suspended two games by MLB after he had a heated argument with a home plate umpire who ejected him.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MLB announced&lt;/a&gt; veteran reliever Aroldis Chapman has been suspended two games after his heated argument with a home plate umpire who ejected him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/pittsburgh-pirates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; pitcher Aroldis Chapman has received a two-game suspension and an undisclosed fine for his inappropriate actions in the bottom of the eighth inning of Monday night’s game against the New York Mets at Citi Field,&quot; Michael Hill, MLB senior vice president for on-field operations, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unless appealed, the suspension of Chapman is scheduled to begin on Friday, when the Pirates are to host the Boston Red Sox at PNC Park. If Chapman elects to file an appeal, then the discipline will be held in abeyance until that process is complete.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapman’s Pittsburgh Pirates were playing the New York Mets when he was pitching in the bottom of the eighth inning at Citi Field. Mets outfielder Harrison Bader hit a double that gave the Mets a lead, and it stood as the game-winning hit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapman clearly didn’t like how home plate umpire Edwin Moscoso was calling balls and strikes, and he said something to Moscoso when he went to get a baseball from his catcher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bizarre-snowstorm-showers-pirates-home-opener-vs-orioles-pnc-park&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIZARRE SNOWSTORM SHOWERS OVER PIRATES&apos; HOME OPENER VS ORIOLES AT PNC PARK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscoso waited a few seconds before tossing Chapman from the game, and that’s when things got more heated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapman got in Moscoso’s face, and the two went back and forth before the southpaw eventually retreated to the dugout to accept his fate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether Chapman plans to appeal his suspension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapman, 36, is in his first season with the Pirates, who signed him to a one-year pact worth $10.5 million in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;free agency&lt;/a&gt;. The man whose fastball can reach triple digits on the radar gun is playing for his fourth team in three seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last season, Chapman ended up with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/texas-rangers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt; after playing earlier in the season with the Kansas City Royals. The Rangers won the World Series over the Arizona Diamondbacks, giving Chapman his second World Series ring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapman has a 4.76 ERA in nine appearances for the Pirates this season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Rashida Tlaib says colleges punishing anti-Israel students protesting &apos;genocide&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib criticized American colleges over the response to anti-Israel protests that have targeted Jewish students.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;U.S. Rep. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/rashida-tlaib&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rashida Tlaib&lt;/a&gt;, D-Michigan, criticized American universities on Thursday for responding to anti-Israel protests on campuses across the country where protesters have engaged in antisemitic behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;From UM to Vanderbilt to USC to Columbia, students across our country are being retaliated against for using their constitutional rights to protest genocide. It’s appalling,&quot; Tlaib wrote on X in response to a post by Isra Hirsi, the daughter of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hirsi said she was suspended from New York City&apos;s Barnard College hours before being arrested and later released for protesting against Israel at Columbia University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tlaib, who has Palestinian roots, has frequently criticized Israel and its leaders over its war with Hamas following the terror group&apos;s deadly Oct. 7 attack on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Israeli communities&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/activist-who-spurred-death-america-chants-called-israels-absolute-annihilation-unearthed-video&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACTIVIST WHO SPURRED ‘DEATH TO AMERICA’ CHANTS CALLED FOR ISRAEL&apos;S ‘ABSOLUTE ANNIHILATION’ IN UNEARTHED VIDEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our country isn’t just complicit in this genocide — we’re actively participating in it,&quot; she wrote Thursday on X, while calling on the Biden administration to stop supplying the Jewish state with arms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Tlaib&apos;s concerns over campus responses to student protests, she has refused to call out the antisemitism seen at some gatherings in which Jewish students have been targeted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protests at multiple universities have seen anti-Israel supporters call for an &quot;intifada,&quot; or uprising, and for the destruction of the Jewish state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tlaib&apos;s remarks about Palestinians amid the Israel-Hamas war have sometimes resulted in criticism from fellow Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, she referenced the popular &quot;from the river to the sea&quot; phrase, referring to the area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, which encompasses Israel. Jewish groups say the phrase is antisemitic and a code for the eradication of Israel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rashida-tlaib-accuses-israel-intentionally-killing-7-humanitarian-aid-workers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;RASHIDA TLAIB ACCUSES ISRAEL OF INTENTIONALLY KILLING 7 HUMANITARIAN AID WORKERS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;From the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate,&quot; she wrote. &quot;My work and advocacy is always centered in justice and dignity for all people no matter faith or ethnicity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics have said Tlaib&apos;s stance on Israel, her calls for a ceasefire and her silence of the targeting of Jewish students on college campuses are antisemitic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She drew scorn from her congressional colleagues days after Hamas&apos; Oct. 7 attack on Israel for her statement on that matter. Tlaib said she grieved the loss of both Palestinian and Israeli lives, but then appeared to blame the Israeli government for the unprovoked attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tlaib has long accused Israel of committing genocide and refused to apologize for saying Israel targeted a hospital in Gaza with an airstrike despite U.S. defense officials saying the rocket was fired by terrorists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The failure to recognize the violent reality of living under siege, occupation, and apartheid makes no one safer,&quot; she said. &quot;No person, no child anywhere should have to suffer or live in fear of violence. We cannot ignore the humanity in each other. As long as our country provides billions in unconditional funding to support the apartheid government, this heartbreaking cycle of violence will continue.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tlaib&apos;s office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>LAURA: Alvin Bragg and Judge Merchan are intent on inflicting harm against Trump</title>
                    
                    <description>Fox News host Laura Ingraham says Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg and Judge Juan Merchan are inflicting harm on &amp;quot;the faith that we&amp;apos;re supposed to have in our justice system.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News host Laura Ingraham breaks down jury selection in the Trump New York hush money case on &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Ingraham Angle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; saying the prosecution seems &quot;intent on inflicting harm&quot; against the former president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LAURA INGRAHAM&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Together, the names &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-analyst-says-trump-wouldnt-convicted-non-blue-area-case-relies-known-liar-michael-cohen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bragg &amp;amp; Merchan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; sound like a slip-and-fall firm. You know, the kind that lives off filing personal injury claims, workers&apos; comp cases against alleged wrongdoers, but what we&apos;re learning today shows us that Bragg and Merchan should be the ones on the defensive here, because both seem intent on inflicting harm — harm against Trump and harm against the faith that we&apos;re supposed to have in our justice system. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-asked-bluntly-thinks-trouble-pa-reporter-cites-trump-signs-area&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN DISMISSES REPORTER SEEING &apos;A LOT OF TRUMP SIGNS&apos; IN PA: &apos;YOU&apos;RE DRIVING IN THE WRONG PLACES, PAL&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now, if you&apos;re wondering why in our almost 250-year history we hadn&apos;t ever put a &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/young-democratic-voter-admits-regrets-voting-biden-frankly-embarrassed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;president&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; or a former president on trial, the comments from dismissed jurors should answer the question. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;They started off the day going in the wrong direction with the jury selection, going from seven jurors to five, dismissing two who had already been chosen, but then seven additional jurors were seated, making it a full jury. They have one alternate, and the goal is to get five more. Whether any of those jurors may yet be dismissed or step aside tomorrow is anyone&apos;s guess. Now, even the press jabbering about this case concedes how problematic this is. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Tom Brady posts video of himself running shirtless after saying he&apos;s &apos;not opposed&apos; to NFL return</title>
                    
                    <description>Tom Brady may be serious about this whole unretirement thing. He posted a video of himself running sprints shirtless on his Instagram story.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/julian-edelman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Julian Edelman&lt;/a&gt; was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tom-brady&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Tom Brady&lt;/a&gt; said he was &quot;not opposed&quot; to an NFL return if a team needed him to fill in for an injured quarterback, his former teammate told Fox News Digital he didn&apos;t think Brady was serious about a return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A video Brady posted on Instagram suggests otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the &quot;Deep Cuts&quot; podcast, Brady was asked if he would &quot;pick up the phone&quot; if someone called looking for a quarterback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m not opposed to it,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tom-brady-not-opposed-nfl-comeback-always-good-shape&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brady said with a smile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;I don’t know. … I’m always going to be in good shape, always be able to throw the ball. So, to come in for a little bit, like MJ coming back, I don’t know if they’d let me, but I wouldn’t be opposed to it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&apos;s just a total coincidence, but Brady posted a video of himself shirtless running sprints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PatsBuzz/status/1780998727727022351?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1780998727727022351%7Ctwgr%5E5fd9190d55927f3a718e4204f81340ed449ad6cd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2024%2F04%2F18%2Fsports%2Ftom-brady-has-still-got-it-24-years-later-in-shirtless-video-running%2F&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APP USERS CAN VIEW VIDEO HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;24 years later..,&quot; the future Hall of Famer wrote, tagging his Nobull company. &quot;No excuses. Show up for yourself so you can show up all damn day!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His first retirement lasted 40 days before he pulled a 180 and returned. When he retired a second time, he said he was hanging up the cleats &quot;for good.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/julian-edelman-pours-cold-water-tom-brady-comeback-talk-but-gives-1-hypothetical&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JULIAN EDELMAN POURS COLD WATER ON TOM BRADY COMEBACK TALK BUT GIVES A HYPOTHETICAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&apos;t the first time Brady has hinted at a second return from retirement. In August, Brady took a selfie with his shirt off, looking like he could get under center and saying he was &quot;thinking about finding a training camp to show up to.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of months earlier, he said he was &quot;certain I’m not playing again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’ve tried to make that clear, and I hate to continue to profess that because I’ve already told people that lots of times,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brady spent 20 of his 23 NFL seasons with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-england-patriots&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New England Patriots.&lt;/a&gt; He played his final three with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He won six of his titles in New England and one more in Tampa Bay, cementing himself as the greatest quarterback ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Former ‘Dancing’ pro Cheryl Burke says being ‘breadwinner’ in marriage with Matthew Lawrence didn’t work</title>
                    
                    <description>&amp;quot;Dancing with the Stars&amp;quot; alum Cheryl Burke said she was earning more than Matthew Lawrence during their marriage, and it hurt their relationship.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; pro &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dwts-star-cheryl-burke-says-maks-chmerkovskiy-apologized-fat-shaming-body-hard-to-accept&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Cheryl Burke&lt;/a&gt; learned some important lessons during her marriage to Matthew Lawrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an appearance on the &quot;Amy &amp;amp; T.J. Podcast&quot; with Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes, Burke explained that she has been working on healing from past relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to Lawrence, she said, &quot;I learned that you can&apos;t buy love.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I tried to not, obviously. I didn&apos;t buy my ex-husband, but, like, I definitely would say I was the breadwinner,&quot; she said. &quot;Like, I supported us, and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s black and white.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cheryl-burke-admits-showmances-3-dwts-partners-names-1-dancing-intimate-contact-sport&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHERYL BURKE ADMITS TO &apos;SHOWMANCES&apos; WITH 3 &apos;DWTS&apos; PARTNERS, NAMES 1: DANCING IS AN &apos;INTIMATE CONTACT SPORT&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke said it wasn’t a conscious decision, but she admitted, &quot;I just thought the control, me being the person who controls … it&apos;s like — it made me feel good, but then it didn&apos;t necessarily make the relationship good.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 39-year-old also noted she’s uncertain how to handle the issue in a potential future relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As much as I say do I want someone who takes care of me, I just don’t know if I do,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The professional dancer first met Lawrence in 2006 when Lawrence’s brother, Joey Lawrence, appeared on &quot;Dancing with the Stars.&quot; They broke up in 2008 after dating for a year but reconnected in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple tied the knot in 2019 but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dancing-with-the-stars-pro-cheryl-burke-files-divorce-matthew-lawrence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;divorced in 2022.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same year, Burke also left &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; after 16 years on the show, earning two mirrorball trophies and six appearances in the finals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Burke told Fox News Digital leaving the show was &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cheryl-burke-explains-dancing-with-the-stars-curse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the worst breakup&lt;/a&gt; I&apos;ve ever been through.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the &quot;Amy &amp;amp; T.J. Podcast,&quot; she reiterated the sentiment when asked about her &quot;two divorces&quot; in 2022, saying leaving &quot;DWTS&quot; was &quot;hands down&quot; harder than ending her marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke made it clear the divorce wasn’t easy either, but leaving the show was more difficult because &quot;that was my identity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cheryl-burke-talks-breakup-dancing-with-the-stars-rehab-rumors-future-tv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHERYL BURKE TALKS &apos;BREAKUP&apos; WITH &apos;DANCING WITH THE STARS,&apos; REHAB RUMORS, AND HER FUTURE ON TV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added the show gave her a &quot;voice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I never thought I could be my own independent woman back then,&quot; she said. &quot;Ballroom is very much, it’s a partnership, and it’s always the men that are in control still. I know it sounds so old school, but that’s also the beauty of ballroom. The man leads, the woman follows, and you produce such beautiful art. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m not saying it happens for everyone, but for me, it was very much like that. So, for me, coming into my own and being able to stand on my own two feet, I credit ‘Dancing with the Stars’ with that. And I think because they’ve seen me through it all … it’s hard.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke now hosts a podcast&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dancing-with-the-stars-pro-cheryl-burke-show-saved-life&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; looking back at the show,&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Sex, Lies &amp;amp; Spray Tans.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for her romantic life, the San Francisco-born star isn’t interested in dating now but has some idea of what she’s looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want someone who wants to evolve, like, that wants to consistently and wants to, like, work on himself, be able to take accountability when needed,&quot; she said. &quot;Because, like, you can blame all day long, but at the end of the day, you&apos;re stuck with you for the rest of your freaking life. You better like yourself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke also said she wants someone who is &quot;supportive&quot; and not overly confident but &quot;worthy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Confidence is just, I believe, ego, like, comes from, like, the foundation of maybe a little ego,&quot; she said. &quot;We all have one, right? But to really be OK with who he is, I think that foundation is so important. And communication.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke added a prospective partner must &quot;smell good and look good,&quot; joking &quot;that might seal the deal for me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The podcaster is clear about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cheryl-burke-calls-out-unnamed-cheating-found-text-messages-viagra-necklace&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;what she doesn’t want.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Someone who blames people, someone who is super indecisive. If you can’t order dinner, I just can’t. And that was my first and last date that I was on since my divorce. Like he couldn’t order dinner,&quot; she joked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke did not disclose when the date took place, but it was set up by a mutual friend of hers and her date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rep for Lawrence did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital&apos;s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Senior Air Force officials told U.S. lawmakers that they are &amp;quot;out of time&amp;quot; to meet the threats of China, advocating for modernization in the military.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Senior Air Force officials &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;told U.S. lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; that they are &quot;out of time&quot; in modernizing their forces to meet the threats of China and other adversaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/tech/air-force-secretary-plans-ride-ai-operated-f16-aircraft-spring&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Department of the Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall&lt;/a&gt; and top-ranking military leaders from the Air Force and Space Force shared their chilling warning to a House committee on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Time is my greatest concern — we are in a race for military technological superiority with a capable pacing challenge,&quot; Kendall told the House Armed Services Committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our cushion is gone — we are out of time,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/talk-low-houthi-weapon-supply-premature-expert-warns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TALK OF LOW HOUTHI WEAPON SUPPLY IS ‘PREMATURE,&apos; EXPERT WARNS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 9, Kendall, alongside &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;other top military brass&lt;/a&gt;, warned that &quot;time cannot be recovered&quot; after the current year’s budget was finalized in March 2024, instead of Oct. 1, 2023, when the fiscal year began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As you are aware, the six-month delay has had a real impact. That time cannot be recovered, but at least we can now move forward with our urgent modernization priorities,&quot; Kendall said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veering from his prepared remarks, Kendall used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-announces-new-sanctions-iran-attack-israel-pressure-continue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Iran&apos;s recent attack&lt;/a&gt; on Israel as a timely example of the U.S. need for preparation against possible future attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What Iran encountered was a highly contested environment. And what we face with China is a highly contested environment,&quot; Kendall told the committee of the April 13 attack, in which nearly every one of the weapons launched against Israel was intercepted by a coalition that included the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What I’m dedicated to — and what we’re all dedicated to here — is ensuring that the U.S. never has a result like Iran had in its attempt to attack Israel,&quot; Kendall said. &quot;That’s what’s driving a lot of what we’re doing and why it’s so important to move on from legacy systems that weren’t designed for that type of environment to ones that are designed for it and are capable of coping with that.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kendall, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David W. Allvin, and Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman collectively shared the need for immediate modernization in the face of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-intelligence-finding-shows-china-surging-equipment-sales-russia-help-war-effort-ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;China&apos;s growing military action.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/america-must-optimize-forces-avoid-losing-war-china-air-force-secretary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMERICA MUST OPTIMIZE FORCES TO AVOID LOSING A WAR WITH CHINA, AIR FORCE SECRETARY SAYS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In describing the plans and needs for space, Saltzman highlighted the importance of a robust Space Force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Against a near-peer adversary, space superiority is the linchpin.  Without it, we cannot deter conflict.  Without it, we cannot provide vital effects.  Without it, we cannot protect the joint force.  Until we have built the infrastructure to achieve space superiority, the Space Force is a work in progress,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of the Air Force has requested a $217.5 billion budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2025, which is set to begin on Oct. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The simultaneous demands of strategic competition with an aggressive and increasingly capable (China) and persistent, acute threats from around the globe require &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/air-force&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Air Force&lt;/a&gt; to maximize the readiness of today’s forces, while adapting our structures and processes to offer the best opportunity to prevail in an environment of enduring great power competition,&quot; Allvin said, adding, &quot;Time is not on our side.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>The Nebo School District in Utah is responding to &amp;apos;rumors&amp;apos; that students are identifying as animals called &amp;apos;furries&amp;apos; and engaging in &amp;apos;licking&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;biting&amp;apos; behavior.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Utah&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/utah&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Nebo School District&lt;/a&gt; is pushing back on allegations from students about &quot;furries&quot; – people who identify as animals – in their middle school, with some rumors of animal-like &quot;licking&quot; and &quot;biting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 75 parents and students at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mt. Nebo Middle School&lt;/a&gt; protested &quot;furries&quot; Wednesday, chanting during a walkout, &quot;We the people, not the animals,&quot; &quot;Compelled speech is not free speech,&quot; &quot;Stop brainwashing us!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, a petition circulated calling out the &quot;furries.&quot; The petition, &quot;Students for Humans at School, not animals aka furries,&quot; as of Thursday had over 1,800 signatures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The petition asks the district to enforce its dress code policy which prohibits any &quot;elements of a student&apos;s appearance that draw undo attention, distract, disrupt, or otherwise interfere with the learning atmosphere at school or at school activities and events, or that create a health, safety or welfare issue are prohibited.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/utah-school-gives-kids-insects-eat-class-climate-change-assignment-says-will-save-planet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UTAH SCHOOL GIVES KIDS &apos;DISGUSTING&apos; INSECTS TO EAT IN CLASS FOR CLIMATE ASSIGNMENT ON COWS KILLING THE EARTH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Please help us in taking care of our children&apos;s well being and safety while at school,&quot; the petition concludes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district denied that students were wearing full animal costumes, while students at the protests alleged some were wearing full animal face masks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district sent out an email to parents in response to the protest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We expect ALL students to be respectful towards each other while we are here at school. We hope you will treat others how you would like to be treated. Outstanding behavior might demonstrate curiosity, understanding, patience and tolerance,&quot; the district said. &quot;One of our goals is to ensure that you are able to come to school, each day to learn the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/curriculum&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;academic curriculum&lt;/a&gt; and appropriate citizenship. As responsible citizens, we hope you will look out for each other, take care of each other and treat each other with kindness.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/arizona-school-board-member-district-should-reject-hiring-teachers-with-christian-values-not-safe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ARIZONA SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER SAYS DISTRICT SHOULD REJECT HIRING TEACHERS WITH CHRISTIAN VALUES: &apos;NOT...SAFE&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/culture-trends&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt;, the district called the allegations &quot;misinformation that had been circulated online.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We want to assure you that rumors circulating online about student behavior are completely untrue,&quot; the district said. &quot;These are 11 and 12-year-old students, and while sometimes these children may come to school with a headband that has ears, sometimes with giant bows, and sometimes dressed as their favorite athlete, there have been no students attending school wearing masks, animal costumes, or acting like animals.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district added that rumors of &quot;biting, licking, costumes, or animal behavior&quot; were &quot;unfounded and are not occurring in our schools.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We promptly address distractions to learning as well as dress code violations to maintain a positive learning environment for everyone… We encourage open communication. If parents or patrons have concerns, we encourage them to please reach out to the school administration or myself. Our top priority is a safe and supportive environment for both students and parents,&quot; the district said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Haley Cavinder was going to play at TCU this year. But after her sister Hanna announced a return to Miami, Haley decided to also return to south Florida for next season.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One year ago, Haley Cavinder said she and twin sister Hanna would forgo their final seasons of NCAA eligibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months later, Haley announced she was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/haley-cavinder-announces-shocking-return-college-basketball-see-you-next-season&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;transferring to TCU&lt;/a&gt; for the 2024-25 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanna sat out last season and announced Wednesday she would return to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/miami-hurricanes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;University of Miami&lt;/a&gt; to play basketball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day later, Haley announced she too would be returning to Miami instead of playing at TCU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My last season of basketball was one of the most successful &amp;amp; challenging yrs of my life but it helped me grow immensely,&quot;  Hanna &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CavinderHanna/status/1780621650620187030&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;posted on X&lt;/a&gt;, formerly Twitter, with an orange heart. &quot;The past few months I have been itching to get back to the game that I thought I lost the passion for.

They first appeared in a WWE ring in June, two months after saying they were turning their focus to the WWE and announcing at the time it was the end of their basketball careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Biden&apos;s false cannibal story described as a simple ‘misstatement,’ ‘off on the details’ by the media</title>
                    
                    <description>Mainstream media reports minimized Biden’s claim that one of his relatives might have been eaten by cannibals as a mischaracterization rather than a lie.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some media outlets reported on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-takes-heat-strange-cannibal-story-something-bad-script&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden telling an odd cannibal story&lt;/a&gt; twice on Wednesday as a &quot;misstatement&quot; rather than an outright lie, which critics say is different from how Trump is normally treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Biden shared a story about his uncle, 2nd Lt. Ambrose J. Finnegan Jr., whom he called &quot;Bosie.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He flew those single-engine planes as reconnaissance over war zones, and he got shot down in New Guinea. They never found the body because there used to be, there were a lot of cannibals, for real, in that part of New Guinea,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden also told a version of the story earlier that day while visiting the missing-in-action war memorial in his hometown of Scranton claiming, &quot;He got shot down in an area where there were a lot of cannibals in New Guinea at the time. They never recovered [Finnegan&apos;s] body. But the government went back, when I went down there, and they checked and found some parts of the plane and the like.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bidens-fictional-tales-fact-checked-wapo-ny-times-outlets-stop-short-declaring-them-lies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN&apos;S FICTIONAL TALES FACT-CHECKED BY WAPO, NY TIMES BUT OUTLETS STOP SHORT OF DECLARING THEM &apos;LIES&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though military &lt;a href=&quot;https://dpaa-mil.sites.crmforce.mil/dpaaProfile?id=a0Jt000001nzWi4EAE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;records&lt;/a&gt; from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency showed that Biden’s uncle died after a plane crash in the Pacific Ocean with no reference to possible cannibalism, several outlets stopped short of calling it a lie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News Digital, when it comes to &quot;the likes of Donald Trump, the knee-jerk instinct is to use the word &apos;lie.&apos;&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-mischaracterizes-uncles-disappearance-world-war-ii-rcna148318?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma&amp;amp;taid=6620a555d453a400011f8e78&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;A headline for NBC&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday read, &quot;Biden mischaracterizes his uncle&apos;s disappearance during World War II,&quot; and noted that Biden &quot;was drawing a contrast between the military service of his family and Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric about military members.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though NBC acknowledged that U.S. military records did not reference cannibalism regarding Biden’s uncle’s death, the article only referred to the comments as an &quot;apparent misstatement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Biden and his fellow leftists are always given the benefit of the doubt. With the liberal media and the so-called fact-checkers out there, a certain degree of innocence is assigned to Democrats when they say things that are untrue,&quot; said Houck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other outlets continued the distancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/biden-uncle-world-war-ii-cannibals-trump-4f3b7d1c988e041fbc07f60f952ca95f?utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; featured a headline the same day reading, &quot;Biden is off on details of his uncle’s WWII death as he calls Trump unfit to lead the military.&quot; In the article itself, AP wrote that Biden only &quot;misstated key details&quot; about his uncle’s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/biden-uncle-cannibal-ambrose-finnegan-rcna148363&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;MSNBC’s online coverage&lt;/a&gt; of Biden’s comment on Thursday called the cannibalism suggestion &quot;odd&quot; and noted that Biden had never brought up the story before Wednesday. However, the piece described Biden’s claims as simply an &quot;embellishment&quot; or &quot;unsubstantiated family lore,&quot; despite also acknowledging the military records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/17/politics/biden-uncle-cannibals-new-guinea/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;CNN reported&lt;/a&gt; simply, &quot;Biden’s accounting of his uncle’s death — and possible cannibalization — differs from the account published by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting agency.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Houck told Fox News Digital, &quot;The profession in which accuracy, facts, and truth are supposedly paramount, they turn into armchair psychologists whenever one of their own lies and all but insist so and so didn&apos;t really mean it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course, Trump -- like any politician -- plays fast and loose with the facts, but the reality is there isn&apos;t just less scrutiny for the other side. In many cases, there&apos;s no scrutiny at all,&quot; he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bidens-issues-truth-constantly-dismissed-downplayed-softened-media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN’S LIES, OUTRIGHT FABRICATIONS REPEATEDLY DISMISSED, DOWNPLAYED AND SOFTENED BY MEDIA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about Biden’s claim during a gaggle on Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre avoided directly referencing the cannibal story and instead focused on the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You saw the president, he was incredibly proud of his uncle’s service in uniform. You saw him at the War Memorial. It was incredibly emotional and important to him,&quot; Jean-Pierre answered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued, &quot;You saw him respond to all of you when asked about the moment yesterday and his uncle who lost his life when the military aircraft he was on crashed in the Pacific after taking off near New Guinea. The president highlighted his uncle’s story as he made the case for honoring our sacred commitment to equip those we send to war and to take care of them and their families when they come home, and, as he reiterated, that the last thing American veterans are suckers or losers, and he wanted to make that clear.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When questioned further, she insisted that she didn’t &quot;have anything beyond what [she] just laid out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But it was a really proud moment for him. It was incredibly emotional. I think some of your colleagues … were there, and they got to witness the president pray at the war memorial, look for his uncle’s name, honor him, and I think we can’t forget that moment. We cannot also forget what it means to be a commander in chief, what it means to lift up our service members, what it means to make sure that we respect their service, and he made that contract very clear as to what we saw from the former president,&quot; Jean-Pierre said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/missouri&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey&lt;/a&gt; is calling out Kansas City mayor Quinton Lucas after he announced that illegal immigrants would be welcome to come to the city and work under Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas’ illegal immigrant parole program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey highlighted how the open border policies have real-world consequences in a letter to Mayor Lucas that was shared exclusively with Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;An illegal alien from Venezula, who had repeatedly flouted U.S. immigration laws, was actually granted a work permit under a misguided and illegal policy enacted by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas,&quot; Bailey stated. &quot;In February, he brutally murdered a young college student named Laken Hope Riley.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey shared that Lucas failed to acknowledge this and openly welcomed all seeking refuge in Kansas City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mayorkas-grilled-by-lawmakers-on-release-of-laken-rileys-alleged-killer-into-us-your-policies-in-action&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LAWMAKERS BERATE MAYORKAS ON LAKEN RILEY MURDER: ‘YOUR POLICIES IN ACTION’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yet, against the backdrop &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;of literally millions of illegal aliens&lt;/a&gt; flooding our borders, overwhelming the social safety net of large American cities, and in some cases even committing violent crimes against our citizens, you are actively encouraging them to come to the Show Me State,&quot; Bailey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey referenced the post Lucas wrote on social media proclaiming:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All are welcome in Kansas City. Proud to work with my fellow mayors from Denver and NYC as we work to ensure decompression of new arriving communities.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey added that Lucas did later amend his statement and only extended the offer to &quot;persons who are lawfully present, with lawful work permits,&quot; but said that Lucas ignored the underlying issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Secretary Mayorkas&apos; open border programs are themselves illegal. Your statements are wildly irresponsible,&quot; Bailey said. &quot;Not only do you ignore the fact that Laken Riley&apos;s killer has a so-called &quot;work permit,&quot; but you are actively encouraging Missouri businesses to become entangled in a fundamentally unlawful program, and exposing them to legal liability in the process.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-senator-open-border-migrant-killed-staffer-illegally-entered-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEM SENATOR&apos;S CLAIM DOWNPLAYING BORDER CRISIS RESURFACES AFTER STAFFER KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey said that allowing and welcoming illegal immigrants violates a Missouri law that prohibits state businesses from hiring or employing illegal immigrants. It also makes it a felony to knowingly transport illegal immigrants in the state of Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Make no mistake, my office will do everything in its power to take legal action against any person or entity found to be in violation of these statutes,&quot; Bailey proclaimed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey continued stating that Missouri will now join 19 other state attorney generals who are suing Secretary Mayorkas over his &quot;disastrous&quot; and illegal parole program that unlawfully creates a pathway to citizenship for hundreds or thousands of illegal immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his letter, Bailey stated that Mayorkas&apos; illegal immigrant parole program &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;would allow up to 360,000&lt;/a&gt; illegal immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to be &quot;paroled&quot; into the United States every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Your open invitation for illegal aliens to come to Missouri is not only dangerous but comes at great expense to Missouri taxpayers, residents, and business owners,&quot; Bailey said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/denver-mayor-boasts-shared-sacrifice-required-make-city-welcoming-migrants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DENVER MAYOR BOASTS &apos;SHARED SACRIFICE&apos; IS REQUIRED TO MAKE CITY &apos;WELCOMING&apos; FOR MIGRANTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey&apos;s letter to Lucas comes a day after Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., gave fiery testimony to the Senate for striking down Mayorkas&apos; impeachment trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Hawley joined other Republican lawmakers who tore into Secretary Mayorkas on Thursday over the release of the Venezuelan illegal immigrant now charged with the murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley – accusing the agency of having released him into the U.S. unlawfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers grilled the embattled secretary on Jose Ibarra, an illegal immigrant from Venezuela, who is accused of killing Riley on Feb. 22, while she was jogging at the University of Georgia in Athens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his testimony, Sen. Hawley revealed that Ibarra had been given a work permit, despite having been accused of a crime against a child in New York and having the charges later expunged by local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nothing is done to this guy. He had a criminal record to start with, he&apos;s in the country on illegal grounds. You have falsely and illegally allowed him in. He committed a crime against a child. He&apos;s not prosecuted, it&apos;s expunged. In November, get this, in November, Ibarra files an application for employment authorization. And unbelievably, on December 9, 2023, it&apos;s approved,&quot; Hawley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration initially announced the parole program for Venezuelans in October, which allowed a limited number to fly directly into the U.S. as long as they had not entered illegally and already had a sponsor in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in January, President Biden announced that the program would be expanded to include Haitians, Nicaraguans and Cubans and that the program would allow up to 30,000 a month into the U.S. The program also allows for migrants to receive work permits and a two-year authorization to live in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to Mayor Quinton Lucas for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; and Caroline Elliott contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Missouri lawmakers vote to expand tax credit-backed private school scholarships</title>
                    
                    <description>Missouri legislators voted Thursday in favor of a bill to expand private school scholarships. If enacted, it would allow up to $6,375 in spending per child.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/missouri&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Missouri lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday passed a bill to expand private school scholarships statewide, an effort made possible by extensive compromises including a commitment to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more on public schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GOP-led House voted with a bare-minimum margin of 82-69 to send the measure to Republican Gov. Mike Parson. If signed, it would offer up to $6,375 per child for expenses including tuition, textbooks, tutoring, transportation, extracurriculars and summer school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill’s passage is a victory for advocates who have struggled for years to expand access to charter schools, virtual schools and private schools in Missouri. Worries about taking away resources from traditional kindergarten-12th grade public schools have been bipartisan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/draft-report-says-missouris-house-speaker-stymied-ethics-investigation-spending&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DRAFT REPORT SAYS MISSOURI&apos;S HOUSE SPEAKER STYMIED ETHICS INVESTIGATION INTO HIS SPENDING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heart of the legislation is the expansion of Missouri Empowerment Scholarships Accounts, which low-income families can draw from. The money will come from private donors, who in return get tax credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a victory for parents who want more control over their children’s education and for students who will now have more avenues to achieve their full potential,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/republicans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Republican Rep. Phil Christofanelli&lt;/a&gt; said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current scholarship program limits recipients to residents of the state’s largest cities and to families who make less than 200% of the federal poverty level, which works out to $62,400 a year for a family of four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill passed Thursday would raise the cap to 300%, or $93,600 for a family of four. Public school students who need extra help through individualized education plans would get some additional scholarship money under the new law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation increases the cap on tax credits for the private donations from $50 million to $75 million per year, to help pay for a possible influx of students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gain support from lawmakers focused on helping traditional public schools, senators included money to raise minimum teacher salaries to $40,000 a year and adjusted the state&apos;s formula for funding public schools, a change expected to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars more to public education over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/democrats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;House Democrats&lt;/a&gt; cautioned that the state might not have enough revenue in future years to provide the massive influx in funding to public schools that the bill commits to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While the voucher expansion is essentially guaranteed, the promises to public schools depend on additional funding the state isn’t expected to have and future lawmakers aren’t required to provide,&quot; House Democratic Minority Leader Crystal Quade said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another provision would allow charter schools in Boone County, where Senate President Pro Tem Caleb Rowden lives. The bill also would require public votes to approve a school district’s switch to four-day school weeks and incentivize schools that maintain five-day weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This issue supporters call &quot;school choice&quot; has divided lawmakers beyond typical Republican-Democrat lines in Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOP legislators from rural districts have opposed allowing charter schools in their areas for years, fearing they could draw students away from traditional public schools seen as the backbone of their communities. Some Democrats, meanwhile, want students in underperforming urban schools to have more options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And some conservatives lobbied against more regulations for homeschoolers and private schools. One activist handed out &quot;dog poop&quot; brownies before the vote, suggesting that unwanted provisions could ruin what might otherwise be a nice treat.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa granted clemency Thursday to over 4,000 prisoners, including some who had been on death row.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa granted clemency to more than 4,000 prisoners, including some who were on death row, in an independence day amnesty on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zimbabwe marked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology/history&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;44 years of independence&lt;/a&gt; from white minority rule, which ended in 1980 after a bloody bush war. The country’s name was changed from Rhodesia to Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidential amnesty, the second in less than a year, benefits female, older and juvenile inmates, the terminally ill and some who were originally sentenced to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/kenyas-military-chief-dies-helicopter-crash&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KENYA’S MILITARY CHIEF DIES IN A HELICOPTER CRASH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those once on death row but who had their sentences commuted to life terms in previous clemency orders or through court appeals are to be freed provided they have been in prison for at least 20 years, according to the clemency order, which was announced Wednesday and due to take effect on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All female prisoners who had served at least a third of their sentence by independence day are being freed, as are juvenile inmates who have served the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prisoners age 60 and older who have served one tenth of their sentences will also be released. Mnangagwa also pardoned the blind and others with disabilities who have served a third of their sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prisoners are being released in batches across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, those jailed for &quot;specified&quot; offences that include sexual offences, robbery, public violence, unlawful possession of firearms, human trafficking and theft or vandalism of electricity and telecommunications infrastructure won&apos;t benefit from the amnesty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All death row prisoners who have been in jail for at least 10 years had their sentences commuted to life in prison under the amnesty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zimbabwe has more than 60 inmates on death row. It wasn&apos;t immediately clear how many of those had their sentences commuted to life under the amnesty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zimbabwe is one of more than a dozen countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/africa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Africa&lt;/a&gt; and more than 50 across the world that have the death penalty, although the country&apos;s last hanging was in 2005. Mnangagwa says he supports abolishing the death penalty, a move which was backed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-politics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Cabinet&lt;/a&gt; in February and is now awaiting approval from Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mnangagwa freed more than 4,000 prisoners in another clemency order last May aimed at decongesting the southern African nation&apos;s overcrowded prisons, where conditions are usually harsh. At the time, Zimbabwe had about 22,000 prisoners crammed into prisons with a capacity of 17,000.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The NHL announced the agreement on Thursday, making Wednesday&apos;s game the Coyotes&apos; final game in Arizona. Arizona won, 5-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is the last one in Arizona for a little bit, and we wanted to have a good effort, show that to the fans,&quot; Coyotes forward Clayton Keller said after the game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There were a lot of emotions, and there was a lot of sadness,&quot; Coyotes coach André Tourigny added. &quot;We&apos;ve gone through a bit of adversity, and I&apos;m really proud the way the players responded.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relocation rumors buzzed for years, but a move to Mullett Arena, a 5,000-seat venue&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/arizona-state-sun-devils&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 seemed like the final nail in the coffin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But hockey in Arizona might still have a future. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nhl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The NHL&apos;s announcement&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday gives Meruelo the rights to the Coyotes if he can build &quot;a new, state-of-the-art facility appropriate for an NHL team&quot; within a five-year period. In the meantime, Smith gets an expansion team in Salt Lake City and will take control of the Coyotes&apos; assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Paulina Dedaj and The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Mike Johnson: The wartime Speaker battling on multiple fronts</title>
                    
                    <description>Republicans again are considering ousting the Speaker of the House of Representatives; will the House GOP successfully remove Mike Johnson from his title?</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&quot;I regard myself as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a wartime Speaker&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; declared House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only, we’re not sure if Johnson was referring to the internecine war among Republicans over whether he should keep his job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many members wear pocket squares with their suits. But not Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. He walks around with a self-made, diode &quot;debt clock&quot; tucked into the breast pocket of his jacket, tracking the skyrocketing debt. Massie’s ascending fiscal chronometer may have read more $34 trillion dollars this week. But the only number which mattered on Capitol Hill Tuesday morning was &quot;two.&quot; As in two House members who were ready to oust Johnson from his job: Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The motion (to remove Johnson) will get called. And then he’s going to lose more votes than (former House Speaker) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kevin-mccarthy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kevin McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;, R-Calif., And I told him this in private, like two weeks ago,&quot; said Massie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-rebels-derail-johnsons-border-security-pitch-fury-95b-foreign-aid-plan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOP REBELS DERAIL SPEAKER JOHNSON’S BORDER BILL AMID FURY OVER FOREIGN AID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reporter asked Massie about what that meant, not having a leader – again – for the second time in less than a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some would say we’d be rudderless. But we have a rudder. We’re steering everything toward (Senate Majority Leader) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/chuck-schumer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chuck Schumer&lt;/a&gt;, D-N.Y.,&quot; replied Massie. &quot;There has not been a change. I mean, if the country likes Chuck Schumer, then they should like what Speaker Johnson’s accomplished in the House.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s strength in numbers – even if the numbers are low. After all, it’s about the math. It matters even more in a House which is currently split at 218 Republicans to 213 Democrats. That meager Republican majority shrivels to 217-213 after Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisc., quits. Gallagher was supposed to leave Friday. But Fox is told that the Wisconsin Republican will at least hang around until Saturday as the House tries to approve the international aid supplemental package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greene beamed at the support from Massie for her effort to remove Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was significant,&quot; said Greene of Massie’s backing. &quot;It also lets people know this is a lot more serious than people realized.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greene echoed Massie, suggesting &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;there’ll be more&lt;/a&gt;&quot; Republicans who might vote to remove Johnson &quot;than were against Kevin McCarthy.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the problem for Greene. She doesn’t have someone who could win a Speaker’s vote on the floor. That’s why the House burned 22 days on the calendar last October and thrashed through three nominees for Speaker before finally settling on Johnson. If the House approved a &quot;motion to vacate the chair&quot; (a &quot;MTV,&quot; which removes the Speaker), there’s no telling how long it would take the get a successor this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don’t think that the threat is really real at this point, just because you don’t have an alternative,&quot; said Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., who was a top lieutenant to McCarthy. &quot;We saw what happened last fall when this all went down. There’s not an alternative.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-tees-up-17-bills-related-to-iran-israel-for-week&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOUSE TEES UP 17 BILLS RELATED TO IRAN/ISRAEL FOR THIS WEEK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graves said a number of conservatives who were mad at Johnson &quot;don’t think past step one. Which is why we have so many problems here right now.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graves asserted that the &quot;painful scars&quot; of the McCarthy debacle would be &quot;a major disincentive for folks who actually pull the trigger on a motion to vacate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was significant blowback from conservatives after Johnson announced a four-pronged approach to grapple with the Middle East. Especially after the House plotted a course for the week &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;of 17 bills&lt;/a&gt; dealing either with Israel or Iran. Johnson tailored his pitch on the foreign aid measure. He planned one bill for Israel. One for Ukraine. One for Taiwan. The final bill would include a plan to repossess Russian assets and grant some of the assistance to Ukraine as a &quot;lease.&quot; That’s an option endorsed by former President Trump. But the sweetener to the fourth bill would be a measure to curb the use of TikTok in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The House would then package the four bills together and send them to the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s got a chance of passing,&quot; said Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, Tuesday morning. But if you &quot;MIRV&quot; them together and pretend that they were really separate votes, but at the end of the day, it has the effect of being one vote. I mean, that&apos;s all smoke and mirrors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davidson characterized the TikTok provisions as &quot;camouflage for defending America.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;‘MIRV’ them together?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;MIRV&quot; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Capitol vocabulary term&lt;/a&gt; you’re going to hear about as the House tries to advance the four separate foreign aid bills - and then blend them into one for efficiency purposes before sending the package to the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6351121595112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SENATE VOTE ON MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT REACHES &apos;UNPRECEDENTED TERRITORY&apos;: CHAD PERGRAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s pronounced &quot;merve.&quot; A &quot;MIRV&quot; is a vestige of the Cold War and missile counts between the United States and Soviet Union. It stands for &quot;Multiple Independently-Targetable Re-Entry Vehicle.&quot; Each MIRV had multiple nuclear warheads or &quot;MIRVs&quot; attached. This was an issue of contention between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. Was a MIRV counted as one missile or four or five? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that the House would vote on each individual bill - then blend them together as one for the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A parliamentary MIRV!  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence why conservatives are upset about the plan by Johnson. It’s four bills. Or is it one? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson defended the MIRV maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m concerned that Israel might not pass through the Senate right now if it’s not included in the package,&quot; said Johnson. &quot;If you separate them, then none of our priorities will be reflected, I’m afraid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservatives have also implored Johnson to attach border security to the plan. But that might not be feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We don’t have the votes. If you put Ukraine in any package, you can’t also do the border because I lose Republican votes on that rule. My friends don’t get it,&quot; replied Johnson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are they still your friends?&quot; asked yours truly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mike-johnson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;all my friends&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; said Johnson. &quot;I love everybody in this building.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson made his decision on Monday against taking the streamlined Senate aid bill approved in February and instead traveled his own route. Initial information about the plan was scant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What are they doing over there?&quot; asked Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., of your reporter on Monday night as we both exited the Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;what&quot; was the House’s approach on an international aid package. But &quot;over there&quot; referred to the U.S. House of Representatives, that hostile, untamed, political wilderness which lies beyond the boundaries of the Capitol Rotunda.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate isn’t exactly a peaceful place. But considering the contretemps in the House, the Senate is practically Xanadu. Especially as Republicans skirmish with one another over foreign aid, leadership and a wartime Speaker.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Tensions erupt on House floor as conservatives confront Johnson on $95B foreign aid plan</title>
                    
                    <description>Tensions over the House foreign aid proposal erupted on Thursday when a group of House Republicans got into a confrontation over conservatives&amp;apos; pressure on Speaker Mike Johnson.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tensions flared in the House of Representatives on Thursday when a group of conservatives confronted Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., over his foreign aid plan, leading to another Republican trading barbs with the group of rebels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of lawmakers that included Reps. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.; Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.; Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.; and others could be seen huddled with Johnson on the House floor after morning votes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discussion appeared to be interrupted a short while later when Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., confronted the group, and wound up in a particularly heated back-and-forth with Gaetz. Van Orden later told Fox News Digital that he called Gaetz &quot;tubby&quot; and dared the GOP rebels to trigger a vote for Johnson’s ouster — a threat he’s facing from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/motion-to-vacate-filed-against-speaker-johnson-lawmakers-say&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.&lt;/a&gt;, and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who were not in the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaetz later told reporters that the conversation with Johnson was &quot;tense&quot; and that they were expressing opposition to his $95 billion proposal of separate bills for aid to Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/definition-of-insanity-frustrated-house-republicans-blast-gop-rebels-threat-oust-johnson&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&apos;DEFINITION OF INSANITY&apos;: FRUSTRATED HOUSE REPUBLICANS BLAST GOP REBELS&apos; THREAT TO OUST JOHNSON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes as Johnson faces blowback from members on the right of his conference over the plan, which is roughly the same cost as the Senate’s combined Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-expected-pass-controversial-foreign-aid-bill-billions-ukraine-israel-taiwan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;funding package&lt;/a&gt; passed earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We don’t want to pass his bill. The only win we’ve got in the House of Representatives is blocking the Senate supplemental. If we’re going to throw in the towel on that, what are we doing here?&quot; Gaetz asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key difference in Johnson’s plan is having House members vote on each of the bills separately before sending them in a combined package to the Senate — in order to give lawmakers the opportunity to take a stand on each issue and separating the politically fraught matter of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But conservatives balked at the lack of U.S. border security provisions tied to the Ukraine bill. Indeed, a GOP lawmaker familiar with the confrontation on the House floor told Fox News Digital that they were pushing Johnson to consider options that include border policy rather than going forward with his planned Saturday foreign aid vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I thought we were making some real headway, and then had a member walk up and just start name-calling and just getting in people’s faces,&quot; the GOP lawmaker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/johnson-likely-forced-get-dem-help-foreign-aid-plan-republicans-decry-lack-border-measures&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOHNSON LIKELY FORCED TO GET DEM HELP ON FOREIGN AID PLAN AS REPUBLICANS DECRY LACK OF BORDER MEASURES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were almost certainly referring to Van Orden, who later told Fox News Digital that he joined the fray because he noticed the speaker needed &quot;a swim buddy,&quot; a term for a teammate that Van Orden borrowed from his days in the Navy SEALs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gaetz was speaking to the speaker in a matter that I just, I did not think it was appropriate,&quot; Van Orden said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They start calling me stupid — incredibly juvenile things. And so I said something along the lines of, ‘Kick rocks, tubby,’ to Matt … And the reason I did that is because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/g/matt-gaetz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Matt Gaetz&lt;/a&gt; is a bully. He just got up in my face, and I&apos;m not gonna be intimidated by that guy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Orden is one of the many rank-and-file Republicans who have accused House Freedom Caucus members and their allies of hurting the conference with hardball tactics against their fellow GOP lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Orden said he dared them to make good on threats to call a motion to vacate, a procedural maneuver that would trigger a vote on ousting the speaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/massie-threatens-oust-speaker-johnson-if-he-doesnt-step-down-over-foreign-aid-plan&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MASSIE THREATENS TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON IF HE DOESN’T STEP DOWN OVER FOREIGN AID PLAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about his confrontation with Van Orden later, Gaetz called it &quot;very puzzling and concerning.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The only thing I gleaned from it is that Mr. Van Orden is not a particularly intelligent individual,&quot; Gaetz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that his confidence in Johnson was &quot;diminishing&quot; over his actions on foreign aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, a vote on those bills is expected Saturday evening. Another border security bill that Johnson put forward to ease GOP concerns was blown up on Thursday night before it could get to the House floor by conservatives who accused Johnson of putting it up as a messaging bill with no real momentum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Trump hush money trial: Meet the jurors who will hear Bragg&apos;s case against the 2024 presidential candidate</title>
                    
                    <description>Jurors have been selected and sworn in so far to serve on the jury for former President Donald Trump’s historic criminal trial.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Twelve jurors have been selected and sworn in to serve on the jury for former&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-criminal-trial-is-having-a-reverse-effect-campaigns-new-york-bodega-vows-save-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; President Donald Trump’s&lt;/a&gt; historic and unprecedented first criminal trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-criminal-trial-is-having-a-reverse-effect-campaigns-new-york-bodega-vows-save-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trump,&lt;/a&gt; the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has been charged by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The charges are related to alleged hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-criminal-trial-is-having-a-reverse-effect-campaigns-new-york-bodega-vows-save-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP SAYS CRIMINAL TRIAL IS HAVING A &apos;REVERSE EFFECT,&apos; AS HE CAMPAIGNS AT NEW YORK BODEGA, VOWS TO SAVE CITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has pleaded not guilty to all counts. He has blasted the trial as pure politics, a &quot;political persecution&quot; and maintains his innocence. The former president is expected to testify during his trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of jury selection on Thursday, the third day of jury selection, 12 jurors had been selected and sworn in. The jury pool so far includes four men and three women, all living in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. Their professions included work in law, finance, technology and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bragg-files-motion-hold-trump-contempt-alleged-gag-order-violations-threatens-30-days-jail-time&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BRAGG FILES MOTION TO HOLD TRUMP IN CONTEMPT FOR ALLEGED GAG ORDER VIOLATIONS, THREATENS 30 DAYS OF JAIL TIME&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have our jury,&quot; Judge Juan Merchan said when the 12th juror was picked Thursday afternoon. &quot;Let&apos;s pick our alternates.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merchan dismissed the remaining prospective jurors and asked that they return to court Friday so that alternate jurors could be selected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a look at each of the jurors so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juror #1 lives in New York City. He has no children and enjoys doing anything outdoorsy. He gets his news from The New York Times, Daily Mail, Fox News and MSNBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked by Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche if he was aware Trump is charged in other cases and jurisdictions, and how that affects him, the man said, &quot;I don’t have an opinion.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juror #2 is a man who said he follows Trump&apos;s former lawyer Michael Cohen on &quot;X,&quot; formerly known as Twitter, as well as other &quot;right wing&quot; accounts, including former Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason, he said, he follows those figures was so he could be plugged in to &quot;anything that might move the markets I might need to know about.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if he would unfollow Cohen, as he may be a witness in the trial, the man said: &quot;Absolutely.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man also said he has &quot;not seen any evidence&quot; relating to the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I will try to keep an open mind,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responding to questions from Trump lawyer Susan Necheles about his feelings about the former president, the man said that Trump has done some good for the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s ambivalent,&quot; he said. &quot;It goes both ways.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first person who was labeled juror #2 was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trial-juror-excused-saying-does-not-think-she-can-be-fair&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;excused Thursday morning&lt;/a&gt; after saying she could not be a fair juror. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juror #3 is a young to middle-aged man who lives in Manhattan. The man said he grew up in Oregon and has been an attorney for five years practicing corporate law. The man said he enjoys hiking and running, and gets his news from The New York Times and Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juror #4 is originally from California, but has lived in New York City for 15 years. The man said he has been a security engineer for 25 years and holds a high school diploma, with some college education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man is married with three children. His wife is a teacher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his spare time, he enjoys being with his children, woodworking and metal working. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man said he has served on a jury before — on both a grand jury and a jury in a criminal trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man said he gets his news from &quot;a smattering&quot; of news sources. As for social media, he said he doesn&apos;t use it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man said he has a relative who works in finance and brothers-in-law that work as lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man said he has no feelings about how Trump is being treated in this case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trial-juror-excused-saying-does-not-think-she-can-be-fair&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP HUSH MONEY TRIAL: JUROR EXCUSED AFTER SAYING SHE DOES NOT THINK SHE CAN BE FAIR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person who was first labeled as Juror #4 was excused Thursday morning after it was revealed that he had been previously arrested in Westchester, New York, for tearing down right-wing political advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juror #5 is a young and a New York native who has been a teacher of English Language Arts for eight years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman was previously a caseworker at a juvenile detention center. She said she has a masters&apos; degree in education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m creative at heart,&quot; she said, adding that she enjoys photography. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman said that she is not married and does not have children. Her mother was an administrative aide for a police department, and her godfather was a homicide detective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman said she gets her news from Google and TikTok. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was asked if Trump chose not to testify, whether she would hold that against him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I won’t hold that against him,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She explained that she has friends who have strong opinions on the former president but said she is not a political person and tries to avoid political conversations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She did say, however, that she appreciates Trump’s candor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;President Trump speaks his mind, and I’d rather that than someone who’s in office who you don’t know what they’re thinking,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When jurors were asked if they were aware Trump was charged in other cases than Bragg’s, most jurors were. However, juror #5 raised her hand to indicate that she was learning of additional charges for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juror #6 is a young woman who lives in Manhattan. She described herself as a New Yorker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman is a software engineer and said she likes to dance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juror #7 is originally from North Carolina and works as an attorney and civil litigator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man said he is married with two children, and his wife works in risk management for a bank. He said he enjoys spending time outdoors and with his family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man said he gets his news from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and The Washington Post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if his career as a lawyer would impact his ability to serve fair and impartially, or whether his opinions would get in his way, the man said that he does have &quot;political views as to the Trump presidency&quot; and said there were likely Trump administration policies he disagreed with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don’t know the man and I don’t have any opinions about him personally,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for his career as a lawyer, he said he does not have any opinions about Trump’s character. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I certainly follow the news,&quot; he said. &quot;I’m aware there are other lawsuits out there. But I’m not sure that I know anyone’s character.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juror #8 has been selected. Information on this juror is not yet available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juror #9 is a woman who lives in Manhattan. She is originally from New Jersey and works as a speech therapist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman is not married and does not have children. She said she likes to spend time with friends, go to restaurants and go on walks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman said she has never served on a jury before, and does not watch the news or follow current events too closely. The woman said she did, though, have email subscriptions to CNN and The New York Times. She said she follows social media accounts, listens to podcasts and enjoys reality television. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman said she does not listen to talk radio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman said she can be fair and impartial. She said she does have opinions about Trump, but said she believes she can put them aside and be fair and impartial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juror #10 is a man who lives in Manhattan. He was born and raised in Ohio and works in commerce for a large company. The man has a college degree. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man said he is not married and has no children, but lives with another adult who works in accounting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man said he enjoys being outdoors and loves animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man said he does not really follow the news, but listens to podcasts on behavioral psychology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man said he has no strong opinions on how Trump is being treated in this case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juror #11 has been selected. Information on this juror was not immediately available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juror #12 has been selected. Information on this juror was not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Grace Taggart contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of killing four University of Idaho students, said he was out driving to take a hike and see &amp;quot;the moon and stars&amp;quot; at the time of the murders, his lawyers said.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bryan Kohberger, the man &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/true-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;accused of killing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; four University of Idaho undergrads in a home invasion stabbing, offered up an alibi via his attorneys on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kohberger, 29, claims he was out driving the night of the killings on Nov. 13, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Kohberger was out driving in the early morning hours of November 13, 2022; as he often did to hike and run and/or see the moon and stars,&quot; his lawyers said in court documents filed that outline his alibi. &quot;He drove throughout the area south of Pullman, Washington, west of Moscow, Idaho including Wawawai Park.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kohberger — a former criminology Ph.D. student at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/college&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Washington State University&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in nearby Pullman, Washington — is charged with four counts of murder and burglary after he allegedly stabbed 20-year-old Xana Kernodle, 20-year-old Ethan Chapin, 21-year-old Kaylee Goncalves and 21-year-old Madison Mogen with a KA-BAR knife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/bryan-kohberger-lawyer-alleges-public-bias-residents-called-police-after-being-contacted-juror-survey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KOHBERGER LAWYER ALLEGES PUBLIC BIAS AS RESIDENTS CALLED POLICE AFTER BEING CONTACTED IN JUROR SURVEY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was arrested in late December 2022. Kohberger offered up the alibi, but it is not clear if he has evidence to back it up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He claims to like all these outdoor activities. So does he have pics on social media or his phone or just someplace showing this?&quot; David Gelman, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;criminal defense attorney&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a former deputy district attorney, told Fox News Digital. &quot;In his apartment, did the police find outdoor gear? This will all disprove the alibi he offers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kohberger frequently drove at night during the school year, which is supported by his phone showing him in the countryside in the late night hours on multiple instances, court documents said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/idaho-judge-gives-bryan-kohberger-win-over-genetic-genealogy-battle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IDAHO JUDGE GIVES BRYAN KOHBERGER WIN OVER GENETIC GENEALOGY BATTLE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is supported by data from Mr. Kohberger’s phone showing him in the countryside late at night and/or in the early morning on several occasions,&quot; the documents state. &quot;The phone data includes numerous photographs taken on several different late evenings and early mornings, including in November, depicting the night sky.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defense lawyers plan to offer an expert to prove that Kohberger&apos;s cell phone was south of Pullman, Washington and west of Moscow, Idaho on the night of the killings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Gelman noted that Kohberger&apos;s DNA was found at the crime scene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The defense is doing a great job of muddying the waters because they are trying to show reasonable doubt which is all a juror needs to vote not guilty, but DNA doesn’t lie,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement obtained by NewsNation&apos;s Brian Entin, Kaylee Goncalves&apos;s family reacted to Kohberger&apos;s alibi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have been waiting on this information for months and it has finally arrived,&quot; the statement read. &quot;Now that it is here we feel even more confident in the prosecution of the Defendant. The Defense&apos;s claim is that the Defendant was driving late at night hiking/running around stargazing. We are not sure why it has taken over a year for this to come out as those don&apos;t seem to be complicated activities. We believe that if this alibi had any weight it would have been submitted months ago.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family went on to say Kohberger&apos;s claims are &quot;not really an alibi&quot; because of conflicting data about when Kohberger&apos;s cell phone was turned on and his location. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family said they &quot;look forward to justice in the case&quot; and thanked people for showing them support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A date for Kohberger&apos;s trial has not yet been set. Prosecutors are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;seeking the death penalty&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>The Ohio Attorney General shot down a plan to allow President Biden to appear on state ballots despite being scheduled to miss a key deadline.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost&apos;s office rejected an effort by state Democrats to circumvent a key election deadline to allow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt; on state ballots this week, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documents show correspondence from Yost&apos;s office and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-missing-ohios-general-election-ballot-due-key-deadline-issue-election-official-warns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ohio Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; Frank LaRose, as well as attorney Donald McTigue, who is representing Democrats on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LaRose, a Republican, had notified state Democrats earlier this month that the Democratic National Convention would not occur until more than a week after Ohio&apos;s Aug. 7 deadline for certifying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;presidential candidates&lt;/a&gt;. LaRose warned that either the Ohio assembly would have to vote to change the law, or Democrats would have to move up their plans for certifying Biden and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Vice President Harris&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McTigue responded in an April 9 letter, arguing the secretary of state had the authority to accept a provisional certification of Biden and Harris&apos; nominations prior to the official certification at the party&apos;s convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-ripped-admitting-quiet-part-out-loud-panic-key-strategy-helping-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DEMS BLASTED OVER LEAKED MEMO THAT SAYS &apos;QUIET PART OUT LOUD&apos; ABOUT VOTER REGISTRATION EFFORTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He claimed Ohio law allows for a provisional move because Biden and Harris &quot;have secured the pledged delegates necessary to become the party&apos;s nominees.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/democratic-strategist-boasts-party-fought-undermine-dangerous-third-party-threat-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST BOASTS PARTY FOUGHT TO UNDERMINE &apos;DANGEROUS&apos; THIRD-PARTY THREAT TO BIDEN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LaRose then consulted with Yost&apos;s office about the proposed solution, but the attorney general shot down the plan in a statement on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Democratic Party’s notion of providing a ‘provisional certification’ by the statutory deadline simply is not provided for by law,&quot; Yost&apos;s office said. &quot;Instead, the law mandates the Democratic Party to actually certify its president and vice-president candidates on or before August 7, 2024. No alternative process is permitted.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thus, the Secretary of State lacks authority to accept ‘provisional certifications’ from the Democratic Party pursuant to [the law]. The Democratic Party must actually certify its presidential candidates on or before August 7, 2024 to be placed on the 2024 General Election ballot,&quot; the statement continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McTigue has yet to offer a response to the attorney general&apos;s office, and he did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Biden&apos;s campaign continues to insist that he will be on the ballot in &quot;all 50 states.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the full response to McTigue from Yost&apos;s office below:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read McTigue&apos;s proposal for a &quot;provisional certification&quot; below:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
