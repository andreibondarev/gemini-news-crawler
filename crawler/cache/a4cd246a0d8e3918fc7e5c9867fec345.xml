                    <title>Russia has detained suspects in Caucasus linked to Moscow terror attack, security agency says</title>
                    
                    <description>Russia&amp;apos;s Federal Security Service says that it has broken up a terrorist cell whose members &amp;quot;directly participated in financing the perpetrators&amp;quot; of the Moscow terror attack.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Russia&apos;s top security agency said Monday it has broken up what it called a &quot;terrorist cell&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in southern Russia&lt;/a&gt; whose members had provided weapons and cash to suspected attackers of the Moscow concert hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Security Service, or FSB, said that on Sunday it detained four suspected members of the cell in the Russian province of Dagestan in the North Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency alleged that the suspects detained in Dagestan were involved in channeling funds and providing weapons to the gunmen who attacked the concert hall on Moscow&apos;s western edge on March 22, killing 144 people in the deadliest attack on Russian soil in two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/russian-special-unit-linked-havana-syndrome-sickened-us-officials-overseas-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUSSIAN SPECIAL UNIT LINKED TO HAVANA SYNDROME THAT SICKENED US OFFICIALS OVERSEAS: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The detained militants directly participated in financing the perpetrators of the March 22 terror &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;attack on the Crocus City Hall&lt;/a&gt; in Moscow and providing them with terror means,&quot; the FSB said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said one of the suspects detained in Dagestan had confessed to personally bringing weapons to the Moscow attackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FSB released a video showing one of the suspects saying that they also planned an attack in the city of Kaspiysk in Dagestan. It wasn’t clear whether the two confessions came from the same person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency said the suspects are foreign nationals, without specifying their nationality. The suspected attackers of the Moscow concert hall arrested hours after the March 22 raid are citizens of the Central Asian nation of Tajikistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The detention of four suspects in Dagestan follows the arrest of the four suspected gunmen and seven others who were accused of involvement in the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged that &quot;radical Islamists&quot; conducted the raid, but alleged - without providing evidence - that Ukraine and the West were involved, despite Kyiv&apos;s vehement denials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>&apos;SNL&apos; torches Biden: Like the Baltimore bridge collapse, he is ‘no longer connecting with Black communities’</title>
                    
                    <description>&amp;quot;Saturday Night Live&amp;quot; cracked a joke comparing the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore and the lack of support for President Biden among Black voters.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/saturday-night-live&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;&lt;/a&gt; took a crack at President Biden during the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment by comparing him to the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;President Biden said Friday that he would visit the site of the Baltimore bridge collapse because, like that bridge, Biden is no longer connecting with Black communities,&quot; comedian Michael Che said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the crowd erupted in laughter, the camera cut to Che&apos;s colleague Colin Jost, who smiled and let out an audible &quot;wow.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You gotta read the polls, Colin,&quot; Che added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/saturday-night-live-takes-aim-biden-allies-argue-president-sharp-behind-closed-doors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&apos;SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE&apos; TAKES AIM AT BIDEN, CLOSE ALLIES WHO CLAIM PRESIDENT IS SHARP &apos;BEHIND CLOSED DOORS&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-continues-bleeding-support-key-voter-groups-dems-sound-alarm-2024-poll&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;USA Today/Suffolk University poll&lt;/a&gt; released in January, Biden&apos;s support among Black voters has fallen to just 63%, down from the 92% that Pew Research Center data shows he won in the 2020 presidential election. His support among Hispanic voters is down to 34% from 59%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;SNL&quot; has become more comfortable in recent months aiming jokes at Biden and his administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early March, &quot;SNL&quot; mocked Biden and his allies, who argue the president is mentally sharp and energetic &quot;behind closed doors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden has even become the butt of jokes in sketch-comedy shows overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/snl-mocked-woke-smugness-claiming-trump-made-up-term-de-banking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;‘SNL’ MOCKED FOR THEIR ‘WOKE SMUGNESS’ AFTER CLAIMING TRUMP MADE UP THE TERM ‘DE-BANKING’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/italian-snl-belittles-biden-season-premiere-parody&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;An Italian comedic sketch show&lt;/a&gt; mocked President Biden&apos;s mental fitness in its eighth season premiere episode on February 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italian comedian Maurizio Crozza played the U.S. president in at least two skits for his one-man sketch show called &quot;Fratelli di Crozza,&quot; where he impersonates various public figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one sketch that went viral on social media, Crozza, as Biden, appears dazed and confused while holding a press conference at the White House. An Italian voice off-screen attempts to guide and correct Crozza as he rambles nonsensically and forgets world leaders&apos; names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Kristine Parks contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Rebel Wilson doubles down on sexual harassment claims against Sacha Baron Cohen: &apos;Humiliated and degraded&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Rebel Wilson is standing by her allegations against Sacha Baron Cohen, saying her claims about his &amp;quot;a--hole&amp;quot; behavior on a movie set were &amp;quot;fully legally vetted.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rebel-wilson-tried-ozempic-weight-loss-journey-those-drugs-can-be-good&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rebel Wilson&lt;/a&gt; isn&apos;t backing down from her shocking claims about former co-star Sacha Baron Cohen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actress wrote about her experience of working with Cohen in her new memoir, &quot;Rebel Rising,&quot; describing how uncomfortable she felt while filming their 2016 film, &quot;The Brothers Grimsby.&quot; Cohen has vehemently denied her claims, and now, Wilson is insisting she&apos;s telling the truth, saying she was &quot;humiliated and degraded as a person&quot; on the movie set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That was something that happened 10 years ago, and obviously I&apos;ve moved past it now, but it was my worst professional experience,&quot; she admitted in an interview on &quot;Today&quot; on Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sacha-baron-cohen-denies-rebel-wilsons-claim-was-a-hole-movie-set&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SACHA BARON COHEN DENIES REBEL WILSON&apos;S CLAIM HE WAS AN ‘A--HOLE’ ON MOVIE SET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just feeling humiliated and degraded as a person, I just thought it&apos;s worth sharing in the book because there&apos;s probably a lot of people out there that have had the same experiences,&quot; she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson also claimed that since her allegations about Cohen&apos;s behavior have been getting attention, &quot;I&apos;ve had a lot of women reach out and say that they&apos;ve had similar experiences with this guy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rebel Rising&quot; is set to release April 2, but she&apos;s spoken about the chapter of her book dedicated to Cohen on social media. She originally neglected to name names, instead referring to him as an &quot;a--hole&quot; that she&apos;d worked with, but after he allegedly attempted to stop her from publishing her book, she called him out directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rebel-wilson-vs-sacha-baron-cohen-actress-may-have-signed-pr-deal-with-devil-expert&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REBEL WILSON VS. SACHA BARON COHEN: ACTRESS MAY HAVE SIGNED ‘A PR DEAL WITH THE DEVIL,&apos; EXPERT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I will not be bullied or silenced by high priced lawyers or PR crisis managers,&quot; Wilson wrote on her Instagram story last week. &quot;The ‘a--hole’ that I am talking about in ONE CHAPTER of my book is: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/sacha-baron-cohen-jewish-celebs-rip-tiktok-creating-biggest-antisemitic-movement-since-nazis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sacha Baron Cohen&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Brothers Grimsby,&quot; Wilson and Cohen starred together as a husband and wife of nine kids. Later, Wilson accused Cohen of &quot;harassing&quot; her on the movie set during a radio show interview, according to Variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

Remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sacha-baron-cohen-stop-playing-borat-too-dangerous&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in ‘Borat’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;when I did that naked scene? It was hilarious,’&quot; Wilson said, the outlet reported. &quot;On the last day, I thought I’d obviously won the argument, and he got a body double to do the naked scene.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen allegedly told Wilson to &quot;stick [her] finger up [his] butt&quot; while filming the last scene, despite the move not being included in the script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look, I’ll just pull down my pants. You just stick your finger up my butt. It’ll be a really funny bit,&quot; he allegedly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for Cohen denied her claims, telling Fox News Digital, &quot;While we appreciate the importance of speaking out, these demonstrably false claims are directly contradicted by extensive detailed evidence, including contemporaneous documents, film footage, and eyewitness accounts from those present before, during and after the production of ‘The Brothers Grimsby.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her new interview, Wilson admitted she wasn&apos;t surprised that Cohen is denying her accusations against him, saying, &quot;Obviously, knowing his character, I assumed he would react in this way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Writing a memoir, the book gets fully legally vetted,&quot; she explained, &quot;so obviously there are tons of people to back what I&apos;m saying in the book, the book is 100% honest and truthful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Lauryn Overhultz contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Shocked merrymakers looked on as the crazed boyfriend of an Irish pub employee allegedly stabbed her multiple times in the neck just after happy hour, leaving her to bleed out and turning the knife on himself, according to a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/ireland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Irish immigrant&lt;/a&gt; Sarah McNally, 41, died on the floor of the Céilí House pub in Queens after the 6:30 p.m. assault on Saturday, a New York Police Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency responders transported a 36-year-old man in &quot;critical condition&quot; with stab wounds to his head and neck to the same hospital where McNally was pronounced dead – the New York Post reported that the man was the bar worker&apos;s boyfriend of several months, and that he injured himself after allegedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;attacking the woman&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McNally was &quot;just standing there talking&quot; when &quot;her [boyfriend] just walked right in and stabbed her,&quot; a female patron told the outlet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/former-nypd-officer-cleared-murder-manslaughter-shooting-childhood-friend&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORMER NYPD OFFICER CLEARED OF MURDER, MANSLAUGHTER IN SHOOTING OF CHILDHOOD FRIEND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then he started trying to stab himself,&quot; she said. &quot;Horrible. Just horrible!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what prompted the barroom slaying. Sources told the outlet that there was no history of domestic violence between the pair before the fatal incident – but he had been arrested for domestic violence before, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; Daily News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charges against the attacker are pending as he recovers from his self-inflicted wounds, the Daily News reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/illinois-stabbing-spree-suspect-charged-murder-rampage-leaves-4-dead-7-injured&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ILLINOIS STABBING SPREE SUSPECT CHARGED WITH MURDER AFTER RAMPAGE LEAVES FOUR DEAD, SEVEN INJURED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patron Mike Green told the outlet that he knew the couple and &quot;still can&apos;t believe it&quot; or &quot;picture it&quot; after the incident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They was always together. M is cool,&quot; Green said, using the boyfriend&apos;s nickname and saying that the couple often hung out at the Maspeth watering hole. &quot;Both of them. That’s why it blew my mind a little bit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sarah is good people,&quot; Green said of the victim. &quot;She helps people. Everybody owes her money.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/jonathan-diller-shooting-nypd-sergeants-union-tells-anti-police-democrats-stay-away-funeral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JONATHAN DILLER SHOOTING: NYPD SERGEANTS&apos; UNION TELLS ANTI-POLICE DEMOCRATS TO STAY AWAY FROM THE FUNERAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources told the Post that the boyfriend held knives in each hand when he was approached by responding police, and that they used stun guns on him when he refused to drop the weapons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McNally was a &quot;sweet, innocent girl from Longford,&quot; a county in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/ireland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;central Ireland,&lt;/a&gt; bar regular Mike Lambe, 62, told the outlet. She had worked at the pub for just a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green told the Daily News that McNally worked as a corrections officer on the Emerald Isle before moving to the States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She was innocent!&quot; said Lambe, who lives just two blocks from the pub, adding that the street has regular issues with drug dealers and users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s been getting worse and worse,&quot; he told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An Israeli airstrike launched at the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria on Monday has killed Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Iran&apos;s Revolutionary Guards Corps&lt;/a&gt;, a Lebanese security source has told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Zahedi, describing him as playing a key role in Iran&apos;s support of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters is reporting that its journalists at the scene in the Syrian capital saw smoke rising from the rubble of a building that was flattened in the airstrike. Israel has not confirmed its involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We do not comment on reports in the foreign media,&quot; an Israeli military spokesperson told Reuters when asked about the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israeli-troops-withdraw-from-shifa-hospital-gaza-idf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISRAELI TROOPS WITHDRAW FROM SHIFA HOSPITAL IN GAZA, IDF SAYS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury said in 2010 that Zahedi &quot;has also acted as a liaison to Hezbollah and Syrian intelligence services and is reportedly charged with guaranteeing weapons shipments to Hezbollah.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The airstrike Monday also killed several Iranian diplomats, Reuters is reporting, citing Iranian state media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah and the Israeli military have frequently been engaged in cross-border skirmishes since the onset of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Israel-Hamas war&lt;/a&gt; on Oct. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-announces-thwarting-massive-iranian-operation-smuggle-weapons-palestinians&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISRAEL ANNOUNCES THWARTING OF MASSIVE IRANIAN OPERATION TO SMUGGLE WEAPONS TO PALESTINIANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel said in February that it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-eliminates-hezbollah-senior-commander-terror-group-warns-pay-price&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;killed a senior Hezbollah commander&lt;/a&gt; in a strike carried out in Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Israel Defense Forces had announced at the time that an overnight airstrike targeting a &quot;Hezbollah military structure&quot; in Nabatieh killed Ali Muhammad Aldbas, a senior commander of the Radwan forces. His deputy commander, Ibrahim Issa, and an additional terrorist were killed in the attack, according to the IDF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Thomas Ferraro and Chris Pandolfo contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>D.C. Defenders offensive lineman Jean Delance was unable to stick around for the first UFL game of the season as he was ejected for spitting on an opponent.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;D.C. Defenders offensive lineman Jean Delance appeared in the team’s first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ufl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;United Football League&lt;/a&gt; game against the San Antonio Brahmas, but he didn’t stick around for the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Defenders attempted to come back against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/san-antonio-brahmas-trickery-results-big-man-touchdown-in-ufl-opener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Brahmas&lt;/a&gt;, Delance was ejected in the fourth quarter for spitting at linebacker Delontae Scott. Delance was hit with a &quot;flagrant personal foul&quot; after it appeared the Defenders had scored a touchdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The score was negated after officials said Delance jumped early on the play. He was thrown out and cost the team a touchdown to get back in the game. D.C. had to settle for four field goals and dropped the opener 27-12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/XFL2023/status/1774505314538107107&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW THE MOMENT ON X.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flagrant play, the UFL broadcast showed Scott warning Defenders quarterback Jordan Ta’amu about Delance spitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey, your boy spit on me again, it’s over,&quot; Scott told Ta’amu. &quot;He spit on me again it’s over.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufl-kicker-praises-god-drilling-game-winning-64-yard-field-goal-first-attempt-since-high-school&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;UFL KICKER PRAISES GOD AFTER DRILLING GAME-WINNING 64-YARD FIELD GOAL IN FIRST ATTEMPT SINCE HIGH SCHOOL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brahmas quarterback Chase Garbers was 19-for-25 passing with 152 passing yards and two touchdown passes. He also ran for a touchdown. Jontre Kirklin had eight catches for 61 yards and a touchdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ta’amu was 25-for-45 with 235 passing yards and an interception. Ty Scott led the team in receiving with four catches for 87 yards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D.C. kicker Matthew McCrane had all 12 points for the Defenders. His longest field goal came in the first quarter when he nailed a 28-yarder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/united-football-league-players-may-know-ahead-1st-season&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt; hits the road to take on the Memphis Showboats next week.

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers in more than a dozen states have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/legislation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;proposed legislation&lt;/a&gt; to allow spiritual chaplains in public schools, a move that proponents say will ease a youth mental health crisis, bolster staff retention and offer spiritual care to students who can’t afford or access religious schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservatives also argue religious foundations will act as a &quot;rescue mission&quot; for what they say are public schools&apos; declining values, a topic that has galvanized Republican-controlled Legislatures to fight for issues such as parental oversight of curriculum, restrictions on books and instruction on gender identity and state-funded tuition assistance for private and religious schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many chaplains and interfaith organizations oppose the chaplaincy campaign, calling the motivation offensive and describing the dangers of introducing a position of authority to children without clear standards or boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They are going to be engaging students, sometimes when they’re at their most vulnerable, and there’s not going to be any checks on whether they’re able to proselytize, what they’re able to say to kids grappling with really difficult issues,&quot; said Maureen O’Leary, organizing director at Interfaith Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organization has shared concerns with lawmakers and school boards, saying schools should be &quot;neutral spaces where students can come as their full selves,&quot; O&apos;Leary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This isn’t a matter of being pro- religion and anti-religion,&quot; she said. &quot;This is a matter of the appropriate role of religion as it applies to public schools.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas became the first state to allow school chaplains under a law passed in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National School Chaplain Association, which identifies itself as a Christian chaplain ministry, says on its website it was &quot;instrumental&quot; in spearheading the Texas law. The organization is a subsidiary of Mission Generation, which was established in 1999 to bring Jesus to classrooms worldwide. In a December 2023 newsletter, NSCA celebrated Texas for starting a &quot;national movement placing God back in public education.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-lawmakers-approve-bill-allowing-public-schools-hire-chaplains-counsel-students&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEXAS LAWMAKERS APPROVE BILL ALLOWING PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO HIRE CHAPLAINS TO COUNSEL STUDENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSCA chaplains &quot;deliver holistic care, guidance, and safety to all people, all the time regardless of their personal beliefs, or non-beliefs&quot; and the organization’s statement of faith is typical of endorsing bodies, an association representative said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bill passed, dozens of Texas chaplains representing different faiths and denominations collectively wrote to school boards, warning the law doesn&apos;t require that &quot;chaplains refrain from proselytizing while at schools or that they serve students from different religious backgrounds.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law ordered more than 1,200 school districts to decide by March 1 whether they would allow chaplains as employees or volunteers. Many of the largest opted out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Houston and Austin said volunteers&apos; roles and responsibilities were unchanged so a volunteer wouldn&apos;t be providing chaplain services. Dallas’ school board said chaplains should not be employees or volunteers at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, varying school chaplain bills have been introduced in many Southern and Midwestern states, with mixed success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A school chaplain bill passed both chambers of the Florida Legislature and awaits Gov. Ron DeSantis&apos;s signature. School policy must describe the services of a volunteer chaplain and require parental consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indiana’s proposal, which passed one chamber but failed in the other, specified chaplains would provide secular services unless student and parents consent to nonsecular services. Some lawmakers questioned where that line would be drawn and how a student would know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Utah, Rep. Keven Stratton told his colleagues recent Supreme Court decisions on religious freedom provide an opportunity for school chaplains and a return to the tradition of acknowledging God in public institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Johnson, his counterpart in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/utah&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Utah Senate&lt;/a&gt;, where the proposal ultimately failed without full GOP support, said he observed an &quot;outright disdain for religious principles within our schools&quot; during committee meetings. He said that would have consequences such as more families choosing alternatives to public school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It would be helpful and much easier if my colleagues would take our efforts here not as an attack but as a rescue mission,&quot; he said on the Senate floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, proposals from then- President Donald Trump to stategoverningbodies have intended to crack the firewall between church and public schools, an effort that civil liberties groups say undermines equal treatment of all faiths and threatens religious minorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public schools have been barred from leading students in classroom prayer since 1962, when the Supreme Court ruled it was a violation of the First Amendment clause forbidding the establishment of a government religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court case brought by a coach fired for praying on the field addressed the balance between the religious and free speech rights of teachers and staff and the rights of students not to feel coerced into religious practices. The decision to back a praying football coach aligned with a series of rulings in favor of religious plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chaplains, traditionally a clergyperson ministering outside of a congregation, have long served in the U.S. But the modern role is &quot;very gray,&quot; said Wendy Cadge, director of the Chaplaincy Innovation Lab at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, in that it&apos;s not uniform or universally understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chaplains serve in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.S. Congress&lt;/a&gt;, military, and correctional facilities, and each has rigorous requirements for hiring and service. Hospitals, police and fire departments, colleges and private companies also hire chaplains with wide-ranging standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many chaplains have seminary or ministry training in and the endorsement of a particular faith. But chaplains serving in multicultural places also may be required to bring professional, supervised training called clinical pastoral education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major hospitals are especially likely to employ chaplains with, and offer training in, clinical pastoral education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients and their families are regularly experiencing existential crises and are vulnerable, said Eric Johnson, director of spiritual care at UnityPoint Health’s Des Moines-area hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The training helps chaplains learn how to serve untethered to their faith so &quot;transference or reactivity doesn’t get in the way of really attending to people’s needs,&quot; Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hip-hop mogul Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs won&apos;t be able to buy his way out of trouble if the federal sex-trafficking probe against him uncovers any crimes, according to a former investigator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the Bad Boy Records founder&apos;s mansions were raided last week after a series of damning civil lawsuits accused him of trafficking sex, guns and drugs and other bad behavior. He settled the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-settles-lawsuit-one-day-after-ex-girlfriend-cassies-allegations-years-rape&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;first lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, from R&amp;amp;B singer Cassie, his ex-girlfriend whose real name is Casandra Ventura, a day after she filed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after she came forward, so did at least three women and a man, including a female who would have been under 18 at the time of her alleged sex assault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You can pay off folks in civil lawsuits to make them go away,&quot; said Nicole Parker, a former FBI agent. &quot;But that doesn’t work in a sound criminal investigation – especially on a federal level when it comes to sex trafficking allegations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-accused-male-music-producer-sexual-assault&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEAN ‘DIDDY’ COMBS ACCUSED BY MALE MUSIC PRODUCER OF SEXUAL ASSAULT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homeland Security Investigations agents descended on Combs&apos; mansions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/los-angeles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; and Miami in connection with what law enforcement sources told Fox News Digital is a sex-trafficking probe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;After the Epstein debacle, folks know you won’t be able to just make these cases disappear,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if the case goes to criminal court, there won&apos;t be a non-disclosure agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derrick Parker, a former member of the NYPD&apos;s rap-related intelligence unit whose book &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Notorious-C-P-Investigations-Hip-Hop/dp/0312352514&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Notorious C.O.P.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; delved into detail about and 1999 shooting in which Combs was acquitted at trial, predicted that more accusers will come forward and share their stories with investigators as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some of it may be a money grab because maybe he was disrespectful, but they saw the way that he paid Cassie off,&quot; he told Fox News Digital. &quot;Cassie got paid quick, and the reason that she got paid quick is because she knows a lot.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The raids came weeks after music producer Rodney Jones&apos; lawsuit accused Combs of all kinds of misdeeds, including sexual grooming, covering up a studio shooting and allegedly bragging about &quot;having law enforcement under control,&quot; &quot;murdering people&quot; and bribing witnesses and jurors in a high-profile New York City nightclub shooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rapper-sean-diddy-combs-homes-raided-homeland-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;RAPPER SEAN &apos;DIDDY&apos; COMBS&apos; HOMES RAIDED BY HOMELAND SECURITY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combs and his then-girlfriend, the pop megastar Jennifer Lopez, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;were arrested&lt;/a&gt; after a December 1999 shooting at Club New York left three people injured. Lopez was never charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combs and another man were acquitted at trial. But his friend and protege, the rapper Jamal &quot;Shyne&quot; Barrow, served a decade in prison for assault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-lawsuit-names-50-cents-ex-girlfriend-one-music-moguls-alleged-sex-workers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEAN &apos;DIDDY&apos; COMBS LAWSUIT NAMES 50 CENT&apos;S EX-GIRLFRIEND AS ONE OF MUSIC MOGUL&apos;S ALLEGED SEX WORKERS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones&apos; lawsuit alleges that Lopez snuck a gun into the club for Combs and handed it to her boyfriend before gunfire erupted and injured three people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A surviving victim, Natania Reuben, told NewsNation last week that she watched Combs shoot her in the face – not Barrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-life-star-island-exclusive-miami-enclave-billionaires-a-listers-call-home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEAN ‘DIDDY’ COMBS&apos; LIFE ON STAR ISLAND: EXCLUSIVE MIAMI ENCLAVE BILLIONAIRES, A-LISTERS CALL HOME&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I literally watched them pull out the guns,&quot; she told the station. &quot;I had a clear point of view. I mean, for God&apos;s sake, I got shot in my nose.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s unlikely that Combs could be in trouble for the nightclub shooting, Parker said, because there&apos;s typically no federal nexus for a local gunfight, especially after he was already acquitted at trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-federal-raids-homes-sexual-misconduct-lawsuits-what-to-know&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEAN ‘DIDDY’ COMBS&apos; FEDERAL RAIDS ON HOMES, SEXUAL MISCONDUCT LAWSUITS: WHAT TO KNOW&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other evidence from the civil lawsuits likely played a role in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;federal investigation&lt;/a&gt; and could turn out to be crucial in a potential criminal case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They’ll use a lot of the same evidence to build their case,&quot; she said. &quot;Anyone is innocent until proven guilty, but the evidence is mounting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-declares-innocence-after-federal-agents-raid-his-homes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEAN ‘DIDDY’ COMBS DECLARES INNOCENCE AFTER FEDERAL AGENTS RAID HIS HOMES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ventura, in her settled lawsuit, had also accused Combs of forcing her to carry a gun for him. Jones alleged that the mogul was often &quot;displaying and distributing guns&quot; in his presence in order to &quot;maintain dominion and control&quot; over other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combs and his lawyers have denied all allegations of wrongdoing. The billionaire has also characterized the accusations against him as attempts for his accusers to secure a &quot;quick payday.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has not been arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photographs taken over the weekend show him in and around his waterfront Miami mansion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Controversial Grand Canyon uranium mining proceeds as US seeks to reduce reliance on Russian supply</title>
                    
                    <description>A uranium mine south of the Grand Canyon faces backlash from a nearby Native American community, highlighting controversy over nuclear projects as Biden seeks to increase nuclear power.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The largest uranium producer in the United States is ramping up work just south of Grand Canyon National Park on a long-contested project that comes as global instability and growing demand drive uranium prices higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration and dozens of other countries have pledged to triple the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/world-leaders-delegations-meet-brussels-promote-nuclear-energy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;capacity of nuclear power&lt;/a&gt; worldwide in their battle against climate change, and policy changes are being adopted by some to lessen Russia&apos;s influence over the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as the U.S. pursues its nuclear power potential, environmentalists and Native American leaders remain fearful of the consequences for communities near mining and milling sites in the West and are demanding more regulatory oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-provide-1-5b-loan-restart-michigan-nuclear-plant&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN ADMIN TO PROVIDE $1.5B LOAN TO RESTART MICHIGAN NUCLEAR PLANT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new mining at Pinyon Plain Mine near the Grand Canyon is happening within the boundaries of the Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukv National Monument that was designated in August by President Joe Biden. The work was allowed to move forward since Energy Fuels Inc. had valid existing rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low impact with zero risk to groundwater is how Energy Fuels spokesman Curtis Moore describes the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mine will cover 17 acres and operate for just a few years, producing at least 2 million pounds of uranium — enough to power the state of Arizona for at least a year with carbon-free electricity, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As the global outlook for clean, carbon-free nuclear energy strengthens and the U.S. moves away from Russian uranium supply, the demand for domestically sourced uranium is growing,&quot; Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy Fuels, which also is prepping two more mines in Colorado and Wyoming, was awarded a contract in 2022 to sell $18.5 million in uranium concentrates to the U.S. government to help establish the nation’s strategic reserve for when supplies might be disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the growing appetite for uranium, a coalition of Native Americans testified before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in late February, asking the panel to pressure the U.S. government to overhaul outdated mining laws and prevent further exploitation of marginalized communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carletta Tilousi, who served for years on the Havasupai Tribal Council, said she and others have written countless letters to state and federal agencies and have sat through hours of meetings with regulators and lawmakers. Her tribe’s reservation lies in a gorge off the Grand Canyon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have been diligently participating in consultation processes,&quot; she said. &quot;They hear our voices. There’s no response.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/leaders-nuclear-fusion-meet-dc-raise-money-race-against-china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEADERS IN NUCLEAR FUSION MEET IN DC TO RAISE MONEY IN RACE AGAINST CHINA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous legal challenges aimed at stopping the Pinyon Plain Mine have repeatedly been rejected by the courts, and top officials in the Biden administration are reticent to weigh in beyond speaking generally about efforts to improve consultation with Native American tribes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s just the latest battle over energy development and sacred lands, as tribes in Nevada and Arizona are fighting the federal government over the mining of lithium and the siting of renewable energy transmission lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Havasupai are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/lithium-extraction-project-using-colorado-river-worries-utah-residents-rely-water&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;concerned mining could affect water supplies&lt;/a&gt;, wildlife, plants and geology throughout the Colorado Plateau, and the Colorado River flowing through the Grand Canyon and its tributaries are vital to millions of people across the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Havasupai, their water comes from aquifers deep below the mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pinyon Plain Mine, formerly known as the Canyon Mine, was permitted in 1984. With existing rights, it was grandfathered into legal operation despite a 20-year moratorium placed on uranium mining in the Grand Canyon region by the Obama administration in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Forest Service in 2012 reaffirmed an environmental impact statement that had been prepared for the mine years earlier, and state regulators signed off on air and aquifer protection permitting within the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We work extremely hard to do our work at the highest standards,&quot; Moore said. &quot;And it’s upsetting that we’re vilified like we are. The things we’re doing are backed by science and the regulators.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regional aquifers feeding the springs at the bottom of the Grand Canyon are deep — around 1,000 feet below the mine — and separated by nearly impenetrable rock, Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State regulators also have said the area&apos;s geology is expected to provide an element of natural protection against water from the site migrating toward the Grand Canyon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, environmentalists say the mine raises bigger questions about the Biden administration’s willingness to adopt favorable nuclear power policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using nuclear power to reach emissions goals is a hard sell in the western U.S. From the Navajo Nation to Ute Mountain Ute and Oglala Lakota homelands, tribal communities have deep-seated distrust of uranium companies and the federal government as abandoned mines and related contamination have yet to be cleaned up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor McKinnon, the Center for Biological Diversity’s Southwest director, said allowing mining near the Grand Canyon &quot;makes a mockery of the administration’s environmental justice rhetoric.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s literally a black eye for the Biden administration,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teracita Keyanna with the Red Water Pond Road Community Association got choked up while testifying before the human rights commission in Washington, D.C., saying federal regulators proposed keeping onsite soil contaminated by past operations in New Mexico rather than removing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s really unfair that we have to deal with this and my children have to deal with this and later on, my grandchildren have to deal with this,&quot; she said. &quot;Why is the government just feeling like we’re disposable? We’re not.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Congress, some lawmakers who come from communities blighted by past contamination are digging in their heels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congresswoman Cori Bush of Missouri said during a congressional meeting in January that lawmakers can’t talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/nuclear&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;expanding nuclear energy&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. without first dealing with the effects that nuclear waste has had on minority communities. In Bush&apos;s district in St. Louis, waste was left behind from the uranium refining required by the top-secret Manhattan Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have a responsibility to both fix — and learn from — our mistakes,&quot; she said, &quot;before we risk subjecting any other communities to the same exposure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We see surveillance cameras, cell phone cameras, home ring cameras. The things that I love about this, [it&apos;s] not just the crimes that you see. You see citizens themselves fighting back, holding these guys accountable,&quot; Larkin said last week on &quot;Fox &amp;amp; Friends.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The 10-episode series &lt;/a&gt;spotlights dramatic crime scenes and showcases how cameras can help land criminals behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-angers-law-enforcement-skipping-nypd-officers-wake-favor-fundraiser-adjust-schedule&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN ANGERS LAW ENFORCEMENT BY SKIPPING NYPD OFFICER&apos;S WAKE IN FAVOR OF FUNDRAISER: ‘ADJUST YOUR SCHEDULE’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larkin, a law enforcement expert, narrates the incidents, offering background on the crimes as they unfold and updates on the victims and criminals themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One sneak peek shown to the &quot;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&quot; audience, for instance, captured a woman who showed up at a police station, armed with the intent to blow through the ballistic glass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She fires around at the door leading to the interior of the station. If she didn&apos;t have the attention of officers before, she does now,&quot; Larkin narrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/menendez-bros-attorney-speaks-out-case-amid-appeal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MENENDEZ BROS&apos; ATTORNEY SPEAKS OUT ABOUT THEIR CASE AMID APPEAL: ‘EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW… YOU DON’T&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told co-host Brian Kilmeade last week that officers tried to negotiate with the suspect to no avail, but, to find out just how the situation ended… viewers will have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;tune in.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/ultimate-evil-ultimate-innocence-mind-idaho-murder-suspect-bryan-kohberger&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘ULTIMATE EVIL MEETING ULTIMATE INNOCENCE:’ INSIDE THE MIND OF IDAHO MURDER SUSPECT BRYAN KOHBERGER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Crime Cam 24/7&quot; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox Nation&apos;s most-watched show&lt;/a&gt; on the platform for two consecutive months when it originally launched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sticks, a &quot;Live PD&quot; alumnus, boasts a distinguished three-decade-long career in law enforcement where he worked on assignments including patrol, narcotics and gangs.

                    <title>Ex-ASPCA chief advocates for local donations, alleges major groups ignore shelters&apos; needs</title>
                    
                    <description>Former ASPCA CEO Ed Sayres told Fox News Digital he encourages those who value supporting their local animal shelters to donate in their community instead of giving to larger groups.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;ASPCA&apos;s former CEO and the godfather behind its iconic Sarah McLachlan ad is encouraging animal lovers to donate locally as he calls out what he views as large animal welfare organizations&apos; failures to support shelters hit hard in the post-pandemic age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For ASPCA, 2% [of proceeds go to local shelters]. So, if you have the visual dollar bill, you would have to tell donors who are donating to such organizations that one penny or two pennies will go to [local shelters],&quot; Ed Sayres told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/special/20th-anniversary/fox-news-digital&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt; on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sayres says his background compels him to advocate for these local establishments that are grappling with an influx of homeless animals while lacking resources to provide adequate care for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now serving as a senior adviser to the Center for the Environment and Welfare (CEW) think tank based in Washington, D.C., Sayres says his focus remains on calling attention to America&apos;s pet shelter crisis and dispelling some commonly-held yet false beliefs about large organizations he says have left local shelters behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aspca-gives-2-budget-pet-shelters-hoarding-millions-pushing-anti-farmer-agenda-think-tank&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ASPCA GIVES 2% OF BUDGET TO PET SHELTERS WHILE ‘HOARDING’ MILLIONS, PUSHING ‘ANTI-FARMER’ AGENDA: THINK TANK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Most donors believe their donations are going locally because they think of those names [of animal welfare groups] as you would think of United Way, that you donate locally through this national umbrella, and it&apos;s not the case,&quot; he continued. &quot;It&apos;s actually brand confusion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many mistakenly assume the ASPCA and other large &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/animal-welfare-groups-biden-admin-address-thousands-abandoned-dogs-border&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;animal welfare groups&lt;/a&gt; function as umbrella organizations – or organizations that control or provide resources to smaller affiliates, but even some note otherwise themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ASPCA&apos;s Frequently Asked Questions page on its website even clarifies this by writing, &quot;We are not an umbrella organization; we do not directly oversee or operate local shelters or rescues, except in New York where the ASPCA Adoption Center is located.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some might confuse local SPCA chapters as affiliates of the ASPCA, though they operate independently and rely on donations. Houston SPCA &lt;a href=&quot;https://houstonspca.org/aspca-vs-spca-whats-the-difference/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;dispelled this myth&lt;/a&gt; on its website in 2021, writing, &quot;While many people believe that the ASPCA funds local shelters like Houston SPCA, no SPCA across the country is part of the ASPCA organization.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/euthanized-tiger-100-animals-seized-virginia-zoo-faces-animal-welfare-investigation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;EUTHANIZED TIGER AMONG MORE THAN 100 ANIMALS SEIZED AS VIRGINIA ZOO FACES ANIMAL WELFARE INVESTIGATION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Rogers, president of New York&apos;s Nassau County SPCA, similarly told CBS News the same year that these independent groups are not funded by the ASPCA, stating, &quot;We receive no money from them at all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sayres, meanwhile, told Fox News Digital that his background compelled him to focus on distributing resources locally when he came to the ASPCA in 2003, and he focused on a grant program to aid local shelters. He says, however, that focus has shifted in the years since he stepped down in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The concern is post-COVID, shelters are really struggling. Shelters need resources,&quot; he said, adding shortly after, &quot;You would think, knowing there&apos;s a bit of a brand confusion, knowing shelters are needing resources and, bottom line, money saves lives, you would think maybe this was the time to get this program started again.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He later explained that families&apos; financial struggles inhibit them from adopting pets, meaning bad economic situations only exacerbate animal shelters&apos; existing problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack Hubbard, executive director of CEW, similarly weighed in on the accusations the ASPCA faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Many donors who have seen the sad Sarah McLachlan-style TV ads are shocked to learn that the ASPCA only gives 2% of its budget to local pet shelters. To make matters worse, they are sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars in investments while paying their CEO over $1 million. We continue to ask the CEO of the ASPCA to reduce his pay and immediately distribute their investment accounts to local shelters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/dogs-cats-roam-free-first-cageless-animal-shelter-us-opens-arkansas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DOGS AND CATS ROAM FREE AS FIRST CAGELESS ANIMAL SHELTER IN US OPENS IN ARKANSAS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hoarding hundreds of millions of dollars while neglecting local pet shelters just isn&apos;t right.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, CEW launched a paid media campaign to &quot;expose the duplicity&quot; of the ASPCA, alleging the nonprofit is more focused on lining its pockets as opposed to helping local pets in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://environmentandwelfare.com/app/uploads/2023/04/CEW_RealASPCA_Report-1.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;CEW sources&lt;/a&gt; provided to Fox News Digital cite the ASPCA&apos;s recent tax filings as the source of its numbers indicating that only 2% of the organization&apos;s budget goes to local shelters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to copies of 2022 ASPCA tax documents CEW additionally provided, CEO Matt Berkshadker raked in over $1 million while many others made six figures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The think tank&apos;s assertions appear to correlate with findings from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aspca-spending-donor-cbs-news-investigation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;CBS News&apos; 2021 report&lt;/a&gt; indicating the organization had raised $2 billion for animal welfare since 2008, but had, in that time, spent approximately 7% in grants to local welfare groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlet&apos;s investigation additionally uncovered that the group spent nearly three times as much on fundraising efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for ASPCA, when reached for comment on CEW&apos;s accusations from a report last year, told Fox News Digital, &quot;For more than 155 years, the ASPCA has been actively pursuing our mission to provide effective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals throughout the United States. All of our lifesaving work is dedicated to rescuing, protecting, and caring for animals in need.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the organization for additional comment, and received the following statement in response:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a false and misleading narrative, peddled by a PR firm paid to discredit the ASPCA’s work to end animal suffering across the country. Based on our most recent tax filings, 76 cents of every dollar spent by the ASPCA goes toward programmatic services that directly advance our lifesaving mission, with the majority of that funding supporting shelters and rescues across the country, including our animal relocation program – the largest in the country – where we move tens of thousands of homeless pets each year from overcrowded shelters to areas of the country where they can be adopted into loving homes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Under current leadership, the ASPCA has evolved and expanded our work to bring even greater urgency and impact to tackling the root causes of animal homelessness and suffering. Every year, our hands-on work – in addition to our partnerships with hundreds of local shelters and rescues – directly impacts hundreds of thousands of animals, with our lasting solutions benefiting millions more that we cannot serve through local partnerships and grant funding alone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Editor&apos;s Note: This piece has been updated to include a statement from ASPCA.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Houston Keene and Aaron Kleigman contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Former RNC chair Reince Priebus, an ABC contributor, called out NBC News on Sunday for its “huge failure&amp;quot; in the wake of the Ronna McDaniel firing scandal.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former RNC chair Reince Priebus called out NBC News on Sunday for its &quot;huge failure&quot; in the hiring and firing of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nbc-news-decision-part-ronna-mcdaniel-looks-soft-weak-and-scared-soccer-great-alexi-lalas-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ronna McDaniel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDaniel stepped down as head of the RNC on March 8, only to become the center of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;media world&lt;/a&gt; controversy after she joined NBC News as a contributor, only to have her contract terminated by the company amid backlash from employees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priebus, who is an ABC contributor, said that NBC flubbed the hiring of McDaniel on &quot;This Week.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-nbc-leaders-caught-flat-footed-touch-staff-ronna-mcdaniel-fiasco-insider&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MSNBC, NBC LEADERS WERE CAUGHT FLAT-FOOTED, OUT OF TOUCH WITH STAFF ON RONNA MCDANIEL FIASCO: INSIDER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The case on Ronna that I find to be obvious for someone like me who’s a contributor here, I&apos;ve been at other places — I’ve never been hired without the management bringing me in, meeting with people, doing interviews where I wasn’t on a signed contract, finding out whether I could get off the talking points or not,&quot; Priebus said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The root of the problem is that the management never brought [McDaniel] in before the contract was signed so that all of this stuff could get worked out, and that was a huge failure in my opinion,&quot; he continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Donna Brazile said that she didn&apos;t have a response to McDaniel&apos;s firing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;I didn’t understand the hiring,&quot; Brazile said. &quot;So I have none. But I’ve enjoyed every year of my life being on shows like this and cable television.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Good luck to her,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to NBC News for comment but has yet to receive a response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/nbc-news-officially-drops-ronna-mcdaniel-following-staff-backlash&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NBC NEWS OFFICIALLY DROPS RONNA MCDANIEL FOLLOWING ON-AIR BACKLASH FROM STAFF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly one week after proudly announcing the hiring of McDaniel, the former chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, as a paid analyst, NBC is still reeling after an unprecedented tongue-lashing from its own stars, media critics and even prominent Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDaniel is seeking all $600,000 from her lucrative contract. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/conservatives-pile-nbc-news-dropping-ronna-mcdaniel-days-after-hiring-gotta-be-a-new-record&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Republicans and conservatives&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; observing the fiasco were left with even less trust in NBC News and the media writ large than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former high-ranking MSNBC executive previously told Fox News Digital, &quot;There’s now an obvious line drawn between NBC/MSNBC anchors and correspondents, and the executives who oversee them. The talent doesn’t trust the execs and the execs don’t trust the talent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; David Rutz and Brian Flood contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;President Biden touted the &quot;best economy in the world&quot; during an Easter Monday interview and argued people were going to turn out and vote in 2024 because they&apos;re &quot;sick of the negativity.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-still-not-prepared-announce-2024-presidential-run&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Al Roker interviewed the president&lt;/a&gt; for NBC&apos;s &quot;Today&quot; show ahead of the White House&apos;s annual Easter egg roll and asked Biden to respond to people who might be hesitant about voting in the 2024 election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think people are going to surprise people again. They&apos;re going to engage. We have an overwhelming response while we’re on the road. Look, we have tens of thousands of people contributing $5, $10 a pop. We have opened up 100 headquarters. We have people waiting to just get engaged. I just think people are so tired of the negativity that is propagated that they just want to get engaged. They want to change things. I’m optimistic, I really am,&quot; Biden responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/colbert-jokes-biden-mentally-fit-run-president-easter-egg-gaffe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLBERT JOKES ABOUT WHETHER BIDEN IS ‘MENTALLY FIT’ TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN AFTER EASTER EGG GAFFE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roker followed up with a question about the economy and people who aren&apos;t feeling good about their economic situations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, I&apos;d say we have the best economy in the world. We have got to make it better. We really do have the best economy in the world,&quot; Biden said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then referred to the lasting impact of the pandemic, &quot;Jobs are up more than they have ever been. We’re in a situation where the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years is maintained. We have people just – but people, look, I think we’re going to find out that what happened was a consequence of the crisis we had in health, is going to have a lasting effect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We just have to get people to move again. We’re ready. We will come together in a way that, I mean that sincerely. I’m truly optimistic,&quot; the president continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Lady Jill Biden stood alongside the president for the interview and Roker asked her how she was feeling about the election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I feel great. I have been traveling across the country. People are ready to go, and we’re going to win this,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/messed-americans-react-bidens-handling-economy-bidenomics-push&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;‘MESSED UP&apos;: AMERICANS REACT TO BIDEN’S HANDLING OF THE ECONOMY AND ‘BIDENOMICS’ PUSH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-half-voters-worse-off-2020&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;A Fox News poll&lt;/a&gt; released on March 27 found that over half of voters feel they&apos;re worse off today than in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poll also found that 73% of voters rate the economy negatively, which is a slight improvement compared to May 2023, when 83% of voters rated the economy negatively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-eight percent approve of Biden’s handling of the economy, while 61% disapprove, the poll found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy, election integrity, immigration, and health care are the top issues for voters as they decide which presidential candidate to support, with nearly half or more saying each is extremely important. Fewer feel that way about abortion, foreign policy, and climate change, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; poll found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Dana Blanton contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A Tennessee aquarium watched as seven endangered turtles recently hatched at their facility. The Arakan forest turtles are considered critically endangered.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A bale of Arakan forest turtles — a critically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/endangered-species&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;endangered species&lt;/a&gt; — were welcomed to the world recently at an aquarium in Tennessee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tennessee Aquarium in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chattanooga, Tennessee,&lt;/a&gt; announced the arrival of seven hatchlings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aquarium put out a press release with the good news and shared that it’s rare for all seven of the eggs that were laid to fully emerge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/rare-animals-arrival-will-help-reveal-secrets-of-one-of-least-known-species-on-the-planet&quot;

are endangered due to habitat destruction in Myanmar and Bangladesh and the &quot;unwelcomed attention of illegal traffickers supplying the pet trade and food markets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/exotic-animals-across-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHERE TO HAVE UP-CLOSE ENCOUNTERS WITH EXOTIC ANIMALS ACROSS AMERICA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The turtles’ population has decreased 80% over the last 75 years, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new arrivals in Tennessee are considered the largest group of Arakan forest turtles ever to hatch at a facility accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), according to the Tennessee Aquarium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aquarium said that these turtles can only be found at six facilities nationwide due to their rarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time the Tennessee Aquarium has stuck gold with birthing new Arakan forest turtles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/rare-two-headed-snake-undergoes-surgery-missouri&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RARE TWO-HEADED SNAKE UNDERGOES SURGERY IN MISSOURI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the aquarium welcomed its first-ever Arakans ­— two turtles that emerged from six eggs that were laid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last year alone, the Tennessee Aquarium said that the population of Arakan forest turtles in AZA facilities like its own has increased by 27%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hughes said that &quot;having a viable population spread across zoos and aquariums is important.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, &quot;Then, if something happened to the last few in the wild, they wouldn’t totally be extinct.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot;

said the same organization. &quot;This turtle has been observed burrowing under leaves during the hottest parts of the day, and is largely active at night.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the Tennessee Aquarium for additional comment and updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot;

                    <title>Gmail revolutionized email 20 years ago — after being initially mistaken as Google&apos;s April Fools&apos; Day joke</title>
                    
                    <description>Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, renowned for their April Fools&amp;apos; Day pranks, unveiled a groundbreaking innovation on the annual occasion: Gmail.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Google co-founders&lt;/a&gt; Larry Page and Sergey Brin loved pulling pranks, so much so they began rolling outlandish ideas every April Fools&apos; Day not long after starting their company more than a quarter century ago. One year, Google posted a job opening for a Copernicus research center on the moon. Another year, the company said it planned to roll out a &quot;scratch and sniff&quot; feature on its search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jokes were so consistently over-the-top that people learned to laugh them off as another example of Google mischief. And that&apos;s why Page and Brin decided to unveil something no one would believe was possible 20 years ago on April Fools&apos; Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Gmail, a free service boasting 1 gigabyte of storage per account, an amount that sounds almost pedestrian in an age of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/iphone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;one-terabyte iPhones&lt;/a&gt;. But it sounded like a preposterous amount of email capacity back then, enough to store about 13,500 emails before running out of space compared to just 30 to 60 emails in the then-leading webmail services run by Yahoo and Microsoft. That translated into 250 to 500 times more email storage space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/a-new-company-could-aim-dethrone-google-search-king-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A NEW COMPANY COULD AIM TO DETHRONE GOOGLE AS THE SEARCH KING: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the quantum leap in storage, Gmail also came equipped with Google&apos;s search technology so users could quickly retrieve a tidbit from an old email, photo or other personal information stored on the service. It also automatically threaded together a string of communications about the same topic so everything flowed together as if it was a single conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The original pitch we put together was all about the three ‘S’s&quot; — storage, search and speed,&quot; said former Google executive Marissa Mayer, who helped design Gmail and other company products before later becoming Yahoo&apos;s CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was such a mind-bending concept that shortly after The Associated Press published a story about Gmail late on the afternoon of April Fools&apos; 2004, readers began calling and emailing to inform the news agency it had been duped by Google&apos;s pranksters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That was part of the charm, making a product that people won&apos;t believe is real. It kind of changed people’s perceptions about the kinds of applications that were possible within a web browser,&quot; former Google engineer Paul Buchheit recalled during a recent AP interview about his efforts to build Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/google-interfered-elections-41-times-last-16-years-media-research-center-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOOGLE HAS ‘INTERFERED’ WITH ELECTIONS 41 TIMES OVER THE LAST 16 YEARS, MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER SAYS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took three years to do as part of a project called &quot;Caribou&quot; — a reference to a running gag in the Dilbert comic strip. &quot;There was something sort of absurd about the name Caribou, it just made make me laugh,&quot; said Buchheit, the 23rd employee hired at a company that now employs more than 180,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AP knew Google wasn&apos;t joking about Gmail because an AP reporter had been abruptly asked to come down from San Francisco to the company&apos;s Mountain View, California, headquarters to see something that would make the trip worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After arriving at a still-developing corporate campus that would soon blossom into what became known as the &quot;Googleplex,&quot; the AP reporter was ushered into a small office where Page was wearing an impish grin while sitting in front of his laptop computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page, then just 31 years old, proceeded to show off Gmail&apos;s sleekly designed inbox and demonstrated how quickly it operated within Microsoft&apos;s now-retired Explorer web browser. And he pointed out there was no delete button featured in the main control window because it wouldn&apos;t be necessary, given Gmail had so much storage and could be so easily searched. &quot;I think people are really going to like this,&quot; Page predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with so many other things, Page was right. Gmail now has an estimated 1.8 billion active accounts — each one now offering 15 gigabytes of free storage bundled with Google Photos and Google Drive. Even though that&apos;s 15 times more storage than Gmail initially offered, it&apos;s still not enough for many users who rarely see the need to purge their accounts, just as Google hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The digital hoarding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/email&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;of email&lt;/a&gt;, photos and other content is why Google, Apple and other companies now make money from selling additional storage capacity in their data centers. (In Google&apos;s case, it charges anywhere from $30 annually for 200 gigabytes of storage to $250 annually for 5 terabytes of storage). Gmail&apos;s existence is also why other free email services and the internal email accounts that employees use on their jobs offer far more storage than was fathomed 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were trying to shift the way people had been thinking because people were working in this model of storage scarcity for so long that deleting became a default action,&quot; Buchheit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gmail was a game changer in several other ways while becoming the first building block in the expansion of Google&apos;s internet empire beyond its still-dominant search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Gmail came Google Maps and Google Docs with word processing and spreadsheet applications. Then came the acquisition of video site YouTube, followed by the introduction of the the Chrome browser and the Android operating system that powers most of the world&apos;s smartphones. With Gmail&apos;s explicitly stated intention to scan the content of emails to get a better understanding of users&apos; interests, Google also left little doubt that digital surveillance in pursuit of selling more ads would be part of its expanding ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it immediately generated a buzz, Gmail started out with a limited scope because Google initially only had enough computing capacity to support a small audience of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When we launched, we only had 300 machines and they were really old machines that no one else wanted,&quot; Buchheit said, with a chuckle. &quot;We only had enough capacity for 10,000 users, which is a little absurd.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that scarcity created an air of exclusivity around Gmail that drove feverish demand for an elusive invitations to sign up. At one point, invitations to open a Gmail account were selling for $250 apiece on eBay. &quot;It became a bit like a social currency, where people would go, ‘Hey, I got a Gmail invite, you want one?’&quot; Buchheit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although signing up for Gmail became increasingly easier as more of Google&apos;s network of massive data centers came online, the company didn&apos;t begin accepting all comers to the email service until it opened the floodgates as a Valentine&apos;s Day present to the world in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later on April Fools&apos; Day in 2007, Google would announce a new feature called &quot;Gmail Paper&quot; offering users the chance to have Google print out their email archive on &quot;94% post-consumer organic soybean sputum &quot; and then have it sent to them through the Postal Service. Google really was joking around that time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>South Korean president calls doctors&apos; strike &apos;grave threat to our society,&apos; refuses to concede</title>
                    
                    <description>South Korea&amp;apos;s president said he would not give in to striking doctors&amp;apos; opposition to dramatically increasing medical student quotas, claiming the country needs more doctors.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s president vowed Monday not to back down in the face of vehement protests by doctors seeking to derail his plan to drastically increase medical school admissions, as he called their walkouts &quot;an illegal collective action&quot; that poses &quot;a grave threat to our society.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 12,000 medical interns and residents in South Korea have been on strike for six weeks, causing hundreds of canceled surgeries and other treatments at university hospitals. In support of their action, many senior doctors at their teaching schools &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/south-korea-doctors-strike-escalates-senior-doctors-resign&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;have also submitted resignations&lt;/a&gt; though they haven’t stopped treating patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials say they want to raise the yearly medical school cap by 2,000 from the current 3,058 to create more doctors to deal with the country’s rapidly aging population. Doctors counter that schools can’t handle such an abrupt increase in students and that it would eventually hurt the country’s medical services. But critics say doctors, one of the best-paid professions in South Korea, are simply worried that the supply of more doctors would result in lower future incomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/kim-jong-un-praises-top-tank-unit-encourages-war-preparations-tensions-south-korea&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KIM JONG UN PRAISES TOP TANK UNIT, ENCOURAGES WAR PREPARATIONS AMID TENSIONS WITH SOUTH KOREA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public surveys show that a majority of ordinary South Koreans support the government plan. But observers say many people are increasingly fed up with the protracted confrontation between the government and doctors, threatening to deal a blow to governing party candidates ahead of next week’s parliamentary elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a nationally televised address, President Yoon Suk Yeol said adding 2,000 medical students is the minimum increase needed to address a shortage of physicians in rural areas, the military and essential but low-paying professions like pediatrics and emergency departments. Yoon said South Korea&apos;s doctor-to-patient ratio — 2.1 physicians per 1,000 people — is far below the average of 3.7 in the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Increasing the number of doctors is a state project that we can&apos;t further delay,&quot; Yoon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoon urged the striking doctors to return to work, saying they have a responsibility to protect people&apos;s lives in line with the local medical law. He also said the government remains open to talks if doctors come up with a unified proposal that adequately explains their calls for a much smaller increase in the medical school enrollment quota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can&apos;t tolerate an attempt to carry through their thoughts by force without due logic and grounds,&quot; Yoon said. &quot;The illegal collective action by some doctors has become a grave threat to our society.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoon said the recruitment plan won&apos;t lead to lower earnings for doctors, citing what he called expected increases in national income and demand for medical services in the fast-aging society. He said the average income of South Korean doctors is the highest in the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later Monday, the Korean Medical Association, which represents doctors in South Korea, criticized Yoon for repeating what his government has already argued to support the recruitment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was an address that brought us greater disappointment because we had high hopes&quot; for some changes in the government&apos;s position, Kim Sung-geun, a spokesperson for KMA’s emergency committee, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoon said the government is taking final administrative &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/why-south-korea-suspend-striking-doctors-licenses-en-masse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;steps to suspend the licenses&lt;/a&gt; of the strikers but added he doesn&apos;t want to punish the young doctors. This implies that his government is willing to soften punitive measures on the strikers if they return to work soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoon recently ordered officials to pursue &quot;a flexible measure&quot; to resolve the dispute and seek constructive consultations with doctors at the request of ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s unclear if the government and doctors can find a breakthrough to settle their standoff anytime soon. Last week, KMA elected Lim Hyun-taek, a hardliner who has called for a decrease in the medical school admission cap, as its new chief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his election Tuesday, Lim said that doctors can sit down for talks with the government if Yoon apologizes and dismisses top health officials involved in the recruitment plan. Lim also threatened to launch an all-out fight if any doctors receive punitive steps over their recent protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The striking junior doctors represent a fraction of the total doctors &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/south-korea&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in South Korea&lt;/a&gt; — estimated at 115,000 by Yoon and 140,000 by a doctors&apos; association. But in some major hospitals, they account for about 30% to 40% of doctors, assisting qualified doctors and department chiefs during surgeries and other treatments while training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say the government enrollment plan lacks measures to resolve key medical issues such as how to increase the number of physicians in some key but unpopular professions. They say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also likely result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Israel attempts to pressure Netanyahu as thousands gather for the largest protest since war began</title>
                    
                    <description>Thousands of Israelis gathered in Jerusalem on Sunday for the largest protest since war began on Oct. 7 in an attempt to put pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tens of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;thousands of Israelis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;thronged central Jerusalem on Sunday in the largest anti-government protest since the country went to war in October. Protesters urged the government to reach a cease-fire deal to free dozens of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas militants and to hold early elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israeli society was broadly united immediately after Oct. 7, when Hamas killed some 1,200 people during a cross-border attack and took 250 others hostage. Nearly six months of conflict have renewed divisions over the leadership of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/benjamin-netanyahu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a&gt;, though the country remains largely in favor of the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas and bring all the hostages home, yet those goals have been elusive. While Hamas has suffered heavy losses, it remains intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-ahead-surgery-vows-israel-invade-rafah-despite-pressure-ramadan-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NETANYAHU, AHEAD OF SURGERY, VOWS ISRAEL WILL INVADE RAFAH, DESPITE PRESSURE FROM RAMADAN, US&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half the hostages in Gaza were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November. But attempts by international mediators to bring home the remaining hostages have failed. Talks resumed on Sunday with no signs that a breakthrough was imminent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hostages&apos; families believe time is running out, and they are getting more vocal about their displeasure with Netanyahu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We believe that no hostages will come back with this government because they’re busy putting sticks in the wheels of negotiations for the hostages,&quot; said Boaz Atzili, whose cousin, Aviv Atzili and his wife, Liat, were kidnapped on Oct. 7. Liat was released but Aviv was killed, and his body is in Gaza. &quot;Netanyahu is only working in his private interests.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters blame Netanyahu for the failures of Oct. 7 and say the deep political divisions over his attempted judicial overhaul last year weakened Israel ahead of the attack. Some accuse him of damaging relations with the United States, Israel’s most important ally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu is also facing a litany of corruption charges which are slowly making their way through the courts, and critics say his decisions appear to be focused on political survival over the national interest. Opinion polls show Netanyahu and his coalition trailing far behind their rivals if elections were held today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless his governing coalition falls apart sooner, Netanyahu won&apos;t face elections until spring of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many families of hostages had refrained from publicly denouncing Netanyahu to avoid antagonizing the leadership and making the hostages&apos; plight a political issue. But as their anger grows, some now want to change course — and they played a major role in Sunday’s anti-government protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crowd on Sunday stretched for blocks around the Knesset, or parliament building, and organizers vowed to continue the demonstration for several days. They urged the government to hold new elections nearly two years ahead of schedule. Thousands also demonstrated Sunday in Tel Aviv, where there was a large protest the night before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu, in a nationally televised speech before undergoing hernia surgery later Sunday, said he understood families&apos; pain. But he said calling new elections — in what he described as a moment before victory — would paralyze Israel for six to eight months and stall the hostage talks. For now, Netanyahu’s governing coalition appears to remain firmly intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jewish-group-deliver-180k-letters-white-house-mark-180-days-oct-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JEWISH GROUP TO DELIVER 180K LETTERS TO WHITE HOUSE TO MARK 180 DAYS SINCE OCT. 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some hostage families agree that now is not the time for elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don’t think that changing the prime minister now is what will advance and help my son to come home,&quot; Sheli Shem Tov, whose son Omer was kidnapped from a music festival, told Israel’s Channel 12. &quot;To go to elections now will just push to the side the most burning issue, which is to return the hostages home.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his Sunday address, Netanyahu also repeated his vow for a military ground offensive in Rafah, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/middle-east&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;southern Gaza city&lt;/a&gt; where more than half of territory&apos;s population of 2.3 million now shelters after fleeing fighting elsewhere. &quot;There is no victory without going into Rafah,&quot; he said, adding that U.S. pressure would not deter him. Israel&apos;s military says Hamas battalions remain there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another reminder of Israel&apos;s divisions, a group of reservists and retired officers demonstrated in an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-Orthodox men for generations have received exemptions from military service, which is compulsory for most Jewish men and women. Resentment over that has deepened during the war. Netanyahu’s government has been ordered to present a new plan for a more equitable draft law by Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu, who relies heavily on the support of ultra-Orthodox parties, last week asked for an extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Israel said in its annual report on Sunday that there could be economic damage if large numbers of ultra-Orthodox men continue not to serve in Israel’s military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also Sunday, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent camp in the courtyard of a crowded hospital in central Gaza, killing two Palestinians and wounding another 15, including journalists working nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Associated Press reporter filmed the strike and aftermath at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, where thousands of people have sheltered. The Israeli military said it struck a command center of the Islamic Jihad militant group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of people have sought shelter in Gaza&apos;s hospitals, viewing them as relatively safe from airstrikes. Israel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;accuses Hamas&lt;/a&gt; and other militants of operating in and around medical facilities, which Gaza&apos;s health officials deny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israeli-strikes-lebanon-kill-16-militant-rockets-kill-1-israeli-cross-border-violence-soars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISRAELI STRIKES IN LEBANON KILL 16, MILITANT ROCKETS KILL 1 ISRAELI AS CROSS-BORDER VIOLENCE SOARS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israeli troops have been raiding Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest, for nearly two weeks and say they have killed scores of fighters, including senior Hamas operatives. Gaza&apos;s Health Ministry said more than 100 patients remain with no potable water and septic wounds, while doctors use plastic bags for gloves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not far from Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, dozens of members of Gaza&apos;s tiny Palestinian Christian community gathered at the Holy Family Church to celebrate Easter, with incense wafting through the rare building that appeared untouched by war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are here with sadness,&quot; attendee Winnie Tarazi said. About 600 people shelter in the compound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations and partners warn that famine could occur in devastated, largely isolated northern Gaza. Humanitarian officials say deliveries by sea and air are not enough and that Israel must allow far more aid by road. Egypt has said thousands of trucks are waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel says it places no limits on deliveries of humanitarian aid. It has blamed the U.N. and other international agencies for the failure to distribute more aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaza’s Health Ministry said Sunday that at least 32,782 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war. The ministry&apos;s count does not differentiate between civilians and fighters, but it has said that women and children make up around two-thirds of those killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel says over one-third of the dead are militants, though it has not provided evidence, and it blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the group operates in residential areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid concerns about a wider conflict in the region, Lebanese state media reported that an Israeli drone struck a car in the southern Lebanese town of Konin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Lebanese security official told The Associated Press that Hezbollah militant Ismail al-Zain was killed, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. Israel&apos;s military called al-Zain a &quot;significant commander.&quot; Hezbollah confirmed the death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late Sunday, a Palestinian attacker stabbed three people in southern Israel, seriously wounding them, said the Hatzalah rescue service. Police said the attacker was shot, but gave no further details on his condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>American passengers on a Norwegian Cruise were stranded on an island Friday, and the group, including a man without his heart medicine, still hasn&amp;apos;t reconnected with the ship</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Six American &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/cruises&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;cruise passengers&lt;/a&gt;, including a pregnant woman, and two Australians were stranded on an African island during a vacation getaway, according to reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it&apos;s only gotten worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/south-carolina&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; couple – Jill and Jay Campbell – said Norwegian Cruise Line left the group on the island of São Tomé, a Central African island nearly 6,000 miles from their home, without their belongings, and allegedly refused to let them board, despite the Coast Guard&apos;s help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They worked with the U.S. Embassy in Angola and planned to fly to the Gambia in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/africa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;West Africa&lt;/a&gt; to meet them at the next port, but the ship wasn&apos;t able to dock because of low tides, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpde.com/news/local/garden-city-couples-frantic-bid-to-reunite-with-stranded-ship-in-africa-continues&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;ABC 15 News,&lt;/a&gt; so the group remains in scramble mode. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/nurse-helping-americans-alleged-bahamas-attack-scared-what-she-saw-couldve-been-daughters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NURSE HELPING AMERICANS IN ALLEGED BAHAMAS ATTACK WAS ‘SCARED’ BY WHAT SHE SAW: ‘COULD’VE BEEN MY DAUGHTERS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norwegian Cruise Line didn&apos;t immediately respond to Fox News Digital&apos;s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cruise line said in a statement to news outlets over the weekend that the passengers were left on the island &quot;on their own or with a private tour&quot; and missed the all-aboard time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/norwegian-cruise-lines-security-guard-used-size-strength-attacked-passenger-lawsuit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINES SECURITY GUARD ‘USED HIS SIZE AND STRENGTH’ AND ATTACKED PASSENGER: LAWSUIT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Campbells, who live in Garden City, South Carolina, said they were eight days into a 21-day cruise and touring the beautiful tourist island when there was &quot;an issue&quot; and the tour guide &quot;didn&apos;t get us back&quot; to the cruise in time on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their tardiness, the cruise was still anchored on the island when they returned and the island&apos;s Coast Guard took them on a boat to the ship, but the captain refused to let the group board, WRAL.com reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. couple said they&apos;re with some elderly passengers, including one passenger with a heart condition who&apos;s been without his medicine for five days, a paraplegic and a pregnant woman from Delaware, according to Fox Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were waiting for the tender boats to come back and get us because our boat was anchored off the harbor, but they didn’t come back to get us. So, we’re stranded here,&quot; Jay Campbell told Local &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ksnblocal4.com/2024/03/30/were-stranded-here-couple-says-cruise-line-abandoned-them-african-island/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;4 KSNB Hastings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed like the situation was going to be rectified by Sunday, but the cruise wasn&apos;t able to dock at the meetup point in the Gambia and now they&apos;re headed to a port in Senegal, where the cruise is scheduled to dock on Tuesday, ABC 15 reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/mom-american-bahamas-sex-attack-says-daughter-texted-weve-been-raped&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;EXCLUSIVE: MOM OF AMERICANS IN BAHAMAS SEX ATTACK REVEALS DAUGHTER&apos;S HEART-STOPPING TEXT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They&apos;re going through the logistics of that headache. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What we looked at was some type of van transportation for eight people, the quadriplegic woman included, driving from here,&quot; Jay Campbell told ABC 15 News. &quot;We have to cross the ferry to get into Senegal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We just learned from the gentleman that the ferry hadn’t been working, but he said no problem, if the ferry is not working we will get another little boat and then pick up a car on the other side. And then once we get on the other side of Senegal, it’s another four-hour drive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH: TIPS FOR CRUISE VACATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cruise line responded to the accusations on Friday – before the latest docking issue in the Gambia – saying it&apos;s &quot;a very unfortunate situation&quot; in a statement to the local South Carolina Fox outlet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Guests are responsible for ensuring they return to the ship at the published time, which is communicated broadly over the ship’s intercom, in the daily communication and posted just before exiting the vessel,&quot; a spokesperson for the cruise line said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/warning-cruise-passengers-sexual-assaults-hit-new-high-2023-sailings-fbi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WARNING FOR CRUISE PASSENGERS AS SEXUAL ASSAULTS HIT NEW HIGH IN 2023: FBI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many of the passengers were separated from their belongings that are still in their cabins, including money, medicine, vaccination certifications required by immigration, among other important items, according to Fox Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have never had an experience like this before,&quot; Jill Campbell told WRAL News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cruise line released this statement to the media over the weekend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While this is a very unfortunate situation, guests are responsible for ensuring they return to the ship at the published time, which is communicated broadly over the ship’s intercom, in the daily communication and posted just before exiting the vessel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Guests are responsible for any necessary travel costs to rejoin the ship at the next available port of call. When the guests did not return to the vessel at the all-aboard time, their passports were delivered to the local port agents to retrieve when they returned to the port.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our team has been working closely with the local authorities to understand the requirements and necessary visas needed if the guests were to rejoin the ship at the next available port of call. We are in communication with the guests and providing additional information as it becomes available.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Alex Murdaugh sentenced to 40 years for financial crimes after polygraph controversy</title>
                    
                    <description>Alex Murdaugh was sentenced to 40 years in a federal South Carolina courtroom on Monday. Murdaugh previously pleaded guilty to 22 federal financial crimes in September 2023.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A federal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/south-carolina&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; judge sentenced Alex Murdaugh to another 480 months, or 40 years, in prison on Monday after the former personal injury lawyer pleaded guilty to 22 federal financial crimes charges in September of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard M. Gergel&lt;/a&gt; said he was committed to impose 480 months and mandatory restitution totaling more than $9 million. Because the defendant does not have the ability to pay restitution, however, Gergel waived the fee and required Murdaugh to pay $2,000 in special assessment immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I do want you to know and all of the victims to know I am filled with sorrow. I am filled with remorse. I am filled with guilt,&quot; Murdaugh said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muraugh&apos;s attorney, Jim Griffin, told reporters outside the Charleston courthouse on Monday that he&apos;s not sure how much of the 40-year sentence his client will end up serving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/alex-murdaughs-lawyers-public-statements-stolen-money-fbi-says-murdaugh-lied&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALEX MURDAUGH&apos;S LAWYERS WANT TO MAKE PUBLIC STATEMENTS ABOUT STOLEN MONEY. FBI SAYS MURDAUGH LIED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Federal inmates are doing approximately 60% of their sentence. So at 40 years, that would equate to 24 years,&quot; Griffin said, adding that &quot;things can change over time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Bland, an attorney representing victims of Murdaugh&apos;s financial crimes, including Gloria Satterfield&apos;s family, said it was &quot;offensive&quot; to equate Murdaugh&apos;s victims with the victims of Bernie Madoff, Samuel Bankman-Fried, or Enron victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/alex-murdaugh-court-clerk-becky-hill-resigns-after-allegations-jury-tampering&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ALEX MURDAUGH COURT CLERK BECKY HILL RESIGNS AFTER ALLEGATIONS OF JURY TAMPERING&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These victims were not investing money. They lost their loved ones. … And Alex Murdaugh took advantage of that,&quot; Bland said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murdaugh, 55, is already serving a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;life sentence for fatally shooting&lt;/a&gt; his wife, Maggie, and youngest son, Paul, in June 2021 on their family&apos;s hunting estate in Colleton County. Prosecutors argued that their murders were an attempt to distract from Murdaugh&apos;s mounting financial crimes, which were beginning to come to light around that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disgraced South Carolina lawyer was also sentenced to 27 years for his financial crimes in a state case in November of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors recommended a sentence of 17 to 22 years in prison for the nearly two-dozen crimes, including bank fraud, wire fraud and money laundering, stemming from Murdaugh&apos;s schemes to steal millions from his clients and the firm where he served as partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/south-carolina-judge-denies-alex-murdaugh-request-new-murder-trial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SOUTH CAROLINA JUDGE DENIES ALEX MURDAUGH&apos;S REQUEST FOR A NEW MURDER TRIAL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In court documents filed last week, however, federal prosecutors alleged that Murdaugh failed part of a polygraph test regarding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;$6 million in stolen funds,&lt;/a&gt; violating his plea agreement. His defense attorneys, Jim Griffin and Dick Harpootlian, are asking a judge to dismiss the allegations and said they want to publicize Murdaugh&apos;s statements from the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Monday&apos;s hearing, the defense asked for a motion to review the polygraph test. Judge Gergel said the motion was withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[T]he polygraph examination that forms the basis of the Government’s motion was plagued by many irregularities and violated in material respects the standards for designing appropriate polygraph questions,&quot; Murdaugh&apos;s attorneys wrote. &quot;For these reasons, the Government should not be permitted to rely on the results of that polygraph examination in the first instance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the state case, prosecutors said Murdaugh used his power and family influence in the Lowcountry to take on clients&apos; cases, win them &quot;significant funds&quot; and then keep a decent portion of the earnings for himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/alex-murdaugh-push-new-trial-could-depend-one-juror-attorney-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ALEX MURDAUGH&apos;S PUSH FOR NEW TRIAL COULD DEPEND ON ONE JUROR, ATTORNEY SAYS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of the state financial crimes case last year, South Carolina prosecutor Creighton Waters said that in the &quot;many instances&quot; of people who trusted Murdaugh and sought his legal help, there were &quot;significant funds that Mr. Murdaugh paid to those individuals, but that was how the scheme usually worked. It was a sleight of hand.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murdaugh was initially charged with about 100 financial crimes totaling about $10 million in both the state and federal cases, but that number was lessened to 22 counts as part of his respective plea deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/alex-murdaugh-shell-man-financial-betrayal-gloria-satterfield-sister-tells-interviewer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ALEX MURDAUGH &apos;A SHELL OF A MAN&apos; FOR FINANCIAL BETRAYAL, GLORIA SATTERFIELD SISTER TELLS INTERVIEWER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being convicted in 2022 for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/true-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;killing his wife and son&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Murdaugh appeared back in court in January for a hearing focused on allegations of jury tampering against Colleton County Court Clerk Becky Hill, who announced in March she will not be seeking re-election for the position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murdaugh&apos;s attorneys argued that the allegations warranted a new murder trial for the former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/south-carolina&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;South Carolina legal scion.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Justice Jean Toal ultimately decided after hearing from jurors who presided over Murdaugh&apos;s trial that the allegations against Hill were not enough to grant the defendant a new trial in the murder case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Kennedy Hayes contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A secretive Russian could be linked to mysterious attacks on Americans overseas despite a government report that found it “very unlikely&amp;quot; a foreign adversary is involved.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A special &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Russian intelligence unit&lt;/a&gt; could be behind a series of attacks that have left dozens of U.S. officials serving overseas with mysterious illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian intelligence unit 29155, a highly secretive military unit under the direct control of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;, has potential links to the mysterious cases of &quot;Havana Syndrome&quot; that have stricken more than 100 Americans since 2016, according to a report from CBS’ &quot;60 Minutes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report comes after a 2023 government report on the mysterious illnesses concluded it is &quot;very unlikely&quot; that a foreign adversary is responsible, despite over 100 Americans having symptoms scientists have said could be caused by a beam of microwaves or acoustic sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many of the victims are skeptical of the report, expressing frustration that the U.S. government’s public position has been to downplay potential attacks on Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/florida-car-chase-2020-linked-havana-syndrome-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLORIDA CAR CHASE IN 2020 MAY BE LINKED TO HAVANA SYNDROME: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those doubts are shared by Greg Edgreen, a former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/army&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Army lieutenant colonel&lt;/a&gt; who was the lead Pentagon investigator into what are officially known as &quot;anomalous health incidents,&quot; telling &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that the bar for proving a foreign country’s involvement is set too high and that evidence has consistently pointed to Russian involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unfortunately, I can&apos;t get into specifics, based on the classification,&quot; Edgreen told &quot;60 Minutes.&quot; &quot;But I can tell you, at a very early stage, I started to focus on Moscow.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential attacks have targeted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;White House staff&lt;/a&gt;, CIA officers, FBI agents, military officers and family members, according to the report, with many of those suffering from the mysterious illnesses believing that they were targeted by a secret weapon capable of firing high-energy beams of microwaves or ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Edgreen, the officials who were targeted were top performers and doing work that was focused on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And consistently there was a Russia nexus,&quot; Edgreen said. &quot;There was some angle where they had worked against Russia, focused on Russia, and done extremely well.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/havana-syndrome-not-likely-caused-foreign-adversary-intelligence-community-finds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&apos;HAVANA SYNDROME&apos; NOT LIKELY CAUSED BY FOREIGN ADVERSARY, INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY FINDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Zaid, an attorney representing more than two dozen clients who suffer from symptoms of Havana Syndrome, agreed with Edgreen, telling &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that his clients include members of the CIA, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/state-department&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt; and FBI with a common thread in doing work related to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The one thread that I know of with the FBI personnel that is common among most, if not all, of my clients other than the family members connected to the employee, was they were all doing something relating to Russia,&quot; Zaid told &quot;60 Minutes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christo Grozev, a journalist for The Insider who worked on the investigative report with &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; believes Russian intelligence unit 29155 is involved in the potential attacks. Russian documents uncovered by Grozev show a link between 29155 and a &quot;directed energy weapon,&quot; with one document revealing an award that was given to a 29155 officer for work on &quot;potential capabilities of non-lethal acoustic weapons.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s the closest to a receipt you can have for this,&quot; Grozev told &quot;60 Minutes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also uncovered evidence that 29155 was present in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tbilisi, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; when multiple Americans reported potential incidents of attacks there, with sources telling the outlet of an investigation into a Russian named Albert Averyanov, whose name appeared on travel manifests and phone records alongside known members of 29155. The report also noted that Averyanov is the son of the unit’s commander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the Averyanov calls was intercepted, according to the report, and featured a man asking in Russian: &quot;Is it supposed to have blinking green lights?&quot; and &quot;Should I leave it on all night?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dod-still-probing-causes-havana-syndrome-intelligence-officials-say-no-adversary-linked-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOD STILL PROBING CAUSES OF ‘HAVANA SYNDROME’ AFTER INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS SAY NO ADVERSARY LINKED: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incidents of potential attacks on Americans in the country began a day after the call, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebekah Koffler, a strategic military intelligence analyst, former senior official at the Defense Intelligence Agency and author of &quot;Putin’s Playbook,&quot; told Fox News Digital that it is &quot;highly likely&quot; that Russia is behind the cases of Havana Syndrome attacks, arguing that the country has the &quot;capability, doctrine and intent to use nonlethal weapons against U.S. personnel and physical assets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;During the Cold War, Russia’s predecessor, the Soviet Union, routinely used nonlethal weapons against American government personnel,&quot; Koffler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koffler said she disagrees with the 2023 government report that concluded it was unlikely a foreign adversary was behind the potential attacks, arguing that the cases have the trademarks of operations that would typically only be carried out by 29155.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Only President Putin can authorize such intelligence operations, which are called ‘active measures’ or ‘special tasks.’ Such covert operations are normally executed by the GRU’s VCh (Voinskaya Chast’) 29155,&quot; Koffler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/havana-syndrome-foreign-adversaries-microwave-weapons-capabilities-explained-physicist&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HAVANA SYNDROME: FOREIGN ADVERSARIES&apos; MICROWAVE WEAPONS CAPABILITIES EXPLAINED BY PHYSICIST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a Russian presidential spokesperson issued a statement denying that the country was involved in the mysterious cases, calling such an accusation &quot;unfounded.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawyer representing dozens of clients, who holds a security clearance, also doubts the government assessment, telling &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that there could be some sort of &quot;cover up&quot; at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is, in my view, without a doubt, evidence of a cover up. Now, some of that cover up is not necessarily that, &apos;Oh, we found a weapon,&apos;&quot; Zaid said. &quot;What I&apos;ve seen more so is, &apos;We see lines of inquiry that would take us potentially to answers we don&apos;t want to have to deal with, so we&apos;re not going to explore any of those avenues.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report, a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the administration had ordered relevant departments to &quot;prioritize investigations into the cause&quot; of Havana Syndrome and to ensure that government employees and their families receive &quot;timely access to medical care.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Biden-Harris administration continues to emphasize the importance of prioritizing efforts to comprehensively examine the effects and potential causes of AHIs,&quot; the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/fbi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;FBI spokesperson&lt;/a&gt; told &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that the incidents are a &quot;top priority for the FBI.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will continue to work alongside our partners in the intelligence community as part of the interagency effort to determine how we can best protect our personnel,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;The FBI takes all U.S. government personnel who report symptoms seriously.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>New York Post editorial board scolded rival paper The New York Times after the Gray Lady failed to cover comments by the widow of slain NYPD Officer Jonathan Diller.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The New York Post shamed rival paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/the-new-york-times&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday after the Gray Lady failed to cover pointed comments by Stephanie Diller, the widow of slain New York Police Department Officer Jonathan Diller. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Diller received a standing ovation when she approached the lectern to deliver her remarks at her husband’s funeral on Saturday before demanding change by asking, &quot;How many more police officers and how many more families have to make the ultimate sacrifice before we start protecting them?&quot; She also put a spotlight on other recent police officers who were killed on the job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Post’s editorial board &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2024/03/31/opinion/the-new-york-times-disgraceful-deceitful-report-on-detective-dillers-funeral/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;published a piece&lt;/a&gt; headlined, &quot;The New York Times’ disgraceful, deceitful ‘report’ on Detective Diller’s funeral,&quot; which said the remarks &quot;somehow turned out to be news not fit to print for the New York Times.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/rfk-jr-declares-ny-times-instrument-democratic-party-tense-interview&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RFK JR. DECLARES NY TIMES AN &apos;INSTRUMENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY&apos; DURING TENSE INTERVIEW WITH PAPER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Her words made the front page of The Post and even the hyperleft Daily News; nebbishy Newsday at least put the funeral on Page One,&quot; the Post’s editorial board wrote. &quot;Yet the Times stuck its report on page A21, without even a ‘tracer’ on the front page. (The one local story that got that privilege was about… new city trash containers.) The article quoted the widow’s eulogy, but not her most newsworthy appeal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The editorial board continued: &quot;Not even in the online version, with no space limit at all, though it ran 1,100-plus words. But the Times did find room for the ever-important ‘Republicans pounce’ angle: nearly 300 words on how ‘Some people — particularly Republicans — have seized on the killing as emblematic of what they consider the lax laws and public safety policies promoted by New York Democrats,’ when, the article ‘explained,’ major crime reports in the city are down 2% this year over last.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/wife-slain-nypd-officer-jonathan-diller-delivers-emotional-eulogy-thousands-attend-funeral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WIFE OF SLAIN NYPD OFFICER JONATHAN DILLER DELIVERS EMOTIONAL EULOGY AS THOUSANDS ATTEND FUNERAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Post’s editorial board wrote that the Times &quot;offered a masterclass in how to present disingenuous spin in the guise of honest reporting&quot; and declared its motto has become &quot;Only the news that supports our agenda.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times did not respond to a request for comment by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/nypd-jonathan-diller-shooting-suspect-guy-rivera-charged-murder-attempted-murder-attack-officers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NYPD JONATHAN DILLER SHOOTING: SUSPECT GUY RIVERA CHARGED WITH MURDER, ATTEMPTED MURDER IN ATTACK ON OFFICERS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/jonathan-diller-shooting-nypd-sergeants-union-tells-anti-police-democrats-stay-away-funeral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Diller was fatally shot&lt;/a&gt; last week during a traffic stop in Queens after a man with 21 prior arrests allegedly shot him in the stomach as Diller was trying to make the suspect — Guy Rivera, 34 — exit the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivera reportedly opened fire on Diller and his partner at about 5:45 p.m. The officers had approached the vehicle because it had been illegally parked at a bus stop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another man who was in the vehicle at the time of Diller&apos;s death, Lindy Jones, was also charged following the death, including for criminal possession of a weapon and defacing a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital’s Timothy Nerozzi contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Baylor&apos;s Nicki Collen pushes back on WaPo profile&apos;s shot at women&apos;s basketball program: &apos;Nothing is withering&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Baylor women&amp;apos;s basketball coach Nicki Collen took issue with the shot the program took in a Washington Post profile on LSU coach Kim Mulkey.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/baylor-bears&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Baylor Bears women’s basketball&lt;/a&gt; coach Nicki Collen had a different take on The Washington Post’s profile of LSU’s Kim Mulkey after a close loss to USC in the Sweet 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lsus-kim-mulkey-shrugs-off-piece-released-ahead-of-sweet-16-profiling-rifts-during-career-havent-read-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;story described&lt;/a&gt; Baylor as &quot;no longer among the sport’s upper tier, another structure abandoned and left to wither&quot; in the wake of Mulkey’s departure. Collen took over for Mulkey and has made the tournament in each of her first three seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m not afraid to say I was really, really offended by the article that came out,&quot; Collen said. &quot;I didn’t read any of it. I didn’t read any of it. Don’t know what happened, but nothing’s withering in Waco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nothing is withering in Waco. And we’re going to do it our way, and it’s going to be just as good. But nothing is withering, and we are not not a first-tier team, and you can’t say we are. You can’t get to the Sweet 16 and take a No. 1 seed down to the wire in a one-possession game and say anything is withering in Waco.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/iowa-lsu-meet-national-championship-rematch-2023s-trash-talking-mind&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IOWA, LSU MEET IN NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP REMATCH WITH 2023&apos;S TRASH-TALKING ON THE MIND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth, Collen only wrapped up her third season with the Bears. The Sweet 16 matchup against No. 1-seeded USC was the furthest the team has gotten under Collen. But Mulkey, in her first three seasons, only made it as far as the second round once. She also had the team in the WNIT in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There’s a lot blooming, I’m not going to say withering,&quot; Collen added. &quot;There’s some stuff blooming in Waco. If he wants to come do an article and come to Waco and write about it next year, he’s welcome.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collen was the head coach of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/wnba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Atlanta Dream&lt;/a&gt; from 2018 to 2020. She was named the 2018 WNBA Coach of the Year in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that, she served as an assistant with the Connecticut Sun and with several collegiate programs. She played college ball at Purdue and Marquette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>China’s gambling hub of Macao bids farewell to horse racing tradition after more than 40 years</title>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After more than 40 years, Macao’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/horse-racing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;horse racing&lt;/a&gt; track hosted its final races on Saturday, bringing an end to the sport in the city famous for its massive casinos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, the city’s government said it would terminate its contract with the Macao Jockey Club in April. The decision came at the request of the Macao Horse Race Company, which cited operational challenges as part of the reasons for the closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, gamblers congregated in the half-full stands and placed their final bets. Some tourists also visited the track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/horse-racing-oversight-board-reports-equine-fatality-rate-1-23-per-1000-tracks-regulates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORSE RACING OVERSIGHT BOARD REPORTS EQUINE FATALITY RATE OF 1.23 PER 1,000 AT TRACKS IT REGULATES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mai Wan-zun, a student from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;mainland China&lt;/a&gt; in Macao, said she wanted to get a taste of the atmosphere. &quot;We could come to see horse racing here in Macao, but not in mainland China,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helena Chong, a Macao resident, decided to visit the race course for the first and last time to see what it&apos;s all about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s a pity to see the end of all this gambling and entertainment,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horse racing in the former Portuguese colony has struggled with economic challenges in recent years and has yet to rebound from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its jockey club had accumulated operating losses of over $311 million, the Macau News Agency earlier reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the termination arrangement, the horse racing firm had pledged to arrange for transportation of owners’ horses to other locations by March 2025, and handle the company’s employees according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the law&lt;/a&gt;, the government said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In neighboring Hong Kong, horse-racing remains popular and profitable. Its jockey club runs various gambling activities and is the city’s major donor of many charity works.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
