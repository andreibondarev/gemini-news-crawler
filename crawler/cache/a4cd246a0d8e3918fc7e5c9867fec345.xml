                    <description>Hunter Biden was seen Monday at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll alongside the president as House Republicans continue mulling possible criminal referrals for them.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/hunter-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hunter Biden&lt;/a&gt; was spotted attending Monday&apos;s White House Easter Egg Roll alongside his father, President Biden, as House Republicans reportedly mull potential criminal referrals against them to the Department of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunter arrived at the White House on Sunday evening with his wife, Melissa Cohen, and their son, Beau, after spending the Easter weekend at Camp David with the president and First Lady &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/b/jill-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jill Biden&lt;/a&gt;. The five were photographed exiting Marine One at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family getaway came as Republicans on the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees are jointly investigating alleged Biden family corruption as part of an impeachment inquiry into the president, and are reportedly floating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;possible criminal referrals&lt;/a&gt; in lieu of an impeachment vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/swing-state-house-hopeful-changes-tune-after-scrubbing-violent-crime-defenses-law-firm-website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SWING STATE HOUSE HOPEFUL CHANGES TUNE AFTER SCRUBBING VIOLENT CRIME DEFENSES FROM LAW FIRM WEBSITE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports that Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., was considering criminal referrals followed the two committees&apos; joint hearing last week that included testimony from multiple former business associates of Hunter who testified to the extent of Biden&apos;s involvement in his son&apos;s business dealings, which the White House has denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Comer hasn&apos;t specified who these criminal referrals would target, they could provide a way for Republicans to please those anxious for the Biden family to face some sort of consequences from the alleged influence-peddling scheme as the party looks unlikely to have the votes to successfully impeach the president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-jersey-democrat-facing-pressure-resign-mocking-easter-online-drag-abortion-references&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NEW JERSEY DEMOCRAT FACING PRESSURE TO RESIGN AFTER MOCKING EASTER ONLINE WITH DRAG, ABORTION REFERENCES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunter&apos;s appearance at the White House capped a multi-day schedule that included his attendance at his dad&apos;s swanky, but controversial, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-mingles-obama-clinton-ritzy-nyc-fundraiser-same-day-fallen-cop-is-mourned-just-40-miles-away&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York City fundraiser&lt;/a&gt; held last Thursday, the same day as the wake of an NYPD officer killed in the line of duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the White House faced flak for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-omits-hunter-biden-visitor-logs-despite-obama-admin-disclosing-visits&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;omitting Hunter&apos;s visits&lt;/a&gt; and extended stays from its visitor logs from the beginning of the Biden administration through Feb. 2023 despite claiming it was &quot;the most transparent administration in American history.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many of the events attended by Hunter were ceremonial and a tradition at the White House, Fox News Digital previously reported how Hunter sought to use such events for his personal financial gain during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/barack-obama&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Obama administration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The death of a student &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/college&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;on Bucknell University&apos;s campus&lt;/a&gt; Saturday was unrelated to what is being described as an active shooter &quot;hoax&quot; on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is with a heavy heart that I share the news of the death of a Bucknell student on campus today. Together we mourn the passing of Christian Samay ’24. This is an unspeakable loss for the Bucknell community, and our hearts go out to Christian’s family and friends,&quot; University President John C. Bravman said in a Saturday statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bravman added that Samay&apos;s death was unrelated to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;an active shooter alert&lt;/a&gt; and lockdown on campus Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[T]he circumstances are not suspicious,&quot; Bravman said. &quot;We appreciate your support and respect for the privacy of all involved.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/nc-state-alumni-report-150-cancer-cases-possibly-stemming-contaminants-shut-down-campus-building&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NC STATE ALUMNI REPORT 150+ CANCER CASES POSSIBLY STEMMING FROM CONTAMINANTS IN SHUT-DOWN CAMPUS BUILDING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School spokesperson Mike Ferlazzo told Fox News Digital that the active shooter report &quot;was determined to be a hoax coordinated out of Virginia, according to an investigation by State Police.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police responded to the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house on the 70th block of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/pennsylvania&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;University Avenue in Lewisburg,&lt;/a&gt; officials told WBRE/WYOU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university canceled classes Monday and offered counseling resources for students seeking support over the weekend in the wake of Samay&apos;s death. Students can access a Crisis Text Line any time by texting HOME to 741741.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/university-maryland-hazing-allegedly-included-being-burned-cigarettes-lying-nails-docs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND HAZING ALLEGEDLY INCLUDED BEING BURNED WITH CIGARETTES, LYING ON NAILS: DOCS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I call upon all Bucknellians to support each other in this difficult time, and to keep Christian’s family in your prayers,&quot; Bravman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samay&apos;s LinkedIn profile states that he was studying political science at Bucknell and participated in several investment banking internships — the latest being at M&amp;amp;T Bank in Baltimore last summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bucknell has not released the cause of Samay&apos;s death at this time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>GOP state AGs press Supreme Court to take up Hawaii climate change case they say is &apos;grave threat&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>20 Republican state attorneys general are asking the Supreme Court to intervene in a climate change case they say could have &amp;quot;grave&amp;quot; consequences on American energy production.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST ON FOX&lt;/strong&gt; – A group of nearly two-dozen Republican attorneys general is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/supreme-court&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;asking the Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; to intervene in a climate change liability case out of Hawaii they say could have &quot;grave&quot; consequences on American energy production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, a coalition of major oil companies asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/big-oil-companies-ask-supreme-court-intervene-high-stakes-climate-case&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;city of Honolulu’s lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; that accused the companies of deceiving the public about their role in causing global warming, which could in turn cost the companies billions in damages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, 20 states on Monday filed an amicus brief asking the high court to review the case — arguing that the lawsuit, and several others like it percolating in the lower courts, is &quot;an affront to the equal sovereignty&quot; of their states and an attempt by one state to use its own laws to impose its energy policies nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The grave threat these suits pose to equal sovereignty and our Nation’s energy infrastructure are reason enough for this Court to grant review,&quot; the filing states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/left-wing-groups-increasingly-using-courts-push-green-new-deal-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CONSUMER GROUP REVEALS LEFT-WING GROUPS INCREASINGLY USING COURTS TO PUSH GREEN NEW DEAL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the city of Honolulu sued several major fossil fuel companies, including Exxon and Chevron, claiming the companies’ products cause greenhouse gas emissions and global warming without warning consumers about the risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city employed a series of state laws like public nuisance and trespass measures and said the companies should pay billions to the state to abate the effects of climate change like weather events, sea level rise, heat waves, flooding, and global warming generally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The energy companies appealed to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/hawaii&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hawaii Supreme Court,&lt;/a&gt; arguing federal law prevents individual states from effectively shaping energy policies for all states, but that court disagreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The time for this Court’s intervention is now,&quot; the AGs wrote in their brief, adding that &quot;reducing the sale and use of traditional energy &lt;i&gt;everywhere &lt;/i&gt;is not among a State’s constitutional powers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say the case presents a &quot;unique opportunity&quot; because Hawaii courts granted a rare appeal option and stayed most of the discovery in the case while parties went through the appeals process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Court should act before state courts issue preliminary relief that could trigger a national emergency or fashion a patchwork of new taxes on the Nation’s energy system that would make life harder for every American,&quot; the AGs wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Fox News Digital, Attorney General Marshall said the lawsuit is &quot;an effort by environmentalists to control energy policy in this country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They&apos;re attempting to do it through friendly forums, in this case, state court in Hawaii. And the people of Alabama absolutely object to a state court judge in Hawaii ultimately determining how it is that we deal with the fossil fuel industry here in this country,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/billionaire-fueled-rockefeller-fund-coordinated-climate-lawsuits-dem-state-ag-internal-documents&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BILLIONAIRE-FUELED ROCKEFELLER FUND COORDINATED CLIMATE LAWSUITS WITH DEM STATE AG: INTERNAL DOCUMENTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What we see here is the use of a damages verdict to either change the behavior of fossil fuel companies, or exponentially increase the cost of energy to the citizens of the United States,&quot; Marshall explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attorneys general argue – and cite America’s rich state-sovereignty precedent – that federal common law already says disputes relating to cross-border pollution ought to be decided by federal courts, not states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also cite the Clean Air Act, which they argue still lets states have certain powers to regulate emissions notwithstanding federal intervention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Clean Air Act recognizes &quot;the primary responsibility&quot; of states to prevent and control &quot;air pollution … at its source.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The statutory scheme exemplifies cooperative federalism, permitting States to implement their own regulations consistent with a federal baseline,&quot; the AGs write in their brief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a result, our federal system allows States to pursue divergent policies with respect to energy production and environmental protection.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You don&apos;t want to allow states like Hawaii or California to define energy policy for the entire country. But they&apos;re using the threat of a massive jury verdict, to be able to bankrupt the fossil fuel industry,&quot; Marshall told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And that&apos;s not good for the citizens of Alabama. It&apos;s not good for providing affordable energy and available energy to the people of this country,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dark-money-fueled-law-firm-joins-massachusetts-climate-suit-against-big-oil&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DARK MONEY-FUELED LAW FIRM JOINS MASSACHUSETTS CLIMATE SUIT AGAINST BIG OIL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Although a case nestled in the state of Hawaii, a long way from us here in Alabama, it&apos;s critically important for us to be engaged. And in fact, critically important for the Supreme Court, ultimately to help decide this issue,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AGs said in the brief that the &quot;theory used against energy companies can be expanded to allow targeting of &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; cross-border activity that purportedly ‘exacerbate[s] the impacts of climate change.’&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example they point to happened just a few weeks ago, when the State of New York sued &quot;the world’s largest producer of beef products, for misleading the public about its environmental impact.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beef producer’s stated commitment to reach &quot;Net Zero by 2040&quot; is allegedly misleading because the company &quot;plans to grow global demand for its product,&quot; rather than &quot;reduce production of and demand for&quot; it. The company’s emissions &quot;of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and … supply chain practices&quot; purportedly &quot;contribut[e] to climate change harms.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;New York’s complaint alleges that ‘the world’s top five meat and dairy corporations combined are responsible for more annual greenhouse gas emissions than ExxonMobil, Shell, or BP, individually.’  Surely in some State’s view, those companies too (and countless others) have ‘exacerbated the impacts of climate change,’&quot; the AG’s brief states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But the States, upon entering the Union, gave up the right to use their laws for this sort of interstate conflict. The Court should grant review here before any further damage is done to our national economy and our federal scheme,&quot; it concludes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of Honolulu is expected to file its response on May 1, with a final brief scheduled to be May 15. A decision from the Supreme Court on whether they will review the case could come in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the City and County of Honolulu for a response to the amicus brief.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Atlantic City mayor says home was searched over &apos;private family issue,&apos; dismissing corruption whisperings</title>
                    
                    <description>Democratic Mayor Marty Small of Atlantic City, New Jersey, said Monday that five search warrants were executed at his home over a personal matter, denying a criminal investigation.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-jersey-shore-atlantic-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Atlantic City&lt;/a&gt; Mayor Marty Small said Monday that a search of his home last week by prosecutors involved &quot;a private family issue,&quot; not a crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democratic mayor held a news conference at City Hall to respond to the execution last Thursday of five search warrants by the Atlantic County Prosecutor&apos;s Office naming the mayor and his wife, LaQuetta Small, the city&apos;s superintendent of schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small said he and his wife have been interacting with state child welfare authorities and have nothing to hide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-atlantic-city-politico-charged-absentee-ballot-fraud-case&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATLANTIC CITY POLITICO CHARGED IN ABSENTEE BALLOT FRAUD CASE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re going through family therapy, and that&apos;s what this should be, a family matter,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small&apos;s wife and two children attended the news conference with him but did not speak, and left before it was completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Butkowski, a spokesman for the state Division of Child Protection and Permanency, said Monday it cannot publicly discuss its cases to protect the privacy of those involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After officers from the county prosecutor&apos;s office searched the Smalls&apos; home and vehicles, they left with two cellphones and between four to six laptops, said Small&apos;s attorney, Edwin Jacobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance/investigations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;entire investigation&lt;/a&gt; arose from nothing more than a personal and emotional family matter,&quot; Jacobs said. &quot;Mayor Small and his wife LaQuetta indeed have high public profiles, deservedly so. Like any family, the Small family has challenges in raising children, and they do not merit investigation or oversight by the county prosecutor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small said 20 heavily armed officers from the prosecutor&apos;s office converged on his home a few blocks from the city&apos;s casinos, saying some carried rifles and battering rams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No charges were announced against either of the Smalls after the raid or in subsequent days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor&apos;s office issued a statement responding to Small&apos;s news conference, saying its officers followed all policies and protocols, acted professionally, and treated the Smalls with respect, but declining to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The search of the mayor&apos;s home came hours after the prosecutor&apos;s office announced it had charged the principal of Atlantic City High School with failing to report a case of suspected child abuse, as required by law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor’s office charged Constance Days-Chapman on Thursday with official misconduct, hindering apprehension of another, obstruction of justice, and failure to report child abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency said in a news release that on Jan. 22, a juvenile student at the high school informed a school staff member that the student had been emotionally and physically abused by the student’s parents, and that the student had previously disclosed this abuse to Days-Chapman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days-Chapman told the staff member she would report the matter to state child welfare officials, but never did so, according to the prosecutor’s office. Instead, Days-Chapman met with the juvenile’s parents at the parents’ house and informed them that the juvenile disclosed to school staff that the juvenile was being abused by them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither the student nor the parents were identified in the news release. Days-Chapman’s office did not respond to telephone messages left with her office Thursday and Monday seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days-Chapman also is the president of the city’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/democrats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Democratic Committee&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2021 headed up Marty Small’s mayoral reelection campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked directly if the student referenced in the charges brought against Days-Chapman is the Smalls&apos; daughter, Jacobs said he would not &quot;respond to any specific factual allegations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re not here to try a case that has not been brought,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Small defended the principal, referring to her by her nickname and noting that she is such a close friend that she is practically a member of his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We stand with Mandy and Mandy stands with us,&quot; Small said. &quot;She has done nothing wrong. We have done nothing wrong.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small referred to Atlantic City&apos;s long history of political corruption, which was immortalized in the hit TV series &quot;Boardwalk Empire.&quot; Small himself took office after his predecessor admitted stealing $87,000 from a youth basketball program he founded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Those of you who want to think this is past Atlantic City business as usual — when it&apos;s a raid, it&apos;s involving corruption — this ain&apos;t that,&quot; he said. &quot;My wife and I control over half a billion dollars of taxpayer money, and we&apos;re doing a damn good job at it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Biden says he &apos;didn&apos;t do that&apos; when asked about Easter being &apos;Trans Visibility Day,&apos; despite proclamation</title>
                    
                    <description>President Biden declined responsibility when asked about his proclamation declaring March 31, the same day as Easter this year, as Transgender Day Of Visibility.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;President Biden said Monday that he &quot;didn&apos;t do that&quot; when asked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bidens-transgender-day-visibility-proclamation-easter-thumb-face-christians&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;his official White House proclamation&lt;/a&gt; declaring March 31, the same day as Easter this year, as Transgender Day Of Visibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an exchange with reporters at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-doubles-down-inclusiveness-message-backlash-transgender-day-visibility-easter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden declined responsibility for the proclamation&lt;/a&gt; when asked about House Speaker Mike Johnson&apos;s, R-La., criticism of the action. Over the weekend, Johnson wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that the White House &quot;betrayed the central tenet of Easter,&quot; adding that the proclamation was &quot;outrageous and abhorrent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He’s thoroughly uninformed,&quot; Biden remarked when asked about Johnson&apos;s comments. &quot;I didn’t do that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for the White House downplayed the president&apos;s comments, noting that he didn&apos;t choose March 31 as the date for Transgender Day of Visibility. Since 2021, when Biden took office, the White House has issued the same proclamation on March 31 every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-skewered-worlds-worst-catholic-cheapens-irish-catholic-identity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN SKEWERED AS &apos;WORLD’S WORST CATHOLIC&apos; WHO CHEAPENS IRISH AND CATHOLIC IDENTITY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;President Biden is right. He did nothing in conflict with the ‘tenets’ of Easter, which he celebrated yesterday. Nor did he choose the date of March 31 for Transgender Day of Visibility, which has been set since 2009,&quot; White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/magics-jonathan-isaac-criticizes-white-house-transgender-visibility-day&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Transgender Day of Visibility&lt;/a&gt; proclamation, the White House simultaneously issued a flurry of other proclamations, including Cesar Chavez Day, National Donate Life Month, National Cancer Prevention and Early Detection Month, Arab American Heritage Month and Care Workers Recognition Month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-slammed-social-media-announcing-transgender-day-visibility-easter-sunday&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN SLAMMED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER ANNOUNCING TRANSGENDER DAY OF VISIBILITY ON EASTER SUNDAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the timing of the Transgender Day of Visibility proclamation generated widespread outrage among Christians, who characterized its timing with Easter as disrespectful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What a slap in the face to all Christians in America…&quot; conservative commentator Benny Johnson said in a social media post Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a direct assault on Christianity. It’s evident the left is determined to undermine our religion and traditions,&quot; added Rep. Diana Harshbarger, R-Tenn. &quot;This isn’t just blatant disregard, it’s intentional.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden has previously come under fire for his stance on LGBTQ+ and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/abortion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;abortion issues&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, given his own position as a &quot;devout Catholic&quot; who regularly attends church. The White House also used the same terminology when addressing Biden&apos;s pro-choice stance on abortion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent poll from Pew Research found that just 13% of Americans think of Biden as &quot;very religious,&quot; while 41% say he is &quot;somewhat religious&quot; and another 44% say he is &quot;not at all&quot; or &quot;not too religious.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Haley Chi-Sing and Anders Hagstrom contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to religious milestones, the first Holy Communion is an important one in some Christian traditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It usually happens when a child is around eight years old and in the springtime due to the Easter holiday, which celebrates the resurrection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/christianity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a significant event in faith, marking a child&apos;s reception of the Eucharist for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re choosing a gift for a child celebrating his or her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/faith&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;first Holy Communion,&lt;/a&gt; consider the suggestions below that could be meaningful and relevant to the spiritual journey — all are available to purchase on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/bible-quiz-how-much-know-bible-test&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;A Bible&lt;/a&gt; made specially for children receiving their first Communion is a gift that may be used for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for editions with colorful illustrations, easy-to-understand language and sections dedicated to the sacraments, like this one from Amazon, which allows children to share memories of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/spring-cleaning-sustainable-products&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPRING CLEAN YOUR HOME WITH THESE 10 SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider a decorative wall cross to hang above the child&apos;s bedroom doorway or a keepsake box adorned with a cross design — such as this Cherished Moments box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It allows you to personalize it with the child&apos;s name and date of his or her Holy Communion at no extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/items-help-start-new-hobbies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 AMAZON ITEMS THAT CAN HELP YOU START NEW HOBBIES THIS YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prayer book or journal filled with prayers, devotions and reflections appropriate for children is a gift he or she may cherish throughout their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/religion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;religious journey.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/spring-2024-backyard-game-plants-more-gifts-grab-amazon-now&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPRING 2024: A BACKYARD GAME, PLANTS AND MORE GIFTS TO GRAB ON AMAZON NOW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for books tailored to their age group and featuring prayers for various occasions and intentions, like this one for under $10 on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A delicate cross necklace is a practical gift that allows children to wear their faith on their chest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opt for durable materials like sterling silver or gold-plated options, and ensure the chain length is suitable for a child&apos;s age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This splurge item from Lucchetta is 14K gold, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/italy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;made in Italy&lt;/a&gt; and comes with a 10K box chain.

                    <description>Indonesia&amp;apos;s President-elect Prabowo Subianto, who will succeed Joko Widodo later this year, met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday to continue Indonesia&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;friendly policy&amp;apos; toward China.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (AP) — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/controversial-indonesian-defense-minister-wins-presidential-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Indonesian President-elect Prabowo Subianto&lt;/a&gt; pledged to continue his country’s friendly policy toward China as he met Monday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subianto, who will succeed Joko Widodo in October, chose Beijing for his first official visit after his February election victory in a bid to emphasize the countries’ robust ties amid rising tensions in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/indonesias-military-arrests-13-elite-soldiers-accused-involvement-torture-video&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INDONESIA&apos;S MILITARY ARRESTS 13 ELITE SOLDIERS WHO ARE ACCUSED OF INVOLVEMENT IN A TORTURE VIDEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will follow up his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-warned-as-philippine-president-proposes-countermeasures-against-beijings-aggression&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; trip with a visit to Japan, suggesting that Indonesia will continue to pursue a middle road between Beijing and the United States’ allies in the region, such as Japan and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subianto described &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chinese-migrants-make-multi-country-trek-us-southern-border-i-just-want-make-money&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; as Indonesia&apos;s &quot;strong cooperative partner,&quot; according to a readout of his meeting with Xi, released by the official Xinhua news agency. The president-elect expressed his willingness to continue Widodo’s &quot;friendly policy&quot; toward Beijing and promote cooperation in fields such as the economy, trade and poverty alleviation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is set to also meet with Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Defense Minister Dong Jun before departing on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China became Indonesia’s largest trading partner during Widodo’s decade in office, with Beijing investing billions in major infrastructure projects such as the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, which opened last October, and Cirata, Southeast Asia’s largest floating solar power project, on a reservoir in West Java, 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the capital Jakarta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xi said China wanted to continue to build strong ties with Indonesia and referred to the Jakarta-Bandung railway as a &quot;golden&quot; example of the countries’ cooperation, according to Xinhua.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xi added China was willing to deepen maritime cooperation with Indonesia and provide it with support in poverty reduction and alleviation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia has maintained a relatively neutral stance amid rising tensions between China and the Philippines over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The Philippines has boosted security ties with Washington since President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took office in 2022, shifting back from the more China-friendly policy of his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China and the Philippines have been engaging in repeated high-seas confrontations since last year, sparking fears of a larger conflict that could put China and the U.S. on a collision course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has warned repeatedly that it’s obligated to defend the Philippines — its oldest treaty ally in Asia — if Filipino forces, ships or aircraft come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei have overlapping claims in the resource-rich and busy waterway. Beijing has refused to recognize a 2016 international arbitration ruling that invalidated its expansive claims on historical grounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Marvel actor and television star Michael Stuhlbarg was assaulted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; by a homeless man, according to a new report by People magazine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday evening, a 55-year-old male was walking around East 90th and East Drive in Manhattan near Central Park when he was struck in the back of his head with a rock by Xavier Israel, a 27-year-old homeless man, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/snl-alum-chris-redd-attacked-outside-comedy-club-new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;DPCI spokesperson&lt;/a&gt; told Fox News Digital. The incident took place around 7:45 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brief chase ensued with Stuhlbarg following Israel. DCPI is not aware of any ‘verbal exchange’ between the men. Police, who were responding to a 911 call, arrested Israel shortly after. It&apos;s unclear who called law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/marvel-slates-eternals-dr-strange-sequel-natalie-portman-as-lady-thor-blade-reboot-for-phase-four&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARVEL SLATES &apos;ETERNALS,&apos; &apos;DR.

A representative for Stuhlbarg did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital&apos;s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel was charged with assault in the second degree and was taken to central booking. Police say this is not Israel&apos;s first offense. He was arrested on two separate occasions in Jan. 2022 for assault and robbery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuhlbarg, a veteran character actor, has played a litany of famous figures, including politician George H.

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — American and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-pressure-netanyahu-thousands-gather-largest-protest-war-began&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; officials were holding virtual talks Monday to discuss the potential expansion of Israel&apos;s war against Hamas to the southern Gaza city of Rafah, a move the U.S. opposes on humanitarian grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officials met by secure video conference, a week after planned in-person talks were nixed by Israeli &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-undergo-hernia-surgery-full-anesthesia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a&gt; when the U.S. didn&apos;t veto a U.N. resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter, said the U.S. anticipates that &quot;expert teams&quot; will follow up on the talks in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-ahead-surgery-vows-israel-invade-rafah-despite-pressure-ramadan-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NETANYAHU, AHEAD OF SURGERY, VOWS ISRAEL WILL INVADE RAFAH, DESPITE PRESSURE FROM RAMADAN, US&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden and his administration have publicly and privately urged Israel for months to refrain from a large-scale incursion into Rafah — where more than 1.3 million civilians are estimated to have fled from other parts of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/world-health-organization-silent-hamas-use-gaza-hospital-terror-hq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; — without a credible plan to relocate and safeguard noncombatants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu has insisted that Israel must be able to enter the city as it has the rest of the territory in order to root out Hamas&apos; remaining brigades, as Israeli forces try to eradicate the group after the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential operation in the city has exposed one of the deepest rifts between Israel and its closest ally, funder and arms supplier. The U.S. has already openly said Israel must do more to allow food and other goods through its blockade of Gaza to avert famine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Jake Sullivan, Biden&apos;s national security adviser, was leading the U.S. delegation in the meeting, which was rescheduled from this coming Friday because &quot;we wanted to move very quickly on this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Businesses, environmental groups back bid to put massive hiking trail overhaul before Maine voters</title>
                    
                    <description>Over 500 entities have coalesced behind a Maine proposal to send a $30 million overhaul of the state&amp;apos;s nature trail system to the ballot box.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Maine&apos;s beloved outdoor trail network could receive millions of dollars of improvements under a proposal conservationists have asked lawmakers to put before voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state has long been a destination for hikers, cyclists, snowshoers and other outdoor adventurers, and the state has more than 14,000 miles of snowmobile trails alone. A proposal before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Maine Legislature&lt;/a&gt; would ask voters to approve $30 million in public money for the design, development and maintenance of both motorized and nonmotorized trails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-national-park-service-faces-lawsuit-plan-remove-hundreds-stray-cats-historic-tourist-spot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US NATIONAL PARK SERVICE FACES LAWSUIT OVER PLAN TO REMOVE HUNDREDS OF STRAY CATS FROM HISTORIC TOURIST SPOT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A coalition of more than 500 organizations, businesses and towns in the state has rallied behind the proposal. Members of the coalition, which includes ATV Maine, Maine Municipal Association and the Maine Youth Camping Association, said investing in the trail network is critical to boosting the state&apos;s economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In literally every corner of the state, trails are a valued resource for connecting Maine people and visitors with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/great-outdoors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;natural world&lt;/a&gt; and reaching destinations to work and play,&quot; the coalition said in a statement. It added that the trails support tens of thousands of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A committee of the Maine Legislature voted last Friday in favor of sending the proposal to voters. The next step is for the full Legislature to cast a vote. The proposal had not been scheduled for a vote as of Monday, a spokesperson for the Legislature said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal states that the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry would provide the money to municipalities and nonprofit organizations via a competitive grant process. Trail networks around the state are operated by local governments as well as private clubs and conservation organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal would appear on the statewide ballot in November if the Legislature approves it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail improvements should find broad appeal around the state, Pete Didisheim, advocacy director for the Natural Resources Council of Maine, said while testifying in favor of the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The trails &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/maine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;of Maine&lt;/a&gt; are near and dear to us all, for hiking, biking, snowmobiling, skiing, running, walking, and many other activities,&quot; Didisheim said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>New Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures monster merger movie “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire&amp;quot; exceeded box office expectations with an $80 million opening on 3,861 screens in North America.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Godzilla-King Kong combo stomped on expectations as &quot;Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire&quot; roared to an $80 million opening on 3,861 North American screens, according to Sunday studio estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monster merger from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/fox-corporation-partnering-with-disney-warner-bros-discovery-new-sports-streaming-platform&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt; and Legendary Pictures starring Rebecca Hall and Brian Tyree Henry brought the second-highest opening in what has been a robust year, falling just short of the the $81.5 million debut of &quot;Dune: Part 2.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/godzilla-x-kong-the-new-empire-titans-stars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN ‘GODZILLA X KONG: THE NEW EMPIRE,’ THE TITANS ARE THE STARS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projections had put the opening weekend of &quot;Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,&quot; which sees the monsters teaming up instead of squaring up, at closer to $50 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s a cinematic event, and we’re seeing these iconic characters doing things we’ve never seen them do before,&quot; said Mary Parent, chairman of worldwide production for Legendary. &quot;There’s big swaths of the film that don’t have any dialogue, where we put you with the characters, it’s a very mythic experience.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week&apos;s No. 1 at the box office, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ghostbusters-frozen-empire-hits-theaters-ahead-original-movies-40th-anniversary-cast-then-now&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; was second with $15.7 million for a two-week total of $73.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dune-star-josh-brolin-trashes-old-movie-wont-ever-stop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Dune: Part Two&quot;&lt;/a&gt; stayed strong in its fifth week, falling in the third spot with an $11.1 million take and a domestic total of $252.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last matchup of the two monsters from Warner Bros. and Legendary, 2021&apos;s &quot; Godzilla vs. Kong,&quot; had a much smaller opening weekend of $48.5 million, but for a film slowed by the coronavirus pandemic and released simultaneously on HBO Max, it was a serious success that signaled what was to come for the pairing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was a really big number all things considered,&quot; Parent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newer film had the second biggest opening of the studios&apos; broader MonsterVerse franchise. &quot;Godzilla&quot; brought in $93.2 million in 2014. It was the biggest earner in the nearly 70-year cinematic history of the creature that originated and spent most of its screen life in Japan. It earned more than $200 million in North America and more than $500 million globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Godzilla x Kong&quot; comes just four months after the most recent Japanese rendition, the critical favorite and Oscar winner &quot;Godzilla Minus One.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was clearly no Godzilla glut for audiences, many of whom were willing to pay extra for IMAX and other special formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These are literally two of the biggest movie stars in the world, and you have to see them on the biggest screen possible with the biggest sound possible,&quot; said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of &quot;Godzilla x Kong,&quot; &quot;Dune Part Two&quot; and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; has put the year to date 6 percent behind 2023, while it was 20 percent behind on the eve of the March 1 release of &quot;Dune.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The industry was feeling pretty glum right before ‘Dune Part 2’ opened, but they&apos;ve made up a lot of ground,&quot; said Dergarabedian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summer is full of titles that are not guaranteed megahits but could break big, including Ryan Gosling&apos;s &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; and the next installments of &quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; &quot;Mad Max,&quot; &quot;Inside Out&quot; and &quot;Deadpool.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That brings cause for optimism as the theatrical movie business seeks to hang on, though it’s highly unlikely it will surpass 2023, which saw &quot;Barbie&quot; surpass $1 billion globally with its release-date mate &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; not far behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&apos;Barbenheimer&apos;&quot; is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime event,&quot; Dergarabedian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimated ticket sales are for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &quot;Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,&quot; 80 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &quot;Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,&quot; $15.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &quot;Dune: Part Two,&quot; $11.1 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. &quot;Kung Fu Panda 4,&quot; $10.2. million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. &quot;Immaculate,&quot; $3.3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. &quot;Arthur the King,&quot; $2.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. &quot;Late Night With the Devil,&quot; $2.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. &quot;Tillu Square,&quot; $1.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. &quot;Crew,&quot; $1.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. &quot;Imaginary,&quot; $1.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A transgender woman fighting to shut down &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement &lt;/a&gt;detention centers is this year&apos;s recipient of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award — an honor bestowed by the advocacy group meant to carry on RFK&apos;s legacy and founded by his daughter, Kerry Kennedy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arely Westley, an LGBTQ+ and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/immigration-activists-liberal-senate-dems-trash-border-deal-lack-amnesty-illegals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;immigration activist &lt;/a&gt;who identifies as a &quot;trans-Latinx woman,&quot; will be the 41st recipient of the award, which was announced over the weekend. The organization said Westley will be recognized during an official ceremony in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Human Rights award &quot;honors an individual or group of individuals who stand up to oppression at grave personal risk in the nonviolent pursuit of human rights,&quot; according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Westley is the first transgender woman to receive the award, the organization confirmed to Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-expected-announce-wealthy-female-entrepreneur-vice-presidential-running-mate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ROBERT F.

Once released, RFK Human Rights claims Westley began leading &quot;multiple shutdown campaigns,&quot; calling for the closure of ICE &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;detention facilities&lt;/a&gt; that have a &quot;history of documented abuse.&quot; According to RFK Human Rights, Westley suffered &quot;egregious human rights violations&quot; and was held in solitary confinement for extra protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Westley currently serves as a campaign director at BreakOUT!, an organization that seeks to &quot;end the criminalization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning youth who are directly impacted by the criminal or juvenile justice system in New Orleans.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/virginia-county-declares-trans-visibility-day-easter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;VIRGINIA COUNTY DECLARES TRANSGENDER DAY OF VISIBILITY ON EASTER THIS YEAR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I feel honored to accept this award on behalf of my trans community, standing on the shoulders of our ancestors, who were indigenous to these lands now known as the Americas, where today my trans Latina sisters and I are vilified, caged, and abused,&quot; Westley said in a statement. &quot;But these systems of dehumanizing greed have grossly underestimated us.

                    <title>Tori Spelling’s marriage to Dean McDermott hit a breaking point before divorce: ‘I f---ing lost it’</title>
                    
                    <description>Tori Spelling is sharing her side of the her divorce from Dean McDermott, her husband of 18 years and father to her five children, on her new podcast.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tori Spelling is opening up about&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/tori-spelling-files-divorce-dean-mcdermott-18-year-marriage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; her divorce from her husband&lt;/a&gt; of 18 years, Dean McDermott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Fox News Digital confirmed that Spelling had filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences as the grounds to dissolve her union with McDermott. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spelling filed first, and on her new podcast, &quot;missSPELLING,&quot; she began to process the intense change to her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So, I just filed for divorce,&quot; she says in the opening moments of the show, taking a deep breath. &quot;I just filed for divorce, whoa. I said the words that I’ve said in my head for like 16 years…wild.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/candy-spelling-calls-tori-spelling-survivor-after-marriage-breakdown-hospitalization-moldy-house&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANDY SPELLING CALLS TORI SPELLING ‘SURVIVOR’ AFTER MARRIAGE BREAKDOWN, HOSPITALIZATION AND MOLDY HOUSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she discusses her and McDermott’s relationship, she also called him to inform him the news of their divorce had gone public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the podcast, McDermott calls back, but only Spelling’s side of the conversation is heard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s clear they’re speaking about the optics of her filing first, and she explains why she did so to him and listeners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I feel like I deserve to file first, then. You basically put it all out there with the Daily Mail. You said everything that you&apos;ve done to me all through the years. So I think it would make perfect sense that it&apos;s followed up with I would file. Because those are things that I would never have divulged to somebody, and you did.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/tori-spelling-financial-struggles-dean-mcdermott-blames-candy-spelling-90210-star-falls-hard-times&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TORI SPELLING FINANCIAL STRUGGLES: DEAN MCDERMOTT BLAMES CANDY SPELLING AFTER &apos;90210&apos; STAR FALLS ON HARD TIMES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spelling referred to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dean-mcdermott-blames-tori-spelling-divorce-drunken-rages-choice-barn-animals-bedroom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;McDermott’s 2023 interview&lt;/a&gt; with The Daily Mail, where he divulged intimate details of their relationship, including his struggle with addiction and her keeping barn animals in their bedroom as factors in their separation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She ends the call by telling McDermott, &quot;I love you&quot; and then says, &quot;Wait, that’s it. I’ve never felt more alone…I’ve never felt more alone in 50 years.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Spelling begins to cry and tries to laugh it off, she notes she’s surrounded by friends in a podcast studio, but still says, &quot;I don’t feel worth loving. And that’s just something that’s in you. It’s not something I wanted or created. That starts when you’re young.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the podcast, Spelling recalls her relationship with McDermott, beginning with their &quot;fairytale romance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dean and I had this fairytale romance, even though we were both married when we met — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/tori-spelling-dean-mcdermotts-marriage-was-scandalous-from-start&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;not fairytale right there,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Spelling admitted. &quot;But we had other partners that we cheated on and left, and then we got together.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added, &quot;It shouldn’t have made it 18 years, and I think he would say the same thing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;90210&quot; alum also spoke about &quot;red flags&quot; she saw in McDermott, like &quot;his temper, which was fueled by alcohol.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple married in 2006 and have five children together: Liam, Finn, Beau, Stella and Hattie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mom of five admits she thought about leaving at multiple points after the births of some of her children, but never did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having children further impacted their relationship, with Spelling saying, &quot;Our relationship was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/tori-spelling-rv-adventure-5-kids-divorce-rumors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;never the same after having kids.&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued, &quot;We always said we won’t be those parents who change. We’ll make sure we make our relationship a priority, the two of us, and have date nights, and everything went out the window. I became completely focused on the kids. And kind of left him in a way. And I get it. It doesn’t excuse his behavior and everything he did and how he handled things, and I’m not minimizing his part in this and how his lack of sobriety did affect me and the kids for years and years, and I’m really happy he’s sober now. But our relationship definitely changed, to the point where I felt like I was in this alone with the kids.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;final blow&quot; came last year after they spent the day together at her friend and co-star Jennie Garth’s house, noting McDermott (who is now sober) had been drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At home, they were having an argument that was going back and forth, and she revealed the comment that sent her over the edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He said, &apos;Ugh, I&apos;m so sick of this. I have been picking up Tori Spelling&apos;s s--- for 18 years.&apos; And I f---ing lost it,&quot; Spelling recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The podcast episode ends on that comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the divorce filing documents, the date of separation for the couple is listed as June 17, 2023, the same day &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/tori-spelling-dean-mcdermott-separate-ways-after-17-year-marriage-5-kids-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;McDermott shared a now-deleted Instagram&lt;/a&gt; post announcing their separation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spelling is requesting spousal support, while denying offering spousal support to McDermott. As for their children, she requested full physical custody and joint legal custody, with visitation rights for McDermott.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The bureau said a man attempted to follow an authorized vehicle through the gate, but was stopped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The facility&apos;s barricades were deployed to stop the vehicle. The suspect got out of the vehicle and tried to enter the facility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agents in the car he tried to follow in got out as did two other FBI agents who were leaving for lunch and detained the suspect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/fbi-interrogates-americans-over-social-media-posts-every-day-all-day-long-agent-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FBI AGENTS QUESTION WOMAN OVER ANTI-ISRAEL FACEBOOK POSTS IN VIRAL VIDEO &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The agents called &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;DeKalb County Police&lt;/a&gt; who arrested the driver.

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chair lifts at an Italian ski resort in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Swiss Alps&lt;/a&gt; were captured on video twisting and turning after being blasted by sudden gusts of wind while at least two people were still riding in the chairs on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onlookers recorded video of the frightening incident at the Cervino Ski Paradise in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/italy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Breuil-Cervinia,&lt;/a&gt; a popular tourist resort at the foot of the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Crabtree, one skier who shared video, posted on social media that 10 chairs on the lift were damaged and taken out of service by the time the lift reopened the following day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnaby Dunning, an experienced skier who was stuck in a chair lift with a friend at the time, told ABC’s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; on Monday that wind conditions reached up to 70 miles per hour. The skier said he felt like he was in a washing machine and had &quot;multiple moments of total panic and fear.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/5-people-2-children-crushed-death-winds-topple-trees-poland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 PEOPLE, INCLUDING 2 CHILDREN, CRUSHED TO DEATH AFTER WINDS TOPPLE TREES IN POLAND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I never even knew chair lifts could rotate the way that they were rotating,&quot; Dunning said. &quot;You’re just getting thrown around all over the place.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/americans-stranded-norwegian-cruise-line-after-island-excursion-left-without-money-vital-meds-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMERICANS STRANDED BY NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE AFTER ISLAND EXCURSION, LEFT WITHOUT MONEY, VITAL MEDS: REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resort told the BBC in a statement that the ski lift was closed due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/weather&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;poor weather conditions&lt;/a&gt; and those still on the lift were the last skiers making their way to the upper station. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the skiers &quot;all reached their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;destination safely,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; the statement said per the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Three girls have been arrested and charged for allegedly beating a 64-year-old Washington, DC man to death in October 2023, police announced on Friday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Three young girls have been arrested and charged in connection with the death of a 64-year-old man in northwest Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metropolitan Police Department officers responded to the 6200 block of Georgia Avenue just before 1 a.m. on Oct. 17, 2023, for a report of a man down, according to a press release. Upon arrival, officers found Brown with trauma consistent with an assault. He died at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was just a quiet, nice, polite person. He didn’t bother anybody. That’s the type of person he was,&quot; a close family friend told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fox5dc.com/news/12-year-old-murder-suspect-injured-in-separate-shooting-in-dc-family-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;FOX 5 DC&lt;/a&gt;. Local reports said Brown was physically handicapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspects, whose names are being withheld due to their age, are accused of beating to death the man, who police identified as Reggie Brown. Video played in court Friday showed the beating, local NBC4 reported. A medical examiner&apos;s autopsy revealed he died of blunt force trauma and the manner of death was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ruled a homicide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/dc-suspect-tries-setting-union-stations-freedom-bell-fire-police-investigating&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC SUSPECT TRIES SETTING UNION STATION&apos;S FREEDOM BELL ON FIRE; POLICE INVESTIGATING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, a 13-year-old girl was arrested and charged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;second-degree murder&lt;/a&gt; in connection with Brown&apos;s death. On Friday, a 13-year-old girl and a 12-year-old girl were also arrested and charged with second-degree murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A relative of the 12-year-old girl charged with killing Brown told FOX 5 the girl was shot Friday morning inside her apartment, which is about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/washington-dc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;four blocks away&lt;/a&gt; from where Brown was murdered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/dc-business-owner-slams-city-leaders-out-control-crime-lack-courage-aggressive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC BUSINESS OWNER SLAMS CITY LEADERS FOR OUT-OF-CONTROL CRIME: &apos;LACK COURAGE&apos; TO &apos;BE MORE AGGRESSIVE&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She [is] going to come through. It’s just a lot going on right now,&quot; they said. &quot;This happened around 3 in the morning. I ain’t even get no sleep.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl is expected to survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metropolitan police say the case remains under investigation and the department is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information. Anyone with information about this case is asked to call the police at 202-727-9099. Anonymous information may be submitted to the department’s text tip line by sending a text message to 50411.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three suspects reportedly have long-standing truancy issues — one allegedly did not attend a single day of classes in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As early as this week, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser could propose a plan to hold parents in the district accountable if their children miss too many school days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some residents are hoping that addressing the district’s truancy issue could help reduce juvenile crime, which has skyrocketed. A report released by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education in November said that in the 2022-2023 school year, 60% of D.C. high school students were chronically absent, meaning they were absent either all day or part of the day at least 10% of school days.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>How 155,000 copies of ‘The Great Gatsby’ were pivotal for World War II soldiers and F Scott Fitzgerald</title>
                    
                    <description>&amp;quot;The Great Gatsby&amp;quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald wasn&amp;apos;t a widely popular book right away. Free editions given to World War II soldiers helped the book gain its success.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/lifestyle-books&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;classic piece of literature&lt;/a&gt; today that has been read by millions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book set on Long Island during the Jazz Age is a work read by English classes across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story told by narrator Nick Carraway about his wealthy, mysterious neighbor, Jay Gatsby, and his love for Daisy Buchanan wasn’t always one popular among critics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/classic-must-read-books&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 MUST-READ CLASSIC BOOKS THAT HAVE REMAINED POPULAR YEARS AFTER THEIR ORIGINAL PUBLICATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitzgerald’s earlier works, &quot;The Side of Paradise&quot; (1920) and &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot; (1922), were much better received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitzgerald never got to see the success of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; in his lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, when the book was a mere $2 to buy, there were fewer than 20,000 copies sold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very last royalty check Fitzgerald received for the work before his death on Dec. 21, 1940, was for $13.13, according to the Washington Post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/world-war-two&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; saw a huge boost in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the war, the United States government came up with a program in which they shipped out pocket-sized versions of books for soldiers to read in their downtime. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was one of the books chosen for this program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books chosen fell into a wide variety of genres, so there was something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a total of 1,324 titles published in the series, according to the Library of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 155,000 free Armed Service Editions of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; given to U.S. soldiers, according to the Library of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that was when the book saw a huge boost in popularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, there have been more than 25 million copies of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; sold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story has also been made for the big screen four times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/various-movie-adaptations-f-scott-fitzgeralds-great-gatsby-filmed-over-nearly-100-years&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;newest film version of the book&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular. The Baz Luhrmann-directed movie sees Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby, Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan, Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan and Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Whoopi Goldberg claims voters have &apos;memory issues,&apos; slams &apos;stupid question&apos; about being better off 4 years ago</title>
                    
                    <description>Whoopi Goldberg suggested Americans had short term memory loss on Monday as she criticized the GOP for asking voters if they were better off now than four years ago.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The View&quot; co-host &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/whoopi-goldberg-calls-out-audience-member-using-camera-during-view&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Whoopi Goldberg&lt;/a&gt; claimed Americans had &quot;short memory issues&quot; on Monday while discussing a question posed by Republicans about whether people felt &quot;better off&quot; than they were four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So why is it some people are having short memory issues? There are plenty of other reasons to feel good about where we actually are. Why isn’t that tracking?&quot; she asked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;daytime talk show&lt;/a&gt; segment, Goldberg criticized the question and said it was &quot;disrespectful to the American people.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Black people, we were not in this insanity of trying to figure out why our history’s no longer welcome in the educational system. Women were realizing something was happening. If you were coming from another country, if you were coming to this country to find a better life, you were not welcome. Listen. It wasn’t a good time for lots of people,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/the-view-co-host-joy-behar-unleashes-on-lack-of-checks-and-balances-in-government-the-system-is-rigged&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&apos;THE VIEW&apos; CO-HOST JOY BEHAR UNLEASHES ON &apos;LACK OF CHECKS AND BALANCES&apos; IN GOVERNMENT: &apos;THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All you have to do is ask, are we better off than we were? Ask the thousands of people who are no longer here. That’s how you know if we’re better off. Ask their families. Are they better off without their loved ones? What a stupid question. It’s a stupid question and disrespectful to the American people in my opinion, in my humble opinion.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin, who worked in the Trump administration, said Republicans were committing &quot;political malpractice&quot; by asking the question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She argued that while the economy was &quot;objectively doing better&quot; under Biden, people feel they had more money in their 401ks during the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/view-co-hosts-explode-biden-report-binary-choice-good-evil&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;‘THE VIEW’ CO-HOSTS EXPLODE OVER BIDEN REPORT: ‘A BINARY CHOICE BETWEEN EVIL AND GOOD’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunny Hostin criticized the former president and said the Democratic Party could do more to stress just how &quot;terrible&quot; the four years of Trump were&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think the Democrats need to do more in getting the message out that yes, we actually are better off right now because of all of the things that Biden has done, but I will say this, you know, while Trump may have, you know, came up with this Operation Warp Speed, which I don’t know why he came up with that term, I do believe that he is responsible for mishandling the pandemic so much that over a million Americans died including my in-laws, and it is in large part, because he had his son-in-law who shouldn’t have been in the White House in the first place, handling the response. Someone with absolutely no medical history – experience,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-half-voters-worse-off-2020&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;A Fox News poll&lt;/a&gt; from March found that just 22% of voters say they are better off than four years ago, while more than twice that many, 52%, say they are worse off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poll also found that 73% of voters rated the economy negatively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The co-hosts referenced the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the segment, and Ana Navarro said she was living with anxiety every day during the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In addition to the Covid issue, which is, you know, incredibly serious and sad and cost so many lives, I can tell you that I was getting death threats. I was, you know, living a level of anxiety that I didn’t realize until after Trump left, because every day I woke up wondering what scandal, what horrible thing was he going to tweet about? What international incident was he going to cause? I mean, I couldn’t be away from news. Now I’m like playing Words with Friends and Fishdom,&quot; Navarro said. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Sunday said Hamas fighters captured by IDF forces have painted a grim picture of the terror group.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Israeli Defense Minister&lt;/a&gt; Yoav Gallant on Sunday said Hamas terrorists captured by troops said &quot;the group is collapsing from within&quot; as Israel steps up its military offensive in the Gaza Strip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the last week or two, hundreds of terrorists have been captured and what they say about what happened to them tells the whole story. They say that Hamas is collapsing from within, the price they are paying is very heavy,&quot; Gallant said, The Times of Israel reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’re going to eliminate everyone who was involved in the events of October 7, the junior [officials], the senior ones and the very senior ones; those who were inside [Israel] or who gave instructions,&quot; he said, referring to the date of Palestinian terror group Hamas’s massive attack on Israel that started the ongoing conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/world-health-organization-silent-hamas-use-gaza-hospital-terror-hq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SILENT OVER HAMAS&apos; USE OF GAZA HOSPITAL AS TERROR HQ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Israel Defense Forces said over the weekend that its troops seized a cache of weapons concealed in the maternity ward of Shifa Hospital, where a raid on the facility to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense/wars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;target Hamas&lt;/a&gt; terrorists was entering its third week. Weapons found included mortars, explosive devices, sniper rifles, assault rifles, handguns and other military equipment hidden inside patient pillows and beds, according to the IDF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that troops would invade the city of Rafah in southern Gaza. The promise comes amid concerns from the Biden administration about Israeli military operations and the mounting civilian casualties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu, 74, said he had approved the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israels-netanyahu-rebuffs-us-plea-halt-rafah-offensive-tensions-rise-ahead-washington-talks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;IDF’s &quot;operational plan&quot; for Rafah&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, saying the force was &quot;prepared for the evacuation of the civilian population and for the provision of humanitarian assistance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/pro-palestinian-protesters-disrupt-berkeley-city-council-meeting-holocaust-remembrance-vote-end-israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS DISRUPT BERKELEY CITY COUNCIL MEETING, HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE VOTE: ‘END ISRAEL’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is the right thing both operationally and internationally,&quot; he said. &quot;This will take time but it will be done. We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hamas battalions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; there for one simple reason: There is no victory without entering Rafah and there is no victory without eliminating the Hamas battalions there.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu has said there can be no victory without a military ground offensive in Rafah, the southern Gaza city where more than half of the territory&apos;s population of 2.3 million now shelters after fleeing fighting elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden administration&lt;/a&gt; and Israel were expected to hold a virtual meeting Monday to discuss Rafah. Netanyahu had canceled a previous set of meetings in Washington after the U.S. abstained from a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire and the release of all hostages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House has said a military operation in Rafah could result in mass civilian casualties and exacerbate an already dire humanitarian crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Bradford Betz contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior leader in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps&amp;apos; Quds Force, reportedly has been killed by an airstrike in Syria.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The senior &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Iranian military commander&lt;/a&gt; who reportedly was killed Monday in a suspected Israeli airstrike in Syria has played a &quot;key role&quot; in the Islamic Republic’s support of Hezbollah, a Lebanese terrorist organization, the U.S. says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department, which sanctioned Mohammad Reza Zahedi in 2010, says he has &quot;acted as a liaison to Hezbollah and Syrian intelligence services and is reportedly charged with guaranteeing weapons shipments to Hezbollah.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zahedi was a senior leader in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps&apos; Quds Force, which also has been designated by the U.S. State Department as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;foreign terrorist organization.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The IRGC-QF is one of the Iranian regime’s primary organizations responsible for conducting covert lethal activities outside of Iran, including asymmetric and terrorist operations,&quot; according to the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). &quot;Iran views terrorism as a tool that it can use to support its efforts to deter and counter its perceived foes, assert leadership over Shia Muslims worldwide, and project power in the Middle East.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/senior-leader-irans-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-reportedly-killed-syria-strike&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SENIOR LEADER OF IRAN’S ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORPS REPORTEDLY KILLED IN SYRIA STRIKE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NCTC says the IRGC-QF &quot;targets U.S., Israeli, Saudi, and UAE interests, as well as Iranian dissident groups&quot; and is comprised of between 5,000 and 15,000 of the most loyal personnel from the broader Revolutionary Guard Corps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zahedi died Monday in an alleged Israeli airstrike that hit the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, a Lebanese security source told Reuters. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Israel has not confirmed&lt;/a&gt; its involvement in the attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, when asked about the reported strike, told reporters Monday that &quot;our team is looking into it.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israeli-troops-withdraw-from-shifa-hospital-gaza-idf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISRAELI TROOPS WITHDRAW FROM SHIFA HOSPITAL IN GAZA, IDF SAYS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital following the strike that &quot;it&apos;s likely that Zahedi was a critical part of the connective tissue between Iran&apos;s IRGC Quds Force and the Assad regime in Syria and Lebanese Hezbollah.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The former is Iran&apos;s oldest state-level ally, and the latter is Iran&apos;s most successful proxy organization,&quot; he said. &quot;The Assad regime in Syria is the literal bridge between Iran and Hezbollah.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taleblu said Zahedi gained military experience in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and also briefly was &quot;the head of IRGC Air Force as well as commander of Iran&apos;s IRGC Ground Forces.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iranian media outlets also are reporting that Zahedi was the chief Quds Force official in the Syrian and Lebanese theaters between the late 2000s to the late 2010s, according to Taleblu.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Here&apos;s what you need to know about the world&apos;s largest democratic election kicking off in India</title>
                    
                    <description>India&amp;apos;s 6-week-long general election, which starts on April 19, pits Prime Minister Narendra Modi against an alliance of opposition parties; Modi first took power in 2014.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (AP) — The world’s largest democratic election could also be one of its most consequential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a population of over 1.4 billion people and close to 970 million voters, India’s general election pits &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/indian-prime-minister-narendra-modi-visits-kashmirs-main-city-discuss-development-projects&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Prime Minister Narendra Modi&lt;/a&gt;, an avowed Hindu nationalist, against a broad alliance of opposition parties that are struggling to play catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/indias-government-enact-controversial-citizenship-law-excluding-muslims-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INDIA&apos;S GOVERNMENT TO ENACT CONTROVERSIAL CITIZENSHIP LAW EXCLUDING MUSLIMS AHEAD OF ELECTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 73-year-old Modi first swept to power in 2014 on promises of economic development, presenting himself as an outsider cracking down on corruption. Since then, he has fused religion with politics in a formula that has attracted wide support from the country&apos;s majority Hindu population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India under Modi is a rising global power, but his rule has also been marked by rising unemployment, attacks by Hindu nationalists against minorities, particularly Muslims, and a shrinking space for dissent and free media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW DOES THE ELECTION WORK?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6-week-long general election starts on April 19 and results will be announced on June 4. The voters, who comprise over 10% of the world&apos;s population, will elect 543 members for the lower house of Parliament for a five-year term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The polls will be held in seven phases and ballots cast at more than a million polling stations. Each phase will last a single day with several constituencies across multiple states voting that day. The staggered polling allows the government to deploy tens of thousands of troops to prevent violence and transport election officials and voting machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India has a first-past-the-post multiparty electoral system in which the candidate who receives the most votes wins. To secure a majority, a party or coalition must breach the mark of 272 seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While voters in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/connecticut-becomes-last-states-allow-in-person-early-voting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere use paper ballots, India uses electronic voting machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO IS RUNNING?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party and his main challenger, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/indian-opposition-leader-rahul-gandhi-calls-indians-united-states-stand-democracy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rahul Gandhi&lt;/a&gt; of the Indian National Congress, represent Parliament’s two largest factions. Several other important regional parties are part of an opposition bloc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposition parties, which have been previously fractured, have united under a front called INDIA, or Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, to deny Modi a a third straight election victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alliance has fielded a single primary candidate in most constituencies. But it has been roiled by ideological differences and personality clashes, and has not yet decided on its candidate for prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most surveys suggest Modi is likely to win comfortably, especially after he opened a Hindu temple in northern Ayodhya city in January, which fulfilled his party’s long-held Hindu nationalist pledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another victory would cement Modi as one of the country&apos;s most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP clinched an absolute majority by sweeping 303 parliamentary seats. The Congress party managed only 52 seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT ARE THE BIG ISSUES?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, India has clung doggedly to its democratic convictions, largely due to free elections, an independent judiciary, a thriving media, strong opposition and peaceful transition of power. Some of these credentials have seen a slow erosion under Modi’s 10-year rule, with the polls seen as a test for the country’s democratic values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many watchdogs have now categorized India as a &quot;hybrid regime&quot; that is neither a full democracy nor a full autocracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The polls will also test the limits of Modi, a populist leader whose rise has seen increasing attacks against religious minorities, mostly Muslims. Critics accuse him of using a Hindu-first platform, endangers the country&apos;s secular roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Modi, the media, once viewed as vibrant and largely independent, have become more pliant and critical voices muzzled.Courts have largely bent to Modi’s will and given favorable verdicts in crucial cases. Centralization of executive power has strained India’s federalism. And federal agencies have bogged down top opposition leaders in corruption cases, which they deny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key issue is India&apos;s large economy, which is among the fastest growing in the world. It has helped India emerge as a global power and a counterweight to China. But even as India&apos;s growth soars by some measures, the Modi government has struggled to generate enough jobs for young Indians, and instead has relied on welfare programs like free food and housing to woo voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.N.&apos;s latest Asia-Pacific Human Development Report lists India among the top countries with high income and wealth inequality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>&apos;Common sense wave&apos; coming in November after NYPD officer&apos;s death, GOP candidate says</title>
                    
                    <description>House candidate Alison Esposito, R-N.Y., joined &amp;quot;Fox &amp;amp; Friends First&amp;quot; to discuss her race in a swing district and the need to hold violent criminals accountable.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A 25-year NYPD veteran running for Congress is hopeful that a long-overdue turning point for law enforcement is on the horizon following the murder of NYPD officer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/wife-slain-nypd-officer-jonathan-diller-delivers-emotional-eulogy-thousands-attend-funeral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jonathan Diller&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[It&apos;s] not rocket science. It&apos;s 101. Hold criminals responsible for their actions,&quot; New York congressional candidate Alison Esposito told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Fox &amp;amp; Friends First&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The government&apos;s number one job is to keep their people safe and then get out of their lives,&quot; she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-angers-law-enforcement-skipping-nypd-officers-wake-favor-fundraiser-adjust-schedule&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN ANGERS LAW ENFORCEMENT BY SKIPPING NYPD OFFICER&apos;S WAKE IN FAVOR OF FUNDRAISER: ‘ADJUST YOUR SCHEDULE’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diller&apos;s widow, Stephanie, delivered an emotional eulogy, Saturday, demanding change as thousands gathered to honor the 31-year-old fatally shot during a traffic stop by a suspect with a lengthy criminal history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How many more police officers and how many more families need to make the ultimate sacrifice before we start protecting them?&quot; Stephanie Diller pleaded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esposito said the heartbreaking words were reminiscent of two years ago, when the widow of fallen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/remembering-nypd-officer-jason-rivera-nyc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York City Det. Jason Rivera&lt;/a&gt; tearfully remarked that the system &quot;continues to fail us.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dominique Rivera begged our feckless leaders to do something about bail reform, to do something about holding criminals accountable. And it went on deaf ears. It fell on deaf ears. I pray that this is the change, the wake-up call that this city needs,&quot; Esposito said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esposito left her decades-long law enforcement career to run for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; lieutenant governor in 2022 alongside GOP gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin. She is now looking to unseat Democrat Rep. Pat Ryan in swing District 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a deep blue state, but it&apos;s really a red state with blue dots. And I submit that the last one and this coming one isn&apos;t a red wave. It is a red, white and blue wave. It is a common sense wave. This is Democrats, Republicans, Independents standing up and saying enough is enough. We want our public safety. We want to back our law enforcement first.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guy Rivera, the 34-year-old suspect accused of opening fire on Diller and his partner in Queens, has 21 prior arrests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We need more work in education,&quot; Esposito continued. &quot;We need more work making sure that children have things to do rather than turning to crime. But once the criminal is there, once they are violent repeat offenders, that&apos;s not when bail reform and criminal justice reform is supposed to take effect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>US traffic deaths fell 3.6% in 2023, the 2nd straight yearly drop. But nearly 41,000 people died</title>
                    
                    <description>Nearly 41,000 people were killed on U.S. roadways in 2023, a 3.6% drop in traffic deaths year-over-year; traffic deaths dropped for the seventh straight quarter in Q4 of 2023.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;DETROIT (AP) — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/auto/u-s-traffic-deaths-record-42915-2021&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.S. traffic deaths&lt;/a&gt; fell 3.6% last year, but still, almost 41,000 people were killed on the nation&apos;s roadways, according to full-year estimates by safety regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-safety-agency-require-automatic-emergency-braking-heavy-trucks-buses&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&lt;/a&gt; said it was the second year in a row that fatalities decreased. The agency also released final numbers for 2022 on Monday, saying that 42,514 people died in crashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/12-year-old-killed-wrong-way-crash-sister-speaks-unlicensed-illegal-immigrant-drivers-arrest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12-YEAR-OLD KILLED IN WRONG-WAY CRASH: SISTER SPEAKS OUT AFTER UNLICENSED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT DRIVER&apos;S ARREST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NHTSA Deputy Administrator Sophie Shulman said that traffic deaths declined in the fourth quarter of last year, marking the seventh straight quarterly drop that started with the second quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The declines come even though people are driving more. Federal Highway Administration estimates show that Americans drove 67.5 billion more miles last year than the previous year, a 2.1% increase. The death rate per 100 million miles driven fell to 1.26 last year, down from 1.33 in 2022, NHTSA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities have said that even with a decline, the number of deaths is still too high. Shulman blamed the problem in part on distracted driving. In 2022, an estimated 3,308 people were killed in crashes that involved distracted drivers, while 289,310 were injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost 20% of people killed in distracted driving crashes were people outside of vehicles including pedestrians, bicyclists and others, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Distracted driving is extremely dangerous,&quot; she said while kicking off a rebranded campaign against it called &quot;Put the Phone Away or Pay.&quot; The agency will start an advertising campaign this month, and law enforcement officers will crack down on the behavior in a campaign from April 4 to 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffic deaths spiked in 2021 with a 10.5% increase over 2020 as people started driving more as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-calls-covid-commission-powers-refuse-admit-they-got-it-wrong&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; started to ease. That was the highest number since 2005 and the largest percentage increase since 1975.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, authorities blamed the increase on speeding and more reckless behavior, as well as distracted driving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the increase in crash deaths then was due to people driving more as the coronavirus pandemic waned. NHTSA reported that the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled increased 2.2% to 1.37 in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Austria says it must deter Russian infiltration after allegations of spying emerge</title>
                    
                    <description>After a former Austrian intelligence officer was arrested for allegedly spying for Russia, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said Austria needs to boost its security to prevent Russian infiltration.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;VIENNA (AP) — The arrest in recent days of a former Austrian intelligence officer on serious allegations of spying for Russia suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/austria-seeks-explanation-from-germany-about-spying-reports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; needs to boost its security to thwart Russian infiltration, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The allegations against Egisto Ott, who worked for a now-defunct intelligence agency and whose arrest was announced Friday, are &quot;grave&quot; and have prompted Nehammer to call a meeting next week of Austria’s National Security Council, the chancellor said. Ott has denied wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/austrian-ex-officer-suspected-of-spying-for-russia-since-90s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUSTRIAN EX-OFFICER SUSPECTED OF SPYING FOR RUSSIA SINCE 90S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On the one hand, these allegations have to be addressed by the judiciary. On the other hand, an evaluation and clarification of the security situation of the republic is needed,&quot; Nehammer said in a statement. &quot;We have to avoid having Russian spy networks threaten our country by infiltrating or instrumentalizing political parties and networks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nehammer said he would convene the National Security Council on Tuesday of next week. The council, which consists of government ministers as well as members of all political parties, is a key advisory panel on matters of security and defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/vienna-court-convicts-alleged-accomplices-2020-islamic-state-shooting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; Criminal Court on Monday approved a 14-day extension for holding Ott in custody on the charges against him. The Vienna public prosecutor’s office declined to provide details about the spying allegations, but said that they relate to &quot;abuse of office&quot; and were &quot;detrimental to Austria.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain has arrested five Bulgarian citizens last year and a sixth one in February and has charged them with allegedly being members of a Russian spy network working together with Jan Marsalek, the fugitive former chief operating officer of Wirecard, the German payment processing company that collapsed in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joint reporting by Der Spiegel, German public broadcaster ZDF, the Austrian newspaper Der Standard and the Russian investigative platform The Insider said last month that Ott and another former Austrian intelligence officer are suspected of having spied on potential targets in Europe and having passed the information to Jan Marsalek, who they allege has had connections to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/moscow-attack-shows-putins-grip-russia-not-nearly-as-tight-as-we-think-says-ex-us-ambassador-ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; intelligence since at least 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also reported that Ott and his colleague allegedly helped Marsalek secretly escape from Austria in a private jet in 2020 after the Wirecard collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ott rejected the accusations against him as baseless in a recent interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been previous allegations against Ott. In 2017, Western intelligence agencies warned their Austrian counterparts about Ott potentially spying for Russia. Ott was suspended from his job at the BVT in 2017 and was briefly arrested in 2021, but he was released again after a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austria expelled two Russian diplomats from Russia’s embassy in Vienna last month in what Austrian officials said was related to spying.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — A bill in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/iowa-travel-guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; that would allow the state to arrest and deport some migrants is stoking anxiety among immigrant communities, leaving some to wonder: &quot;Should I leave Iowa?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation, which is expected to be signed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/iowa-gov-reynolds-desantis-aim-trump-over-misleading-tv-ad&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Gov. Kim Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;, would make it a state crime for a person to be in Iowa if previously denied admission to or removed from the United States. It mirrors part of a Texas law that is currently blocked in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/midwest-state-verge-defying-biden-texas-style-bill-combat-illegal-immigration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIDWEST STATE ON VERGE OF DEFYING BIDEN WITH TEXAS-STYLE BILL TO COMBAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across Iowa, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/iowa-latinos-emerging-as-small-but-potentially-significant-political-force&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Latino&lt;/a&gt; and immigrant community groups are organizing informational meetings and materials to try to answer people&apos;s questions. They’re also asking local and county law enforcement agencies for official statements, as well as face-to-face meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As 80 people gathered in a Des Moines public library community room last week, community organizer Fabiola Schirrmeister pulled written questions out of a tin can. In Spanish, one asked: &quot;Is it safe to call the police?&quot; Another asked: &quot;Can Iowa police ask me about my immigration status?&quot; And: &quot;What happens if I’m racially profiled?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erica Johnson, executive director of Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, the organization hosting the meeting, sighed when one person asked: &quot;Should I leave Iowa?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Entiendo el sentido,&quot; she said. I understand the sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schirrmeister, who hosts a local Spanish-language radio show, explained how long organizers have worked to build a bridge with law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s sad how it’s going to hurt the trust between local enforcement, pro-immigrant organizations and the immigrant communities,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Des Moines Police Chief Dana Wingert told The Associated Press in an email that immigration status does not factor into the department&apos;s work to keep the community safe, and he said it would be &quot;disingenuous and contradictory&quot; to incorporate it at the same time law enforcement has been working to eliminate such bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m not interested, nor are we equipped, funded or staffed to take on additional responsibilities that historically have never been a function of local law enforcement,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Iowa and across the country, Republican leaders have rallied around the refrain that &quot;every state is a border state&quot; as they accuse President Joe Biden of neglecting his responsibilities to enforce federal immigration law. That’s led Republican governors to send troops to support Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s Operation Lone Star, and legislatures to propose a variety of state-level strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iowa’s lawmakers advanced the measure to address what one lawmaker called a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; posed to Iowans by some migrants crossing the southern border. Republican Rep. Steve Holt acknowledged questions of constitutionality around the bill but ultimately argued that Iowa has &quot;the right, the duty and the moral obligation to act to protect our citizens and our sovereignty.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If we end up in a court battle with the federal government, should this pass, bring it on,&quot; Holt said during a subcommittee meeting in February. &quot;I think it’s time for every state to stand up and say … ‘we’ve had enough. We will defend our people.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas law is stalled in court, after a challenge from the U.S. Department of Justice, which says it conflicts with the federal government’s immigration authority. The department did not immediately comment on the Iowa bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iowa legislation, like the Texas law, could mean criminal charges for people who have outstanding deportation orders or who have previously been removed from or denied admission to the U.S. Once in custody, migrants could either agree to a judge’s order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge’s order must identify the transportation method for leaving the U.S. and a law enforcement officer or Iowa agency to monitor migrants&apos; departures. Those who don’t leave could face rearrest under more serious charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill in Iowa faces the same questions of implementation and enforcement as the Texas law, since deportation is a &quot;complicated, expensive and often dangerous&quot; federal process, said immigration law expert Huyen Pham of Texas A&amp;amp;M School of Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How are Iowa law enforcement agencies going to determine if someone has entered Iowa in violation of an immigration order?&quot; Pham asked. She said questions remain about which country a detained person would be sent back to, how they would get there and how agencies would communicate with those countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deportations are a binational process, she said, meaning the federal government negotiates with the governments of other countries. Disjointed immigration policy state-by-state could threaten those international relationships, Pham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico has already said that it would reject any state or local government enforcement of immigration laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iowa State Patrol, as well as representatives of multiple police departments and county sheriff’s offices across the state, declined to comment on the bill before it is signed into law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shawn Ireland, president of the Iowa State Sheriff’s and Deputies Association and a deputy sheriff in Linn County, said in an email that law enforcement officials would consult with county attorneys for guidance if the bill becomes law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ireland added that community-police relations are a priority, and law enforcement’s focus &quot;is not on looking for people who came to this country illegally and are not committing crimes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manny Galvez, leader of the Escucha Mi Voz (Hear My Voice) community group based in the rural city of West Liberty, said the bill has galvanized immigrant communities, including some that are in harder-to-reach areas of Iowa, to send the message that immigration is a human issue and that the state’s meatpacking plants, cornfields and construction projects rely on immigrant labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers advancing a bill like this one are disconnected from that reality, Galvez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Criminalizing the immigrant community is not the answer,&quot; he said. &quot;We tell people: ‘Don’t be afraid. No tengan miedo. We are going to keep fighting this.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
