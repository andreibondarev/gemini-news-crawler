                    <description>The Department of Education finalized a sweeping reversal of Trump-era Title IX reforms on Friday, a win for teachers unions that had advocated for such an action.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration&apos;s actions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-dismantles-trump-era-title-ix-rules-sidesteps-issue-trans-athletes-girls-sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;finalizing revised Title IX regulations&lt;/a&gt; represent a victory for powerful teachers unions, which have fueled Democrats&apos; 2024 election campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday morning, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/legal-experts-raise-alarm-president-bidens-plan-b-student-loan-handout&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Department of Education&lt;/a&gt; finalized sweeping new Title IX rules that it said will &quot;strengthen vital protections&quot; from sex-based harassment and prevent discrimination based on gender identity. The regulations dismantle Trump-era actions that bolstered protections, but also prescribed a strict grievance process that ensures the accused are treated as innocent until proven guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nation&apos;s two largest teachers unions, the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, have for months heavily advocated for the regulations to be finalized. During the current election cycle, the two unions have funneled millions of dollars to Democrat-aligned political action committees, but virtually nothing to Republicans, according to federal filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Prior to the 2020 rule, there was progress on changing the culture of sexual violence on our education campuses, as well as improvements to student safety. But the Trump-DeVos rule quashed open discussion of sexual harassment and gender-based violence,&quot; AFT President Randi Weingarten wrote in a comment letter supporting the Biden administration&apos;s regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-plans-even-bigger-student-loan-handout-dumping-bill-you&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN PLANS EVEN BIGGER STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT, DUMPING THE BILL ON YOU&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/randi-weingarten-gets-educated-exactly-blame-rise-homeschooling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Weingarten added that&lt;/a&gt; the administration&apos;s rules – which are set to go into effect in August – would &quot;remove dangerous regulations put in place in 2020 and put us back on the path of honestly discussing the modern realities of equal access to education.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate comment letter, NEA President Rebecca Pringle similarly praised the regulations and urged &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/dept-of-education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Education Department&lt;/a&gt; to act expeditiously to finalize them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-brags-supreme-court-stop-canceling-student-loans-happy-break-law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN BRAGS SUPREME COURT &apos;DIDN&apos;T STOP&apos; HIM FROM CANCELING STUDENT LOANS: HE&apos;S &apos;HAPPY TO BREAK THE LAW&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We commend the Department for this proposed rule, which restores crucial protections, creates uniform processes, and provides much-needed clarification and formalization of protections that further the broad mandate of Title IX to prohibit sex discrimination in education,&quot; Pringle wrote to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona and Assistant Secretary Catherine Lhamon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pringle&apos;s letter emphasized the importance of the regulations&apos; expansion of Title IX protections to include transgender students. She said they would protect a transgender student who is &quot;discriminated against and shamed when told they cannot use the bathroom.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to NEA, the regulations would prohibit schools from excluding students from any &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/west-virginia-transgender-sports-ban-overturned-federal-appeals-court&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;educational activity because of transgender status&lt;/a&gt;; prohibit &quot;misgendering&quot; transgender students or teachers, force the use of a name selected by a transgender student or teacher, and require students to be allowed to use restrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Department’s clarification of Title IX protections moves us closer to making our schools places where we are all free to thrive and support one another for who we are and where students across race, background, and gender have the freedom to learn without fear or intimidation,&quot; Pringle continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/consequences-biden-plan-cancel-student-loan-debt-according-experts-enormous-consequences&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CONSEQUENCES OF BIDEN’S PLAN TO CANCEL STUDENT LOAN DEBT, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS: ‘ENORMOUS CONSEQUENCES’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the expanded protections for transgenders in schools under Title IX, the regulations would also undo sexual assault due process rules put in place by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colleges will no longer be required to hold live hearings to allow students to cross-examine one another through representatives. Instead, college officials will be able to interview students separately, allowing each student to suggest questions and get a recording of the responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In evaluating the parties’ evidence, a school must use the &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; standard of proof unless the school uses the clear and convincing evidence standard in all other comparable proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Department of Education officials first proposed the regulations in 2022, but have delayed finalizing them to review the tidal wave of more than 240,000 public comments. The Trump-era regulations were finalized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/d/betsy-devos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos&lt;/a&gt; in May 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Civil liberties, students&apos; rights and conservative legal groups have called on the Biden administration to preserve the 2020 regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AFT and NEA didn&apos;t immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Michael Dorgan contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Chris Pratt showed off a new injury he received after attempting to perform a stunt in the making of his new movie, &amp;quot;Mercy.&amp;quot; The star showed photos of his bruised and swollen ankle on Instagram.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/chris-pratt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chris Pratt&lt;/a&gt; is looking a little worse for wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hollywood star is currently filming a new movie called &quot;Mercy,&quot; a sci-fi thriller in which he plays a detective accused of a crime he didn&apos;t commit. As he shared to social media, he&apos;s been attempting some of his own stunts, and he injured himself in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Pratt posted two photos on Instagram, the first showing his legs. On one foot, his sock and shoe have been removed and an ice pack is tied to his ankle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/chris-pratt-credits-wife-katherine-schwarzenegger-helping-maintain-ripped-physique&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHRIS PRATT CREDITS WIFE KATHERINE SCHWARZENEGGER FOR HELPING HIM MAINTAIN RIPPED PHYSIQUE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the other picture, he showed a close-up of his ankle, which appeared to be bruised and very swollen. There&apos;s also a small cut on his foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mercy filming day 4,&quot; the actor wrote in the caption of the post. &quot;I have such a great stunt team! AND I sometimes try to get in there and do some of my own stuff. Today, daddy caught a metal post to the ankle. Should be interesting moving forward.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C57O7VVphE0/?img_index=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APP USERS CLICK HERE TO VIEW PHOTOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s unclear if Pratt&apos;s injury will affect the filming schedule for the movie, or to what extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&apos;t the first time the actor injured himself doing stunts — he also got hurt in the making of 2017&apos;s &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a conversation with Seth Meyers on &quot;Late Night&quot; to promote the film, Pratt said, &quot;It&apos;s a really &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;stunt-heavy movie&lt;/a&gt;, through the course of the whole film for everyone. We were suspended from wires, we did a whole bunch of stunts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Meyers asked if all the stunts went well, Pratt replied, &quot;Not necessarily. Yeah, no. I got my bell rung pretty, pretty good one time, essentially got knocked out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, he spoke to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a36801705/chris-pratt-interview-the-tomorrow-war/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Men&apos;s Health&lt;/a&gt; about acting as executive producer on &quot;The Tomorrow War,&quot; a movie in which he also starred. Pratt was asked if his producing role gave him the ability to do more stunts that normally a producer would bar an actor from doing — a move that legendary action star &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tom-cruise&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt; is known to pull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I mean, what a mark he set,&quot; Pratt said of Cruise. &quot;I’m gonna have to perform a heart transplant on myself in a movie to ever top what he’s done. I’m a huge fan. I love him so much. I don’t know that I did anything that would make him proud in [&apos;The Tomorrow War&apos;]. I’ve got a great stunt man, Chris Romrell.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, &quot;I did one of my own stunts jumping down off of this steel beam that was like maybe 15 feet up in the air. That was kind of cool. I’m getting old, though. I’m gonna be 42. My knees are getting f---ed up. I don’t want to be doing stunts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pratt, now 44, doesn&apos;t seem to have been able to stay away from the action-packed part of filmmaking. For 2022&apos;s &quot;Jurassic World Dominion,&quot; he did several of his own stunts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Grant, a stuntman for the movie, &lt;a href=&quot;https://metro.co.uk/2022/09/29/how-chris-pratt-made-jurassic-world-dominion-stunt-teams-life-easy-17472159/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;told Metro&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;It’s only really when it comes to the vehicle stuff that [stunt double] Alister Whitton stepped in and did some of the motorbike stuff and Chris left him to more of that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>WATCH: Anti-Biden protester derails Kennedy interview with blood-curdling screams</title>
                    
                    <description>Prominent Kennedy family member Kerry Kennedy&amp;apos;s interview on CNN was derailed by an anti-Biden protester unleashing blood-curdling screams.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An interview with a prominent Kennedy family member was derailed by an anti-Biden protester on Thursday with blood-curdling screams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking with liberal outlet CNN ahead of her family offering its endorsement of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt; in Philadelphia, Kerry Kennedy — the sister of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — was overshadowed by a male protester yelling unintelligibly immediately behind her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protester appeared only briefly in CNN&apos;s shot of the interview, but video posted on X by a reporter from another outlet captured the man standing behind Kennedy screaming that he has rights and was allowed to be at the event before being physically removed. It was not immediately clear what the man was protesting about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kennedy-family-major-endorsement-2024-presidential-race-democrat-panic-grows-rfk-jr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KENNEDY FAMILY CHOOSES POLITICS OVER FAMILY WITH ENDORSEMENT IN 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RACE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the outburst, the Kennedy family, led by Kerry Kennedy, officially endorsed Biden&apos;s re-election bid. The endorsement came as a snub to RFK Jr., who they say is acting as a &quot;spoiler&quot; to Biden&apos;s re-election chances and could lead to a victory for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. reacted to the endorsement in a post on X, praising his family, but also noting that other family members were supportive of and working for his campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I hear some of my family will be endorsing President Biden today. I am pleased they are politically active — it’s a family tradition. We are divided in our opinions but united in our love for each other,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I hold this as a possibility for America, too. Can we disagree without hating our opponents? Can we restore civility and respect to public discourse? I think we can.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-biden-campaign-ad-claim-presidents-mental-fitness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH: NEW BIDEN CAMPAIGN AD MAKES SUBTLE CLAIM ABOUT PRESIDENT&apos;S MENTAL FITNESS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My campaign, which many of my family members are working on and supportive of, is about healing America — healing our economy, our chronic disease crisis, our middle class, our environment, and our standing in the world as a peaceful nation. But this will only happen if we heal our national conversation, and move from rage and fear into love and respect,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/democrats-panicked-about-third-party-candidates-swinging-election-trump-single-biggest-threat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Democratic National Committee launched an effort&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to silence the threat to Biden&apos;s re-election from third-party candidates, namely Kennedy, in the form of a team that is expected to actively combat them with legal challenges and opposition research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, members of the team have posted near-constant criticism of RFK Jr. on social media and have frequently referred to him as a &quot;spoiler&quot; candidate. They have also claimed that Kennedy is in cahoots with Trump in order to help him win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dnc-accuses-rfk-campaign-admitting-quiet-part-out-loud-leaked-2024-strategy-discussion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the DNC accused RFK Jr.&apos;s campaign&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of acknowledging its role as a &quot;spoiler&quot; after a woman associated with the campaign was captured on video discussing campaign strategy and how Trump could win the state of New York with the independent candidate on the ballot in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to video reviewed by Fox News Digital, a self-identified Kennedy campaign staffer told a room of Republicans in New York that the only way Trump could win the traditionally Democrat state in November was with Kennedy on the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If it’s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,&quot; the staffer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Brian Rodriguez, 35, faces a litany of charges after allegedly squatting in Adele Andaloro&amp;apos;s Queens home. Andaloro was arrested earlier this year for changing the locks.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A squatter who commandeered and rented out rooms in a woman&apos;s $1 million house in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Queens, New York&lt;/a&gt; pleaded not guilty to a slew of charges Thursday about a month after the homeowner was arrested for trying to change the locks to oust the intruders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 29, Brian Rodriguez forced his way back into Adele Andaloro&apos;s home after she had changed the locks, pushing his way into the house as she tried to hold the door closed, according to the Queens District Attorney. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he claimed that he was a legal tenant and Andaloro was trying to legally evict him, police had no choice but to remove Andaloro from the property – in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York,&lt;/a&gt; it&apos;s against the law to turn off the utilities, change the locks, and remove the belongings of someone who claims to be a tenant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I may end up in handcuffs today if a man shows up here and says I have illegally evicted him,&quot; Andaloro told &lt;a href=&quot;https://abc7ny.com/squatters-standoff-queens-new-york-city/14540298/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;ABC 7&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;I said &apos;let him take me to court as I&apos;ve been told to take him to court&apos; because today I&apos;m not leaving my house.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/nyc-homeowner-arrested-standoff-squatters-illegally-took-over-1-million-property&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NYC HOMEOWNER ARRESTED AFTER STANDOFF WITH SQUATTERS SHE SAYS ILLEGALLY TOOK OVER HER $1 MILLION PROPERTY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She took her case to the Queens District Attorney, the office said in their release, where an investigation was launched. A warrant was issued for Rodriguez&apos;s arrest, and he pleaded not guilty to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;five-count indictment&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez, 35, faces charges of second-degree burglary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/robbery-theft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;fourth-degree grand larceny,&lt;/a&gt; fourth-degree criminal possession of stolen property, second-degree criminal trespass and fourth-degree criminal mischief, the office wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His attorney Jerald Levine said his client&apos;s tires had been slashed and his mother had developed heart problems as a result of the press coverage surrounding the case, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2024/04/18/us-news/queens-squatter-who-rented-out-rooms-in-womans-home-arraigned-on-burglary-other-charges-da/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt; reported. He said that Rodriguez worked for a company that helped the indigent, but said he couldn&apos;t name the company in public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/squatters-burned-new-york-home-wreaking-havoc-hardworking-families-officials-say&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQUATTERS BURNED NEW YORK HOME WHILE WREAKING HAVOC ON &apos;HARDWORKING FAMILIES,&quot; OFFICIALS SAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The press is responsible!&quot; Levine shouted, according to the Post. &quot;I respectfully asked that he’d be [released on his recognizance], which is what I was told it would be before, until the press came in and whoop-whooped up the whole big to do!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Levine told Fox News Digital that Rodriguez is innocent: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everything is on the record – all I can tell you is he&apos;s not guilty,&quot; Levine said via phone. &quot;I&apos;m not getting involved with the papers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant District Attorney William Jorgenson asked Judge Toni Cimino to jail Rodriguez on $100,000 bail until his next court date on May 13, and for a restraining order to keep him away from Andaloro. Cimino granted the order of protection but released Rodriguez – a repeat offender with burglary and narcotics convictions, the Post reported – on supervised home confinement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katz told the Post that Rodriguez&apos;s case was about proving that the rule of law &quot;exists on both sides.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you walk into a house that&apos;s not yours, when you don&apos;t have permission to be there, and claim you&apos;ve got rights, that&apos;s not true! You can&apos;t just walk into a house that is not yours and claim you have a right to be there,&quot; she said. &quot;Today proves it, right?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/owner-nyc-home-went-flames-says-he-cant-get-rid-squatters-who-have-more-rights-than-him&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OWNER OF NYC HOME THAT WENT UP IN FLAMES SAYS HE CAN&apos;T GET RID OF SQUATTERS WHO &apos;HAVE MORE RIGHTS&apos; THAN HIM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told the outlet that she was grateful for the press coverage of the case to &quot;send a clear message out.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, Range Rover-driving Rodriguez told the Post he was the real victim – he&apos;d spent $25,000 fixing up the house, he&apos;d claimed, and had been tricked by a bogus real estate agent named &quot;Ronnie Ferg&quot; whom he&apos;d met at a laundromat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After he&apos;d signed a lease for $3,200 per month on the home and moved in subletters, Rodriguez claimed, he realized something was amiss when Andaloro showed up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I need a month or two to get them out,&quot; he told the Post before his arrest. &quot;I am ready to give the house back to Ms. Adele. I&apos;ll take the L on this one. The house really beat me up.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes an average of 20 months for an eviction case to be resolved in New York City, according to the Rent Stabilization Association.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>CAUGHT ON CAMERA: Fence-cutting migrants busted by feds</title>
                    
                    <description>Fox News Digital was on the ground in the El Paso Sector when multiple groups of illegal immigrants were caught just feet away from the border wall.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUNLAND PARK, N.M.&lt;/strong&gt; — Multiple groups of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;illegal immigrants&lt;/a&gt;, including one group who sliced open border fencing to enter deeper into the U.S., were stopped by Border Patrol agents last week, as officials are drawing on more resources and tools to prevent them from fleeing into the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital was on the ground in the El Paso Sector, as Border Patrol agents on an early morning patrol caught multiple groups of illegal immigrants moving into the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One group, consisting mostly of Ecuadorians, was caught down a main road from the bollard border wall separating the U.S. and Mexico. The group were checked, given water, made to take off shoelaces and hand over their belongings, before being put into a transport van to the local Border Patrol station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://foxnews.com/immigration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF THE BORDER SECURITY CRISIS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There, they will be subject to Title 8 removal proceedings, which could include a quick return to their country of origin via expedited removal, or it could mean entry into the United States as they await their immigration removal proceedings and a court hearing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another section near the port of entry, agents nabbed a group of migrants from Ecuador, Bolivia and Guatemala who had cut a hole in the border fence, but had been stopped by agents just feet from the hole. The fencing is, in some areas, reinforced by bollards, which in turn are sometimes filled with concrete in an effort to make cutting them harder. The group included two small children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agents have also found makeshift ladders and rope discarded near parts of the wall that are harder to cut through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/spike-illegal-immigrants-from-us-adversary-blows-lid-off-previous-years-record&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPIKE IN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM THIS US ADVERSARY BLOWS LID OFF PREVIOUS YEAR&apos;S RECORD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an area where smugglers have operated for years and they are notoriously vicious. They will leave migrants behind if they get injured, or send them across, knowing that they are in danger to the elements. This was the area where, in 2021, smugglers heartlessly abandoned a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/border-patrol-video-smugglers-5-year-old-3-year-old-abandoned-border&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;five-year-old and three-year-old girl&lt;/a&gt;, dropping them over the fence before they were rescued by agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Border Patrol Agent Claudio Herrera told Fox News Digital that there were nearly 600 rescues of distressed migrants in FY 23, and so far in FY 24 there have been more than 320.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unfortunately, we have seen in the past how these transnational criminal organizations stash these migrants south of the border. And they don&apos;t give them food or enough water. By the time they&apos;re already arrived at our borders, they&apos;re already dehydrated&lt;i&gt;,&quot; &lt;/i&gt;he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During some migrant surges, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;majorities of illegal immigrants&lt;/a&gt; have been turning themselves in the hope of being released. Here, that isn’t the case. One agent told Fox that the vast majority of encounters (as high as 95%) are migrants who are trying to evade Border Patrol rather than giving themselves up, suggesting that they’ve been briefed by smugglers that their chances of being returned are high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apprehensions in the sector are down sharply from last year. There were 427,471 in FY 23 by Border Patrol. So far in FY 24, which began in October, there have been just over 150,000. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) puts that decrease in part due to a multi-layered enforcement strategy that combines existing barriers, technology including autonomous surveillance towers, K-9 units and recent cooperation with state police to stop illegal entrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/caught-on-camera-crowd-illegal-immigrants-cut-razor-wire-rush-across-border-texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CAUGHT ON CAMERA: CROWDS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CUT RAZOR WIRE, RUSH ACROSS BORDER INTO TEXAS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are doing a fantastic job interdicting these individuals from smuggling schemes, in vehicles or also in the stash houses. We also have our checkpoints. We also have canines. We also have horse patrol, ATVs, you name it. We have all these different assets that help us do our job better,&quot; Herrera said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the sector, Texas has also fortified existing barriers with extra layers of razor wire, a move that has led to a legal battle with the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But looming over the Sunland Park area is Mount Cristo Rey, where there can be no border barriers, due to the jagged terrain, and small white obelisks mark where the U.S. ends and Mexico begins. It’s a perilous area for migrants and agents alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agents with whom Fox was embedded spotted a helicopter from CBP’s Air and Marine Operations (AMO) flying low over the mountain&apos;s border with Mexico, and followed up the ominous mountain, where cartel scouts were situated just on the Mexican side. A group of adult male migrants whom they were overseeing, but who had not yet reached the U.S., quickly turned back upon seeing the agents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the scouts remained just feet from the border, gesturing vulgarly at the agents and filming them and Fox’s reporter. The Border Patrol vehicle headed up the mountain and later returned, at which point the scouts had inched across into the U.S. side, but fled back over to the Mexican side when they saw the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the agents though, they don’t need to spend much time up in the mountains. With the extra levels of surveillance, including the autonomous surveillance towers that use AI to track and identify migrants, agents can track any migrants clambering across the mountain and wait for them at the bottom when they come down and have tired themselves out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get the latest updates on the ongoing border crisis from the Fox News Digital immigration hub.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The recent arrest of a Louisiana man in connection with his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/true-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;estranged wife&apos;s murder&lt;/a&gt; has rocked residents of Tangipahoa Parish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities on Monday took David Hernandez, 49, into custody on charges of second-degree murder and obstruction of justice, according to a Tuesday press release from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/louisiana&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff&apos;s Office.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 21, while responding to a medical emergency around 9 p.m. at a residence on Meadow Wood Drive in Ponchatoula, officers found David&apos;s estranged 45-year-old wife, Lisa Hernandez, &quot;lying between her bed and a dresser, covered in blood.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisa&apos;s 24-year-old daughter reportedly called authorities after finding her mother unresponsive, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fox8live.com/2024/04/17/tangipahoa-investigators-share-details-ponchatoula-womans-murder/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;FOX 8 reported.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/accused-idaho-killer-bryan-kohberger-offers-up-alibi-driving-see-moon-stars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACCUSED IDAHO KILLER OFFERS UP ALIBI: &apos;DRIVING TO SEE THE MOON AND STARRS&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A homicide investigation ensued, and investigators learned that after a year of separation, David Hernandez &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;allegedly began stalking his estranged wife&lt;/a&gt; and &quot;would randomly show up at her place of work,&quot; the sheriff&apos;s office stated in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Recently, David even sent Lisa a bouquet of flowers containing lilies, also known as the ‘death flower&apos; … which she was highly allergic to. Additionally, detectives recovered a tracking device from Lisa’s vehicle, which has also been linked to David,&quot; the sheriff&apos;s office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/child-who-survived-47-hour-abduction-state-park-credited-airtight-case-against-captor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHILD WHO SURVIVED ABDUCTION FROM STATE PARK CREDITED FOR AIRTIGHT CASE AGAINST CAPTOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials believe David &quot;staged a burglary&quot; at Lisa&apos;s residence, used items in her home to kill her and then discarded those items &quot;into Lake Pontchartrain.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Detectives were able to locate&lt;/a&gt; and recover those items during their investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/karen-read-massachusetts-trial-3-things-know-about-woman-charged-officer-boyfriends-murder&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KAREN READ MASSACHUSETTS TRIAL: 3 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT WOMAN CHARGED WITH OFFICER BOYFRIEND&apos;S MURDER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autopsy results for Lisa Hernandez are pending, though officials told FOX 8 that it appeared Lisa had been beaten with both blunt and sharp objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An obituary for Lisa states that she was &quot;a loving and compassionate mother of three girls.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GET REAL TIME UPDATES DIRECTLY ON THE &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/true-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUE CRIME HUB&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lisa was employed by St. Tammany Pediatrics where she loved working with young children,&quot; the obituary states. &quot;Besides spending quality time with her girls, Lisa was an avid reader and one of her favorite book series was Harry Potter. She would visit Universal Studios every chance she could, spending hours at the Harry Potter themed areas. She also enjoyed visiting Disney World.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisa&apos;s murder has left Tangipahoa Parish residents shocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You don’t see that so much in a sleepy little town like this,&quot; Ponchatoula resident Steve McIain told FOX 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another local told the outlet that &quot;this world has just gone crazy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Taylor Swift seemingly refers to her ongoing feud with Kim Kardashian in her new track, &amp;quot;ThanK you aIMee&amp;quot; from her surprise deluxe album, “The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since Friday&apos;s release of Taylor Swift&apos;s latest album &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-kim-kardashian-feud-make-music&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;The Tortured Poet&apos;s Department&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and her surprise double album &quot;The Tortured Poet&apos;s Department: The Anthology,&quot; Swifties have been quick to point out subtle nods to past relationships and traumas - including an ongoing feud with Kim Kardashian. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Swift&apos;s track titled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kim-kardashian&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;thanK you aIMee&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; Swift sings about a &quot;bronze, spray-tanned&quot; mean girl at school that her mom wishes were &quot;dead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All that time you were throwin’ punches, I was buildin’ somethin’ / And I can’t forgive the way you made me feel / Screamed ‘F--- you, Aimee’ to the night sky, as the blood was gushing,&apos;&quot; she sings. &quot;But I can’t forget the way you made me heal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/taylor-swifts-songs-reappear-tiktok-ahead-pop-stars-new-album-release-despite-dispute&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TAYLOR SWIFT&apos;S SONGS REAPPEAR ON TIKTOK AHEAD OF POP STAR&apos;S NEW ALBUM RELEASE DESPITE DISPUTE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she doesn&apos;t directly name Kardashian, the track&apos;s title capitalizes three letters: K-I-M. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don’t think you’ve changed much/ And so I changed your name, and any real defining clues,&quot; Swift sings on the track. &quot;And one day, your kid comes home singin’/ A song that only us two is gonna know is about you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Swift and Kardashian did not return Fox News Digital&apos;s immediate request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing feud goes back to 2016 when the Skims creator’s then-husband Kanye West rapped about how he and Swift &quot;might still have sex&quot; because he &quot;made that b---- famous.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kardashian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kim-kardashian-taylor-swift-lying-kanye-west-phone-call&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;posted a clip&lt;/a&gt; of a recorded phone call between Swift and West discussing the lyrics that would appear in the rapper&apos;s upcoming track, &quot;Famous.&quot; Swift claims she never approved of the lyrics; Kardashian said otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backlash took a toll on Swift&apos;s mental health after she was branded a &quot;liar.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A mass public shaming, with millions of people saying you are quote-unquote canceled, is a very isolating experience,&quot; she &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vogue.com/article/taylor-swift-cover-september-2019?verso=true&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;said in a 2019 interview with Vogue&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;When you say someone is canceled, it’s not a TV show. It’s a human being. You’re sending mass amounts of messaging to this person to either shut up, disappear, or it could also be perceived as, ‘Kill yourself.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be part of, since 2009,&quot; she wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift addressed the scandal with multiple diss tracks on her &quot;Reputation&quot; album in 2017, from &quot;Call It What You Want&quot; to &quot;Look What You Made Me Do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being named Time&apos;s Person of the year in 2023, Swift called the feud a &quot;bleak&quot; moment and claimed she fled to &quot;a foreign country&quot; where she &quot;didn’t leave a rental house for a year.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before,&quot; she recalled in her &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/6342806/person-of-the-year-2023-taylor-swift/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;profile in Time&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-returns-stage-three-hour-44-song-show-launches-eras-tour&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TAYLOR SWIFT RETURNS TO THE STAGE WITH EPIC THREE-HOUR, 44-SONG SHOW AS SHE LAUNCHES ERAS TOUR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More notably, the albums not only touch on her&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-break-six-years&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; six-year relationship with ex Joe Alwyn&lt;/a&gt;, but her whirlwind romance with The 1975 musician Matty Healy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Tortured Poets Department. An anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time - one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure,&quot; the pop icon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/taylorswift/p/C57c1DWMkf_/?img_index=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;wrote on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; in tandem with the album&apos;s release. &quot;This period of the author’s life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up. There is nothing to avenge, no scores to settle once wounds have healed. And upon further reflection, a good number of them turned out to be self-inflicted. This writer is of the firm belief that our tears become holy in the form of ink on a page. Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it. And then all that’s left behind is the tortured poetry.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On her opening track &quot;Fortnight&quot; - which features Post Malone - the singer describes a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-british-singer-matty-healy-dating-joe-alwyn-split-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; brief relationship that quickly turned sour&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And no one here&apos;s to blame/ But what about your quiet treason?&quot; she sings. &quot;I took the miracle move-on-drug/ The effects were temporary/ And I love you, it&apos;s ruining my life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On her track &quot;Down Bad&quot; - which seems to reference the aftermath of her breakup with Alwyn - Swfit sings, &quot;Did you take all my old clothes just to leave me here naked and alone/ In a field in my same old town that somehow seems so hollow now … How dare you think it&apos;s romantic/ Leaving me safe and stranded.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another track titled, &quot;I Can Do It with a Broken Heart,&quot; Swift sings, &quot;He said he&apos;d love me all his life/ But that life was too short … He said he&apos;d love me for all time/ But that time was quite short.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the albums just being released, fans are still actively decoding lyrics - and sharing their thoughts on the subtle clues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans believe her song &quot;The Alchemy&quot; is about her most recent romance with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-travis-kelces-coachella-date-night-sees-them-getting-cozy-backstage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NFL player Travis Kelce&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift sings, &quot;So when I touch down, call the amateurs and cut ‘em from the team.&quot; People believe &quot;touch down&quot; and &quot;the team&quot; are an obvious nod to football.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the song, Swift&apos;s lyrics seem to reference the Super Bowl champ. &quot;Shirts off and your friends lift you up over their heads / Beer sticking to the floor / Cheers chanted &apos;cause they said there was no chance / Trying to be the greatest in the league / Where&apos;s the trophy? / He just comes running over to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., released a statement shortly after Johnson&apos;s plan – four bills that amount to $95 billion in spending – survived a key procedural vote on the House floor with more Democratic support than Republican.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He bashed House GOP leaders for not linking his foreign aid proposal, particularly a bill sending money to Ukraine, to U.S. border security measures – frustration shared by other conservative foreign aid skeptics who voted to block the plan from getting a vote on final passage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[R]ather than spending the resources to secure our southern border and combating the invasion of 11 million illegals and despite repeated promises there would be no additional money going to Ukraine without first securing our border, the United States House of Representatives, under the direction of the Speaker, is on the verge of sending another $61 billion to further draw America into an endless and purposeless war in Ukraine,&quot; Gosar said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have added my name in support of the motion to vacate the Speaker. Our border cannot be an afterthought.  We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He signed onto a resolution filed by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., last month in protest of Johnson&apos;s handling of foreign aid and government spending, known as a motion to vacate – under current House rules, just one lawmaker is needed to file it to trigger a House-wide vote on booting the speaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greene refused to discuss the motion to vacate with reporters after the foreign aid vote on Friday. She posted on X soon after, however, &quot;And now there are three. Thank you to [Paul Gosar] for cosponsoring my motion to vacate Speaker Johnson!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;House leaders do not have to put Greene&apos;s resolution up for a vote unless she files it at &quot;privileged,&quot; at which point it&apos;s required that lawmakers act on it within two legislative days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., signed onto Greene&apos;s resolution earlier this week after a closed-door GOP lawmaker meeting where he threatened to call for Johnson&apos;s ouster if he did not step aside after the House floor vote on his foreign aid plan, expected on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson has faced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tensions-erupt-on-house-floor-as-conservatives-confront-johnson-on-95b-foreign-aid-plan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;furious pushback&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the right flank of his conference over most of his plan, particularly sending $60 billion to Ukraine, which has become a politically fraught topic for much of the GOP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those same foreign aid hawks have objected to some of the Israel funding being aimed at humanitarian aid in Gaza, though its inclusion was critical to winning Democratic support. In a victory for Republicans, however, it prevents any of the Israel-Gaza funding from going toward the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), a Palestinian refugee agency alleged to have ties to Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative rebels also decried House GOP leaders’ decision to combine the four bills into one before sending it to the Senate, arguing it amounted to the same $95 billion foreign aid package the Democrat-majority chamber passed earlier this year and which House Republicans oppose. Johnson has argued that packaging them together for the Senate would prevent them from neglecting the Israel bill at a time when the issue has divided the Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, more Democrats supported advancing the package to a final vote than Republicans – the numbers were 165 and 151, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I would say that I definitely understand the sentiment,&quot; Rep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., one of the Republicans who voted to block the rule, told reporters about threats to oust Johnson. &quot;I&apos;ve told the speaker myself, the American people don&apos;t expect us to win all the time, but they expect us to fight. They don&apos;t see us doing that. They don&apos;t see him doing that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good, R-Va., one of eight House Republicans who voted to oust Johnson&apos;s predecessor in early October, told reporters it was &quot;not the most prudent&quot; time to boot another leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re six months before the election, we&apos;ve got a two or three vote margin. There&apos;s a far greater degree of uncertainty in that situation than there was back in September,&quot; Good said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Focus group of voters offer ‘brutal’ take of VP Harris: Not ‘someone I want running my country’</title>
                    
                    <description>According to a recent report from the L.A. Times, voter focus groups in Arizona did not have favorable views of Vice President Harris, even among Democratic voters.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple voter focus groups in Arizona have weighed in on Vice President Harris ahead of the November election, and their responses reinforced the notion that she’s an unpopular candidate, according to a report in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-04-16/vice-president-kamala-harris-voters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;The Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days after Harris spoke in Arizona on April 12, the political group &quot;Republican Voters Against Trump&quot; invited the outlet to view videos of interviews with three different voter focus groups: one of former Trump 2016 voters who voted for Biden in 2020, one of Black voters who are disappointed with Biden, and another of &quot;California Democrats.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times reported the crossover voters’ views, stating, &quot;Their assessments were brutal. If she is helping Biden, you don’t see it. She rubs me the wrong way. She was picked because she is a demographic. The big things she had, she failed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-prediction-second-trump-term-looks-like-arizona-campaign-stop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HARRIS TO GIVTION OF ‘WHAT A SECOND TRUMP TERM LOOKS LIKE’ DURING ARIZONA CAMPAIGN STOP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gunner Ramer, the political director of Republican Voters Against Trump, summed up the views to the Times, saying, &quot;Swing voters don’t like her.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other two groups, while less antagonistic towards Harris, were not complimentary of her. &quot;In a focus group of Black voters who were disappointed with Biden, none raised their hand in support of Harris, with one participant calling her ‘the bad news bear,’&quot; the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added, &quot;A focus group of California Democrats, while they liked Harris, had to be prompted to discuss her and said she needed more influence and exposure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These views of Harris are not surprising considering she is even less popular than even President Biden and former President Trump, two historically unpopular presidents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USA Today and Suffolk University polling from last month recorded that around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-approval-rating-worse-biden-trump-poll&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;52% of registered&lt;/a&gt; voters disapprove of her performance as vice president. Additionally, only 36% of those surveyed say she is handling the job well, with 10% undecided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suffolk University Political Research Center Director David Paleologos claimed in USA Today’s report that Harris’ unpopularity will be a big talking point during this election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Usually, it&apos;s a secondary and muted discussion about vice presidents. This time, it&apos;s going to be almost a parallel and loud discussion in comparison,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/vice-president-kamala-harris-attends-celebration-bowl-in-support-of-alma-mater-it-was-a-good-game&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS ATTENDS CELEBRATION BOWL IN SUPPORT OF ALMA MATER: &apos;IT WAS A GOOD GAME&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The L.A. Times described how &quot;Harris has heard the criticism since she entered the White House&quot; and &quot;stepped up her appearances with core Democratic groups&quot; in response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This campaign cycle, the vice president has leaned into championing abortion rights. Late last year, she kicked off her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vp-kamala-harris-announces-nationwide-tour-support-abortion-rights&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fight for Our Reproductive Freedoms Tour&lt;/a&gt;, touring the nation to galvanize Biden voters over the issue of reproductive freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The L.A. Times noted that Harris’ allies &quot;believe her role as the administration’s leading voice on abortion rights will boost her and the Democratic ticket on an issue that helped carry the party to unexpected success in the 2022 midterm elections.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the outlet noted that even though she spoke out in Tucson earlier this month in response to the state Supreme Court upholding an 1864 abortion ban, focus group voters didn’t notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Several voters said in interviews in Phoenix on Monday that they were not aware Harris was in their state just a few days ago, underscoring the challenge of getting attention as a vice president in an era of information overload.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During one of the focus group interviews, Black Democratic voter Tracey Sayles said, &quot;If she is coming for us, she doesn’t show it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other voters ripped Harris as well. Retired military member Jeff Garland, who voted Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020, declared, &quot;But from what I have seen of her, she doesn’t look like someone I want running my country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden/Harris campaign views it differently. Campaign communications director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-campaign-spokesman-defunding-police-packing-supreme-court&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Brian Fallon&lt;/a&gt; told the outlet that the vice president &quot;has proven to be a highly effective messenger on issues from reproductive freedom to gun violence prevention,&quot; and that she is &quot;uniquely positioned to mobilize critical groups across the Biden-Harris coalition, including both progressives and independents.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden campaign did not immediately reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital’s&lt;/a&gt; request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A Milwaukee college student was killed during a date, and police found her body parts scattered across the city, drawing some comparisons to the &amp;quot;Milwaukee Monster&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A college student with hopes of joining the military &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;was killed&lt;/a&gt; in horrific fashion after a date with a suspect who drew comparisons to the &quot;Milwaukee Monster.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sade Robinson, 19, was allegedly dismembered by Maxwell Anderson on April 2, and law enforcement is still finding her body parts, which washed up along Lake Michigan&apos;s shores as recently as Thursday, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/wisconsin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Milwaukee County&lt;/a&gt; Sheriff&apos;s Office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remains haven&apos;t been &quot;formally confirmed&quot; as Robinson&apos;s, according to the sheriff&apos;s office, although they&apos;re confident the remains are hers. Her other remains were found on April 5, 6, and 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robinson&apos;s mother, Sheena Scrabrough, compared the suspect in her daughter&apos;s death to serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/person-interest-identified-case-human-leg-found-milwaukee-county-park&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILWAUKEE MAN CHARGED IN KILLING, DISMEMBERING MISSING 19-YEAR-OLD WOMAN: OFFICIALS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This isn&apos;t normal. This is a 2024 Jeffrey Dahmer,&quot; she said on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NancyGrace/status/1780953127719502316&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Crime Stories with Nancy Grace.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lead detective in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/true-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Dahmer&apos;s case&lt;/a&gt; doesn&apos;t believe Anderson, 33, is &quot;as charming or intelligent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retired Milwaukee police Lt. Steve Spingola, who worked Dahmer&apos;s investigation, told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsnationnow.com/banfield/man-charged-with-dismembering-not-as-charming-as-dahmer-ex-lt/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;NewsNation&lt;/a&gt; that Dahmer&apos;s seemingly magnetic personality allowed him to kill 17 men in the 1990s and stay off law enforcement&apos;s radar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-cold-case-tore-apart-family-keeps-fighting-answers-nearly-40-years-later&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;VICTIM&apos;S CAUSE OF DEATH CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES, 40 YEARS OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS LED TO SISTER&apos;S SUICIDE AND TORE FAMILY APART&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There’s a treasure trove of file of forensic evidence that’s left at his (Anderson’s) house. And on video cameras, and with witnesses, it’s a little bit different than with Dahmer,&quot; Spingola told NewsNation. &quot;Remember back in 1991, we didn’t have any of that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stark comparison, Anderson was arrested on April 4, three days after a dinner date with Robinson when a passerby found a severed leg in Warnimont Park along Lake Michigan in Cudahy, Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 2 – in between the date and the discovery of the leg – Robinson&apos;s friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/missing-persons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;reported her missing.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anderson was charged with first-degree &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;intentional homicide&lt;/a&gt;, mutilating a corpse and arson, and remains in Milwaukee County Jail on $5 million bail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/crime-college-campuses-reverts-pre-pandemic-levels-students-fear-safety&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;AT LEAST 3 FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENTS RANDOMLY ATTACKED IN 30 MINUTES PART OF SPIKE IN ON-CAMPUS CRIMES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At this point in time, we don’t believe there are any other victims out there,&quot; Milwaukee County Sheriff Denita Ball said last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anderson&apos;s preliminary hearing is scheduled for Monday, and the investigation remains ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH: DETECTIVE TALKS ABOUT DAHMER&apos;S CASE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robinson was studying criminal justice at Milwaukee Area Technical College and considered pursuing a career in the U.S. Air Force, her mother said, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2024/04/12/maxwell-anderson-charged-in-death-of-missing-milwaukee-woman-sade-carleena-robinson/73276380007/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Milwaukee County Sheriff&apos;s Office asked anyone with information about this case is call MCSO through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/MKEOEM?__tn__=-%5DK*F&quot;&gt;Milwaukee County Office of Emergency Management&lt;/a&gt; at (414) 278-4788, or to remain anonymous, contact Crime Stoppers at (414)224-Tips.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Coby White&apos;s career-high points won&apos;t count due to bizarre Play-In rule</title>
                    
                    <description>Chicago Bulls guard Coby White broke his career points total with 42 against the Atlanta Hawks to keep his season alive, but it doesn&amp;apos;t count in the record books.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Coby White&apos;s tremendous performance on Wednesday night helped his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/chicago-bulls&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chicago Bulls&lt;/a&gt; beat the Atlanta Hawks to move on in search of the final NBA Playoffs spot in the east. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, White&apos;s career-best performance won&apos;t count in the record books. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, White&apos;s 42 points is the best he&apos;s ever done in a single game – seven points better than the 37 points he dropped on March 4 against the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/sacramento-kings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sacramento Kings.&lt;/a&gt; But the Play-In Tournament, which determines the No. 7 and No. 8 seeds of each conference for the playoffs, doesn&apos;t count toward season or career records. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The odd rule for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the NBA&lt;/a&gt; isn&apos;t changing White&apos;s mind about his night on the court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m definitely counting that as my career high,&quot; he told reporters after the game. &quot;It&apos;s on the stat sheet right here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nba-bans-raptors-jontay-porter-violating-gambling-policy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NBA BANS RAPTORS&apos; JONTAY PORTER FOR VIOLATING GAMBLING POLICY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, stats totaled in the Play-In games don&apos;t just vanish into thin air, but they are only considered as records in those specific games – not for the regular season or playoffs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White was highly efficient from the field in the 131-116 win for the Bulls, shooting 15-of-21 and 9-of-10 from the free throw line to tally his 42 points. He also had nine rebounds, six assists and two steals on a night when Chicago needed to win to keep its season alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls now have a chance to win that No. 8 seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs if they defeat the Miami Heat, who fell to the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday night, 105-104. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White also saw his teammates DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vucevic drop 22 and 24 points, respectively, to help the cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls will hope that White, a favorite for Most Improved Player this season, can continue to bring his stellar play to the court Friday night in search of that playoff spot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if White were to break the 42-point total he set on Wednesday, just know that it still won&apos;t count toward the official records. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Biden &apos;doesn&apos;t have the stomach&apos; to go after Iran&apos;s oil, says Gen. Keane: &apos;It&apos;s all about China&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Fox News senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane explained why imposing secondary sanctions on China is important to thwarting Iran&amp;apos;s aggression in the Middle East.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Retired four-star Gen. Jack Keane called out the Biden administration&apos;s unwillingness to sanction Iranian oil, telling &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/a&gt;&quot; that the regime is &quot;flush&quot; with money to build their missile arsenal because of sales to China. The Fox News senior strategic analyst responded after Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke from a G7 meeting about Israel&apos;s strikes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-strikes-site-iran-retaliation-weekend-assault&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;overnight on Iran&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-announces-new-sanctions-iran-attack-israel-pressure-continue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES NEW SANCTIONS ON IRAN FOLLOWING ATTACK AGAINST ISRAEL: &apos;THE PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GEN. JACK KEANE: &lt;i&gt;The important thing is there are going to be some sanctions coming forward. Certainly missiles, drone, you mentioned the steel industry. All of that is worthwhile. But he left out what is really giving Iran the money that they have. They&apos;re flush with money. And what&apos;s that from? Oil. Oil. Oil. Oil. And that should be our focus. We need secondary sanctions going after the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chinese companies&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; that are buying all of that oil. We&apos;ve got to step up here and get on with this. The previous administration had Iran in the tank with 200,000, 300,000 barrels of oil a day. Now it&apos;s close to 4 million barrels of oil a day. No wonder they have all the money to buy ballistic missiles, rockets and other long-range missiles for their proxies because they&apos;re flush with this money. And it&apos;s unfortunate we&apos;re not going after that. I don&apos;t think we have the stomach. Because it&apos;s all about China. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan released a statement earlier this week announcing that new sanctions will be placed against Iran in the wake of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/irans-attack-israel-shines-spotlight-tehrans-advancing-nuclear-weapons-program&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;regime&apos;s attacks against Israel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new sanctions come amid Republican criticism of the Biden administration for purportedly not being tough enough on Iran, after the White House extended a waiver that allowed Iran to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/biden-admin-under-pressure-stop-billions-dollars-sanctions-relief-iran&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;access to $10 billion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; of&lt;/a&gt; previously escrowed funds in November 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a press release, Sullivan announced that President Biden is &quot;coordinating with allies and partners, including the G7, and with bipartisan leaders in Congress, on a comprehensive response.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Andrea Vacchiano contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>French Olympic athletes to receive mental health protection in response to heightened cyberbullying</title>
                    
                    <description>French athletes participating in the Paris Olympics and Paralympics will receive mental health support to combat online harassment and cyberbullying, officials said.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;French athletes at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/olympics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Paris Olympics&lt;/a&gt; will be offered better protection for their mental health, with priority given to curbing online harassment and cyberbullying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France’s Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra and Secretary of State for Digital Affairs Marina Ferrari have been discussing ways to ensure mental health is looked after at the July 26-Aug. 11 Paris Games and Aug 28-Sept. 8 Paralympics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oudéa-Castéra pointed out the continued threat of cyberbullying to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; in society in general, a risk she says is magnified when high-profile athletes are continually in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/tech/olympic-organizers-announce-plans-use-ai-sports-ahead-paris-games&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OLYMPIC ORGANIZERS ANNOUNCE PLANS TO USE AI IN SPORTS AHEAD OF PARIS GAMES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Athletes as well as many of our citizens are exposed to these risks,&quot; she said. &quot;We are implementing the tools to help our athletes, but also our young and all French people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study carried out by France’s National Institute of Sport, Expertise, and Performance (INSEP) showed that 15% of athletes have shown signs of high anxiety or depression, with the first signs of psychological difficulties beginning on average at the age of 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk factors themselves are already well-known. They include being away from family for sustained periods of time, pressure from fans, expectations from sponsors, reactions from angry gamblers losing bets, fear of failure and constant pressure to get results. These factors are magnified by constant exposure on social networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So plans are in place to better protect mental health going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting from June, the website France.sport dedicated to top-level athletes will have a &quot;Santé Mentale&quot; (Mental Health) section, which athletes can click onto. It features a guide with practical advice and a self-evaluation questionnaire. The athlete also has access to a psychologist recommended by INSEP. The same services will continue after the Games, and are also available for coaching staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INSEP will also work with other French sports organizations on a presentation to raise awareness on risks linked to mental health among athletes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France&apos;s sports minister is working with other ministries on ways to develop and support the profession of Mental Coach — someone who works closely with athletes to help with their mental preparation in order to improve their performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Olympic Village in the suburb of Saint-Denis, a safeguarding officer from the French Olympic and Paralympic delegation and three welfare officers (who are trained psychologists) will be onsite during the Games. They will offer assistance to athletes and staff members who are experiencing mental health difficulties and, if needed, they can be mobilized to support athletes who are staying outside of the main Village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safeguarding officer on site is also dovetailing as a designated person of trust who alerts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/social-media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;social network platforms&lt;/a&gt; in case of serious problems happening online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An online application called Bodyguard is already being used by the French Tennis Federation and the French soccer league to give athletes better online protection, including content arriving in their private messages if they so wish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The psychological stability of athletes deserves all of our attention. More than ever, they should feel safe and should be supported when they go through moments of difficulty or doubt or have a need to express themselves,&quot; Ferrari said. &quot;The context of (athletes&apos;) lives exposes them to increased risks. They should be cared for with regards to these risks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further discussions are scheduled to be held in the coming weeks with the main social network platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>EU commission president urges unity as Finland closes Russian borders over migration surge</title>
                    
                    <description>The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has voiced the significance of Finland&amp;apos;s decision to close its border with Russia due to a surge in migrants.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The head of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/the-european-union&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;European Union&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; executive branch said Friday that Finland&apos;s decision to close its border crossings with Russia over a surge in migrants is a security matter for the whole 27-member bloc to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made the remarks during a trip to the frontier, visiting a part of the border located in southeastern Finland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We all know how (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and his allies instrumentalize migrants to test our defenses and to try to destabilize us,&quot; von der Leyen told officials. &quot;Now Putin is focusing on Finland, and this is no doubt in response to your firm support of Ukraine and your accession to NATO.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/ursula-von-der-leyen-announces-bid-second-term-head-european-union-commission&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URSULA VON DER LEYEN ANNOUNCES BID FOR SECOND TERM AS HEAD OF EUROPEAN UNION COMMISSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 4, Finland decided to extend the closure of its border crossing points with Russia &quot;until further notice&quot; because of what the government says is a high risk of organized migration being orchestrated by Moscow. Finland&apos;s government has closed eight of its nine checkpoints with Russia. The only one that remains open is dedicated to rail travel only, and cargo trains mainly run through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finland shares an 832-mile land border &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;with Russia&lt;/a&gt;, running mostly through thick forests in the south, and to the rugged landscape in the Arctic north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is not just about the security of Finland, but it is about the security of the European Union. We are in this together,&quot; von der Leyen said after visiting the border in Lappeenranta with Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo. &quot;We should be more Finnish when it comes to security.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Von der Leyen and Orpo flew in a Finnish helicopter over the landscape of forests and towns on the border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement issued after the visit, Orpo said that &quot;the spring’s warmer weather increases the risk of Russia helping people illegally try to get to Finland via the land border … outside the border crossing points.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Von der Leyen is campaigning as a member of the conservative European People’s Party bloc for a second term in office as head of the EU’s powerful executive branch. Security is a top EPP theme ahead of the June 6-9 European Parliament elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the migrants hail from the Middle East and Africa. The vast majority of them have sought asylum in Finland, a member of the EU and NATO with a population of 5.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finland &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/nato&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;joined NATO&lt;/a&gt; in April 2023, ending decades of neutrality after the country&apos;s defeat by the Soviet Union in World War II. In March, Sweden also became a member of the trans-Atlantic alliance. The move dealt a major blow to Putin, with a historic realignment of Europe’s post-Cold War security landscape triggered by Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Donald Trump&amp;apos;s request to halt lawsuits accusing him of inciting the U.S. Capitol attack has been denied as he continues to battle his 2020 election interference case.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; lost a bid Thursday to pause a string of lawsuits accusing him of inciting the U.S. Capitol attack, while the former president fights his 2020 election interference criminal case in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington denied defense lawyers&apos; request to put the civil cases seeking to hold Trump responsible for the Jan. 6, 2021, riot on hold while the criminal case accusing him of conspiring to overturn his election defeat to President Joe Biden plays out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the latest legal setback for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, whose trial in a separate criminal case related to hush money payments made during the 2016 campaign began this week with jury selection in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-biden-should-be-in-jail-on-trial-while-blasting-ny-case-whole-world-is-watching&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP SAYS BIDEN &apos;SHOULD BE IN JAIL&apos; AND &apos;ON TRIAL,&apos; WHILE BLASTING NY CASE: &apos;THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits brought by Democratic lawmakers and police officers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 seek civil damages for harm they say they suffered during the attack, which aimed to stop Congress&apos; certification of Biden&apos;s victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has claimed he can’t be sued over the riot that left dozens of police officers injured, arguing that his words during a rally before the storming of the Capitol addressed &quot;matters of public concern&quot; and fell within the scope of absolute presidential immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington&apos;s federal appeals court ruled in December that the lawsuits can move forward, rejecting Trump&apos;s sweeping claims that presidential immunity shields him from liability. The court, however, said Trump can continue to fight, as the cases proceed, to try to prove that his actions were taken in his official capacity as president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In court papers filed last month, Trump&apos;s lawyers told the judge that &quot;basic fairness to criminal defendants&quot; warrants pausing the civil cases until after the 2020 election criminal case is resolved. They argued that allowing the lawsuits to proceed could force Trump to &quot;prematurely telegraph&quot; his defense strategies in the criminal case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mehta, who was appointed to the bench by former President Barack Obama, said the public has an interest in the prompt resolution of the civil lawsuits in addition to the criminal case. And the judge said &quot;appropriate safeguards&quot; can be put in place to allow for the lawsuits to advance without infringing on Trump&apos;s Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/supreme-court&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; is set to hear arguments next week on Trump’s claim that he is immune from criminal prosecution in the election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith. The ruling will determine whether Trump will have to stand trial in the case accusing him of a sprawling conspiracy to stay in power after Americans voted him out of office.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>New Trump voter fraud squads begin gearing up for &apos;election integrity&apos; fight</title>
                    
                    <description>The RNC and Trump campaign unveiled their election integrity unit in key battleground states to monitor and possibly challenge vote-counting in November&amp;apos;s election.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former President &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Donald Trump&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; campaign and the Republican National Committee say they&apos;ll field a massive team of 100,000 lawyers and volunteers in the key battleground states to monitor and possibly challenge the counting of votes in November&apos;s election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement released Friday morning, the Trump campaign and the RNC touted the launch of what they called &quot;the most extensive and monumental&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/voter-fraud-concerns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; election integrity&lt;/a&gt; program in the nation&apos;s history.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is expected to be a crucial part of what the RNC calls its &quot;commitment to ensuring transparency and fairness in the 2024 elections.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Election integrity is the foundation of our democracy,&quot; recently installed RNC chair Michael Whatley said in a statement. &quot;Through this unprecedented program, we are mobilizing lawyers and volunteers who are committed to preserving the sanctity of our elections.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6350326361112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH: NEW RNC CHAIR SAYS ELECTION INTEGIRTY TOP PRIORITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump campaign and the RNC say that they plan to deploy what they describe as &quot;aggressive attorneys&quot; to monitor voting machine testing, early voting, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Election Day voting&lt;/a&gt;, mail-in ballot processing, and canvassing, audits and recounts following the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HEAD HERE FOR LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the announcement, the plans also call for hotlines in the battleground states, which poll watchers and concerned voters can call to report potential problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lawyers will guide poll watchers through the appropriate election code and provide clarity on how various issues should be answered, resolved or escalated,&quot; according to the announcement. &quot;This system will be operational from the first day of early voting through election day – and afterward if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A majority of states enforce rules regulating partisan monitoring at polling sites, in order to prevent voter intimidation and obstruction of voting. While partisan monitoring is permitted, it isn&apos;t allowed to interfere in the voting process other than to report issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new program underscores the former president&apos;s emphasis on election integrity. For years, Trump has repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims that his 2020 election loss to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt; was due to massive voter fraud. And he has been indicted in two criminal cases for his alleged efforts to undermine and overturn those election results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former president and his allies have also claimed that Democrats will try to rig the 2024 election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Having the right people to count the ballots is just as important as turning out voters on Election Day. Republicans are now working together to protect the vote and ensure a big win on November 5th!&quot; Trump said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/republicans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The RNC —&lt;/a&gt; under then-chair Ronna McDaniel — announced in October that it planned to recruit and train tens of thousands of poll workers and watches in the crucial battleground states in the 2024 election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Trump became the GOP&apos;s presumptive presidential nominee, he installed Whatley as RNC chair, and his daughter-in-law Lara Trump as co-chair. Whatley and Lara Trump, as well as RNC chief counsel Charlie Spies, hammered out the new program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>The House of Representatives is teeing up a vote on four individual foreign aid bills after they survived a key test vote on Friday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Speaker &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mike-johnson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mike Johnson’s&lt;/a&gt; $95 billion foreign aid proposal survived a key test vote Friday morning, setting House lawmakers up to consider its four individual components sometime Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a stunning break from modern historical precedent, more Democrats voted for the GOP proposal than Johnson&apos;s fellow Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats bucked party norms to support the plan through a procedural hurdle known as a &quot;rule vote&quot; after conservative foreign aid skeptics defected from Republicans to try to block the plan. It passed 316-94, with 165 Democrats and 151 Republicans in favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-takes-key-test-vote-johnsons-foreign-aid-plan-after-dems-help-advance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;advanced the proposal&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday night, said before the Friday vote, &quot;Democrats are providing the votes necessary to advance this legislation to the floor, because at the end of the day, so much more is at stake here than petty [brinkmanship].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-rebels-derail-johnsons-border-security-pitch-fury-95b-foreign-aid-plan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;GOP REBELS DERAIL SPEAKER JOHNSON’S BORDER BILL AMID FURY OVER FOREIGN AID&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule vote now sets up debate on the four individual bills followed by amendment votes and four votes on passage sometime Saturday. It’s highly unusual for Democrats, or any opposition party, to cross the aisle on a rule vote, but it underscores the urgency that lawmakers on both sides feel about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/johnson-unveils-plan-fund-israel-ukraine-closed-door-house-gop-meeting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sending aid to foreign allies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 55 Republican dissidents on this latest rule vote illustrate the fractured House Republican Conference that Johnson is trying to manage, with the House Freedom Caucus and their allies having wielded outsized influence for much of this term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of the four bills fund Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific. A fourth bill includes national security priorities like the House’s recently passed crackdown on TikTok’s ownership, as well as the REPO Act, which would liquidate seized Russian assets and give that funding to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6351121595112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SENATE VOTE ON MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT REACHES &apos;UNPRECEDENTED TERRITORY&apos;: CHAD PERGRAM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson’s push for foreign aid has infuriated members on the right of his House GOP conference, putting added pressure on the Louisiana Republican as he also navigates a historically slim majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., threatened to oust Johnson if he did not step aside after a House vote on his foreign aid plan. Massie is now signed onto Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s, R-Ga., motion to vacate resolution, which, if deemed &quot;privileged&quot; by Greene, would force the House to begin voting on Johnson’s potential ouster within two legislative days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/definition-of-insanity-frustrated-house-republicans-blast-gop-rebels-threat-oust-johnson&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&apos;DEFINITION OF INSANITY&apos;: FRUSTRATED HOUSE REPUBLICANS BLAST GOP REBELS&apos; THREAT TO OUST JOHNSON&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massie said during debate ahead of the final vote, &quot;I&apos;m concerned that the speaker&apos;s cut a deal with the Democrats to fund foreign wars rather than to secure our border.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greene’s amendment to strip all Ukraine funding from the foreign aid bill is slated to get a vote on Saturday ahead of the vote on final passage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Chicago voter confronts Mayor Johnson over &apos;disrespectful&apos; migrant funding, says city united against him</title>
                    
                    <description>Chicago voters are pushing back against Mayor Brandon Johnson for his &amp;apos;insulting&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;disrespectful&amp;apos; migrant funding plan that would re-allocate tax dollars to illegal immigrants.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An outraged Chicago resident spoke out against Mayor Brandon Johnson for re-purposing tax dollars for illegal immigrants shortly before the city is set to vote on a $70 million proposal to bolster sanctuary city resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;P-Rae&quot; Easley called out Johnson for the &quot;disrespectful&quot; effort to use residents&apos; hard-earned tax dollars for the migrant crisis &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/shows/fox-and-friends&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;during &quot;Fox &amp;amp; Friends,&quot; &lt;/a&gt;but also thanked him for inadvertently uniting the city against the proposal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s the most disrespectful thing we&apos;ve ever encountered in our lives,&quot; Easley told Lawrence Jones on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;ve been paying property taxes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/chicago&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in the city&lt;/a&gt; for generations, and to see them so openly give our money to people who don&apos;t deserve it is very insulting. … I want to thank our mayor for uniting the city in a way that we haven&apos;t seen since the &apos;96 Bulls, and that&apos;s against him and this progressive agenda,&quot; she said later in the interview, referencing the NBA team&apos;s dynasty under Michael Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chicago-mayor-urges-biden-grant-work-permits-half-million-illegal-immigrants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CHICAGO MAYOR URGES BIDEN TO GRANT WORK PERMITS TO HALF MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her remarks come after she and other residents showed up in force at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/black-chicago-voters-rip-mayor-extra-70m-migrants-recall-petition-gathers-steam&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;City Council meeting on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; to protest the liberal mayor&apos;s request for an additional $70 million in taxpayers&apos; funds to be spent on tackling the migrant crisis, while a petition that would give residents the right to recall the mayor is gathering traction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The progressive mayor, who has vigorously defended the city’s sanctuary policies in the past, wants aldermen to greenlight the extra cash despite the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cms.foxnews.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=5975086&amp;amp;action=edit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Windy City&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; having already poured $300 million into housing, food and health care for migrants, according to the city&apos;s latest numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They&apos;re showing up here in New York and Chicago attacking people in the streets,&quot; another resident said on Wednesday. &quot;The police are fighting with them in the… shelters that you guys are funding.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/cdc-sends-response-team-chicago-migrant-shelter-measles-outbreak&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC SENDS RESPONSE TEAM TO CHICAGO MIGRANT SHELTER AMID MEASLES OUTBREAK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $70 million, should the full City Council approve the proposal, will be drawn from the city’s assigned fund balance from 2022, Budget Director Annette Guzman said Monday, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2024/04/15/migrant-crisis-city-funding-mayor-johnson-city-council-preckwinkle-lobbying-black-caucus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chicago Sun-Times.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easley slammed city leaders for entertaining the allocation given the fact the city has struggled to provide funding for basic city resources like education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s extremely insulting,&quot; she said. &quot;They&apos;ve been telling us my entire life that they don&apos;t have money for this. They don&apos;t have money for that. We have to compromise. We must go without, but now we&apos;re seeing that they are able to print money out of the clear blue sky, and we want to know why wasn&apos;t our tax money given to us?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easley suggested that because the city has been united against Johnson&apos;s progressive agenda, Chicago voters are likely to head to the polls in droves in November to invoke change at the national level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are looking forward to bringing back Donald John Trump Sr. as our 47th president,&quot; Easley said. &quot;He&apos;s the only president who has a plan to close the southern border, which is going to cut off the pipeline of human and drug trafficking that&apos;s flooding the West side of Chicago, and we cannot wait to get you back in office. Mr. President, please come see us in Chicago.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Michael Dorgan and Garrett Tenney contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>EPA designates 2 forever chemicals used in cookware as hazardous substances</title>
                    
                    <description>The Environmental Protection Agency has designated two forever chemicals used in cookware, carpets and firefighting foams as hazardous substances, officials said.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; on Friday designated two forever chemicals that have been used in cookware, carpets and firefighting foams as hazardous substances, an action intended to ensure quicker cleanup of the toxic compounds and require industries and others responsible for contamination to pay for its removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designation as a hazardous substance under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Superfund law&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t ban the chemicals, known as PFOA and PFOS. But it requires that releases of the chemicals into soil or water be reported to federal, state or tribal officials if they meet or exceed certain levels. The EPA then may require cleanups to protect public health and recover costs that can reach tens of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFOA and PFOS have been voluntarily phased out by U.S. manufacturers but are still in limited use and remain in the environment because they do not degrade over time. The compounds are part of a larger cluster of forever chemicals known as PFAS that have been used since the 1940s in industry and consumer products including nonstick frying pans, water-repellent sports gear, stain-resistant rugs and cosmetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/forever-chemicals-found-us-drinking-water-map-shows-hot-spots-highest-levels&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&apos;FOREVER CHEMICALS&apos; FOUND IN US DRINKING WATER, MAP SHOWS &apos;HOT SPOTS&apos; OF HIGHEST LEVELS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term PFAS is short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. The chemicals can accumulate and persist in the human body for long periods. Evidence from animal and human studies indicates that exposure to PFOA or PFOS may lead to cancer or other health problems, including liver and heart damage and developmental problems in infants and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final rule issued Friday follows strict limits set by the EPA on certain PFAS in drinking water that will require utilities to reduce them to the lowest level they can be reliably measured. Officials say the drinking water rule, announced April 10, will reduce exposure for 100 million people and help prevent thousands of illnesses, including cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, three chemical companies announced they had reached a $1.18 billion deal to resolve complaints of polluting many U.S. drinking water systems with PFAS. DuPont de Nemours Inc., The Chemours Co. and Corteva Inc. said they would establish a fund to compensate water providers for contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And earlier this month, chemical manufacturer 3M Co. announced it will begin payments to many U.S. public drinking water systems as part of a multibillion-dollar settlement over contamination with forever chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/biden-admin-enacts-first-pfas-forever-chemical-limits-drinking-water&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN ADMIN ENACTS FIRST-EVER PFAS &apos;FOREVER CHEMICAL&apos; LIMITS ON DRINKING WATER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden&apos;s administration &quot;understands the threat that forever chemicals pose to the health of families across the country,&apos;&apos; EPA Administrator Michael Regan said. &quot;Designating these chemicals under our Superfund authority will allow EPA to address more contaminated sites, take earlier action and expedite cleanups — all while ensuring polluters pay for the costs to clean up pollution threatening the health of communities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the final rule, the EPA issued a notice clarifying that the agency will focus enforcement efforts on businesses and people who significantly contribute to the release of PFAS chemicals into the environment, including companies that have manufactured PFAS or used it in the manufacturing process, as well as federal agencies and other responsible groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS used in firefighting foam has tainted groundwater on and near military bases and other locations where it’s used in training exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Superfund law allows the EPA to clean up contaminated sites across the country and forces parties responsible for the contamination to either perform cleanups or reimburse the government for EPA-led cleanup work. When no responsible party can be identified, Superfund gives the EPA money and authority to clean up contaminated sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EPA’s action follows a report by the National Academies of Science that calls PFAS a serious public health threat in the U.S. and worldwide. The EPA said in 2022 that PFOA and PFOS are more dangerous than previously thought and pose health risks even at levels so low they cannot currently be detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Uhlmann, the EPA&apos;s assistant administrator for enforcement and compliance, called the Superfund designation &quot;a major step toward holding polluters accountable for significant releases of PFAS into the environment.&apos;&apos; Officials &quot;intend to exercise our enforcement discretion to focus on significant sources of PFAS contamination,&apos;&apos; he said, not farmers, municipal landfills, water utilities, municipal airports or local fire departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/water&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Water utilities&lt;/a&gt;, fire departments and other groups had complained that an earlier EPA proposal could have imposed unfair costs on them without defined cleanup standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal designation will ensure that manufacturers most responsible for widespread PFAS contamination will bear the costs of cleaning it up, said Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz, a lawyer for the environmental group Earthjustice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it &quot;just got a lot harder&quot; for polluters including chemical companies that long manufactured PFAS &quot;to pass the costs of their PFAS releases off on impacted communities and taxpayers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erik Olson, a health expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the EPA’s action will help protect millions of American families exposed to the toxic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We all learned in kindergarten that if we make a mess, we should clean it up,&quot; he said. &quot;The EPA’s Superfund rule is a big step in the right direction for holding polluters accountable for cleaning up decades of contamination.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>The Biden administration has sent 50 Haitians back to their country, marking its first deportation flight in months to the Caribbean nation, officials said.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Biden administration&lt;/a&gt; sent about 50 Haitians back to their country on Thursday, authorities said, marking the first deportation flight in several months to the Caribbean nation struggling with surging gang violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Homeland Security Department said in a statement that it &quot;will continue to enforce U.S. laws and policy throughout the Florida Straits and and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/regions/caribbean&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Caribbean region&lt;/a&gt;, as well as at the southwest border. U.S. policy is to return noncitizens who do not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities didn&apos;t offer details of the flight beyond how many deported Haitians were aboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-national-security-faces-major-risks-gangs-battle-control-over-haiti&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US NATIONAL SECURITY FACES MAJOR RISKS AS GANGS BATTLE FOR CONTROL OVER HAITI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data, said a plane left Alexandria, Louisiana, a hub for deportation operations, and arrived in Cap-Haitien, Haiti, after a stop in Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marjorie Dorsaninvil, a U.S. citizen, said her Haitian fiancé, Gerson Joseph, called in tears from the Miami airport Thursday morning to say he was being deported on a flight to Cap-Haitien with other Haitians and some from other countries, including the Bahamas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He promised to call when he arrived but hadn&apos;t done so by early evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joseph lived in the U.S more than 20 years and has a 7-year-old U.S. citizen daughter with another woman. He had a deportation order dating from 2005 after losing an asylum bid that his attorney, Philip Issa, said was a result of poor legal representation at the time. Though Joseph wasn’t deported previously, his lawyer was seeking to have that order overturned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/haiti-waits-kenyan-police-mission-fight-gangs-fears-wont-come&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HAITI WAITS FOR KENYAN POLICE MISSION TO FIGHT GANGS AMID FEARS THEY WON&apos;T COME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joseph was convicted of theft and burglary, and ordered to pay restitution of $270, Issa said. He has been detained since last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dorsaninvil said her fiancé has &quot;nobody&quot; in Haiti. &quot;It is devastating for me. We were planning a wedding and now he is gone,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 33,000 people fled Haiti’s capital in a span of less than two weeks as gangs pillaged homes and attacked state institutions, according to a report last month from the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration. The majority of those displaced traveled to Haiti’s southern region, which is generally peaceful compared with Port-au-Prince, which has an estimated population of 3 million and is largely paralyzed by gang violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haiti’s National Police is understaffed and overwhelmed by gangs with powerful arsenals. Many hospitals ceased operations amid a shortage of medical supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. operated one deportation flight a month to Haiti from December 2022 through last January, according to Witness at the Border. It said deportation flights were frequent after a camp of 16,000 largely Haitian migrants assembled on the riverbanks of Del Rio, Texas, in September 2021 but became rare as fewer Haitians crossed the border illegally from Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haitians were arrested crossing the border from Mexico 286 times during the first three months of the year, less than 0.1% of the more than 400,000 arrests among all nationalities. More than 150,000 have entered the U.S. legally since January 2023 under presidential powers to grant entry for humanitarian reasons, and many others came legally using an online appointment system at land crossings with Mexico called CBP One.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homeland Security said Thursday that it was &quot;monitoring the situation&quot; in Haiti.&quot; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/coast-guard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.S. Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt; repatriated 65 Haitians who were stopped at sea off the Bahamas coast last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haitian Bridge Alliance, a migrant advocacy group, urged a halt in deportation flights to Haiti, saying Thursday that the U.S. was &quot;knowingly condemning the most vulnerable, who came to us in their time of need, to imminent danger.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Republicans seizing on the issue in an election year, the Biden administration has emphasized enforcement, most notably through a failed attempt at legislation, after record-high border arrests in December. Arrests for illegal crossings dropped by half in January and have held pretty steady since then after Mexico stepped up enforcement south of the U.S. border. Biden says he is considering executive action to halt asylum at the border during times when illegal crossings reach certain thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>&apos;American Idol&apos; alum, gospel singer Mandisa dead at 47</title>
                    
                    <description>Mandisa, a gospel singer and a contestant on the fifth season of &amp;quot;American Idol,&amp;quot; has died at the age of 47, Fox News Digital can confirm.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mandisa, a gospel singer who kicked off her singing career as a contestant on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/shows/american-idol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;American Idol,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; has died. She was 47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandisa&apos;s father, John Hundley, confirmed her passing to Fox News Digital, saying that her death was a total shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this time, it&apos;s unclear what caused the singer&apos;s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandisa competed on season five of &quot;American Idol,&quot; which aired in 2006. She made it to the top nine in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/american-idol-helps-loretta-lynns-granddaughter-follow-legendary-singers-footsteps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;music competition&lt;/a&gt; show, and a year later, she released her first full-length album, titled &quot;True Beauty.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her time on &quot;American Idol,&quot; she became known not only for her powerhouse vocals, but also for an inspiring speech she gave to judge Simon Cowell. After her audition, Cowell made remarks about her weight, and later in the process she confronted him about his comments in a conversation with him and his fellow judges Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Simon, a lot of people want me to say a lot of things to you,&quot; she began. &quot;But this is what I want to say to you is that, yes, you hurt me and I cried and it was painful, it really was. But I want you to know that I&apos;ve forgiven you and that you don&apos;t need someone to apologize in order to forgive somebody. I figure that if Jesus could die so that all of my wrongs could be forgiven, I can certainly extend that same grace to you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cowell immediately gave her a hug, telling her that he felt &quot;humbled,&quot; then noting that he felt &quot;one millimeter small.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His comments helped inspire the name of her first album – in 2013, she told the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/mandisa-christian-music-success-good-629179/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Hollywood Reporter&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Coming straight off ‘American Idol,’ and having Simon Cowell talk to me about the way I look, I recorded ‘True Beauty,’ [asking questions like] ‘where am I going to put my value?’, ‘am I going to determine my worth by people like Simon or am I going to put my trust into what God says about me?’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Story is developing. Check back for updates.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Poland detains 2 suspects in attack on Alexei Navalny ally in Lithuania</title>
                    
                    <description>Two Polish citizens have been detained in connection with the assault on Russian activist Leonid Volkov in Vilnius, Lithuania. The attack occurred on March 12.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two men have been detained &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Poland&lt;/a&gt; on suspicion that they attacked Russian activist Leonid Volkov — an ally of the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny — on the orders of foreign intelligence services, officials said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volkov was attacked on March 12 outside his home in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, where he lives in exile. The attacker smashed one of his car’s windows, sprayed tear gas into his eyes and hit him with a hammer, police said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda announced the arrests to reporters in Vilnius and thanked Poland for its work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/alexei-navalnys-death-represents-major-blow-political-dissent-russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALEXEI NAVALNY&apos;S DEATH REPRESENTS MAJOR BLOW TO POLITICAL DISSENT IN RUSSIA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Two people have been detained in Poland on suspicion of beating Russian opposition leader Leonid Volkov. I thank the Republic of Poland for the excellent work it has done. I have discussed this with the Polish president and thanked them for their excellent cooperation,&quot; Nausėda said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both suspects are Polish citizens previously known to police in their homeland. They traveled to Vilnius before the attack on Volkov and returned to Warsaw afterward, according to Lithuania’s deputy police chief, Saulius Briginas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said they were detained on April 3 in an operation in which Lithuanian police participated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithuania expects them to be handed over in May, chief prosecutor Justas Laucius told reporters. If convicted on charges of causing bodily harm, they face up to three years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/alexei-navalny-funeral-family-putin-arch-nemesis-gather-say-goodbye-moscow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALEXEI NAVALNY FUNERAL: FAMILY OF PUTIN ARCH-NEMESIS GATHER TO SAY GOODBYE IN MOSCOW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Poland, Joanna Adamowicz, the spokesperson for a Warsaw court, said that the two men were put under arrest until May 13, on suspicion that &quot;they had organized on the territory of the Lithuanian Republic an assault and caused damage to the health of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Russian citizen&lt;/a&gt; L. W.,&quot; while &quot;being active in an organized group and carrying out the orders of the special services of an alien country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volkov&apos;s last name is spelled with a &quot;w&quot; in Polish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court in Warsaw&apos;s Praga district has decided to hand them over to Lithuania for the purpose of a criminal investigation, on the condition that they would serve any potential punishment in Poland, Adamowicz said in an email to The Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their lawyers have lodged complaints and the files have been sent to the Appeals Court in Warsaw, she said. It was not immediately clear how long the appeals could take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poland&apos;s Central Investigation Bureau of Police confirmed that its officers worked with Lithuanian police to arrest two people suspected of an attack on a Russian opposition activist in Lithuania in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developments came a day after Poland announced the arrest of a Polish man suspected of being ready to spy on behalf of Russia’s military intelligence in an alleged plot to assassinate Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volkov said on X, formerly Twitter, that he didn’t know the details of the arrest, but &quot;saw how energetically and persistently the Lithuanian police have worked over the past month on this case&quot; and was &quot;very glad that this work has paid off.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As for the details, we will find them out soon. Can’t wait to find out!&quot; Volkov wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volkov suffered a broken arm in the brutal attack and was hospitalized. He accused &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin’s&lt;/a&gt; &quot;henchmen&quot; at the time of responsibility in the attack and vowed to keep up his opposition work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack took place nearly a month after Navalny’s unexplained death in a remote Arctic penal colony. He was Russia’s best-known opposition figure and Putin’s fiercest critic. Navalny had been imprisoned since January 2021 and was serving a 19-year sentence on charges of extremism widely seen as politically motivated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposition figures and Western leaders laid the blame on the Kremlin for his death — something officials in Moscow vehemently rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navalny&apos;s funeral in the Russian capital on March 1 drew thousands of supporters, a rare show of defiance in Putin’s Russia amid an unabating and ruthless crackdown on dissent. Navalny&apos;s widow, Yulia, vowed to continue his work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volkov used to be in charge of Navalny’s regional offices and election campaigns. He ran for mayor of Moscow in 2013 and sought to challenge Putin in the 2018 presidential election. Volkov left Russia several years ago under pressure from the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Former President Trump warned of the consequences of losing his presidential immunity argument, while saying that if he loses that protection, so will “crooked&amp;quot; President Joe Biden.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former President Trump warned of the consequences of losing his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-hear-arguments-trump-presidential-immunity-case-april-25&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;presidential immunity&lt;/a&gt; argument, saying that if he loses that protection, so will &quot;crooked&quot; President Joe Biden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee argued that presidential immunity is essential to the proper functioning of the presidency in a Friday post to his Truth Social account. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Without presidential immunity, it would be impossible for a president to properly function, putting the United States of America in great and everlasting danger!&quot; he posted, in all capital letters. &quot;If they take away my presidential immunity, they take away crooked Joe Biden’s presidential immunity.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court of the United States is expected to hear arguments on presidential immunity Thursday, and eventually rule on whether Trump is immune from prosecution on charges stemming from Special Counsel Jack Smith’s election interference investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump pleaded not guilty to charges brought by Smith, and has claimed presidential immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-criminal-trial-is-having-a-reverse-effect-campaigns-new-york-bodega-vows-save-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP SAYS CRIMINAL TRIAL IS HAVING A &apos;REVERSE EFFECT,&apos; AS HE CAMPAIGNS AT NEW YORK BODEGA, VOWS TO SAVE CITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump said that without immunity from prosecution, the presidency &quot;will lose its power and prestige, and under some leaders, have no power at all.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-hear-arguments-trump-presidential-immunity-case-april-25&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUPREME COURT TO HEAR ARGUMENTS IN TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY CASE ON APRIL 25&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Presidency will be consumed by the other Branches of Government. That is not what our founders wanted!&quot; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another post, Trump argued that if a president does not have immunity, &quot;the Opposing Party, during his/her term in Office, can extort and blackmail the President by saying that, ‘if you don’t give us everything we want, we will Indict you for things you did while in Office,’ even if everything done was totally Legal and Appropriate.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That would be the end of the Presidency, and our Country, as we know it, and is just one of the many Traps there would be for a President without Presidential Immunity,&quot; Trump posted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pointing to his presidential predecessors, and 2020 and 2024 opponent Biden, Trump said: &quot;Obama, Bush, and soon, Crooked Joe Biden, would all be in BIG TROUBLE.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If a President doesn’t have IMMUNITY, he/she will be nothing more than a ‘Ceremonial’ President, rarely having the courage to do what has to be done for our Country,&quot; Trump continued, calling for the protection of presidential immunity. &quot;MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hush-money-trial-who-are-jurors-hear-braggs-case-against-2024-presidential-gop-candidate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP HUSH MONEY TRIAL: MEET THE JURORS WHO WILL HEAR BRAGG&apos;S CASE AGAINST THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump added that if immunity is not granted to a president, &quot;every president that leaves office will be immediately indicted by the opposing party.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Without complete immunity, a president of the United States would not be able to properly function,&quot; he said again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump posted about the issue on his Truth Social platform while he sat in a New York City courtroom for day four of his criminal trial stemming from charges brought against him by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bragg charged Trump last year with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The charges are related to alleged hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump pleaded not guilty to all counts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump and his attorneys sought to delay the trial, which began Monday, until after the Supreme Court ruled on the issue of presidential immunity on April 25. That request was denied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump is required to be in court every day for the criminal trial, which is expected to last through early June. Court for the criminal trial is expected for every day except Wednesdays, and Monday, April 29. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump and his attorneys argued that the former president should be able to attend the Supreme Court arguments on immunity next Thursday, but Judge Juan Merchan, who is presiding over the trial, denied that request as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Arguing before the Supreme Court is a big deal, and I can certainly appreciate why your client would want to be there, but a trial in New York Supreme Court … is also a big deal,&quot; Merchan said this week, rebuffing Trump lawyer Todd Blanche’s request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merchan added, &quot;I will see him here next week.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has said it would fast-track the appeal, and a ruling on the issue of presidential immunity is expected by mid-June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s criminal trial on charges brought against him by Smith has been put on hold pending resolution on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith charged the former president with conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights. Those charges stemmed from Smith’s investigation into whether Trump was involved in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and any alleged interference in the 2020 election result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be the second time this term the Supreme Court will hear a case involving the presumed Republican presidential nominee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Supreme Court sided unanimously with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;2024 presumptive Republica&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;n nominee in his challenge to Colorado’s attempt to kick him off the 2024 primary ballot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high court ruled in favor of Trump&apos;s arguments in the case, which will impact the status of efforts in several other states to remove &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/presidential-primaries&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the likely GOP nominee&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from their respective ballots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court considered for the first time the meaning and reach of Article 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars former officeholders who &quot;engaged in insurrection&quot; from holding public office again. Challenges have been filed to remove Trump from the 2024 ballot in over 30 states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Israeli carried out a &amp;quot;limited&amp;quot; strike against Iran on Friday, targeting the country&amp;apos;s Isfahan province, which is where Natanz, one of Iran&amp;apos;s nuclear facilities, is located.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Israel carried out limited strikes in Iran early Friday in retaliation for Tehran firing a barrage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/israel-on-alert-as-iran-launches-drones-toward-jewish-state&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;missiles and drones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at Israel last Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the key facts you need to know about the latest escalation of violence between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News confirmed there have been explosions in Iran&apos;s Isfahan province, which is where Natanz, one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/disasters/nuclear&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is located. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A well-placed military source has told Fox News that the strike was &quot;limited.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-nuclear-energy-mountain-is-fully-safe-after-israeli-strike-state-media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRAN&apos;S &apos;NUCLEAR ENERGY MOUNTAIN&apos; IS &apos;FULLY SAFE&apos; AFTER ISRAELI STRIKE: STATE MEDIA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the attack, Iranian state media stated that the nation&apos;s atomic sites were &quot;fully safe&quot; and had not been struck by the missiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Atomic Energy Agency, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/united-nations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;United Nations affiliate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; watchdog organization, later confirmed &quot;there is no damage to Iran’s nuclear sites.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been no reports of large-scale damage or casualties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior Iranian official reportedly told Reuters on Friday that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-senior-official-says-country-has-no-plan-respond-israeli-strike-immediately-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tehran has no immediate plans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to strike back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That official said &quot;the foreign source of the incident has not been confirmed,&quot; and &quot;the discussion leans more towards infiltration than attack.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/reports-israels-retaliatory-strikes-iran-reactions-lawmakers-right-defend-itself&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPORTS OF ISRAEL&apos;S RETALIATORY STRIKES AGAINST IRAN PROMPT REACTIONS FROM LAWMAKERS: &apos;RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iranian state media reportedly has been downplaying Friday’s strikes. A well-placed military source has told Fox News that the strikes were &quot;limited.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The explosion this morning in the sky of Isfahan was related to the shooting of air defense systems at a suspicious object that did not cause any damage,&quot; Iranian army commander Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi was quoted by The Associated Press as saying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel and its government have been notably quiet leading up to and following the retaliatory strike on Iran. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Israel will do whatever it needs to defend itself,&quot; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement before the Israeli strike. &quot;[Foreign leaders] have all sorts of suggestions and advice. I appreciate that. But I want to be clear: Our decisions we will make ourselves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Israel Defense Forces spokesman Jonathan Conricus wrote on X following the strike that while Iran appears to downplay the strike, he &quot;think[s] they&apos;ve gotten the message.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has denied any involvement in the strike, having pleaded with Israel for days to respond with restraint against Iranian strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/secretary-of-state#&amp;amp;_intcmp=lb_israel-strikes-iran-in-retaliation-for-weekend-assault_postclickthru_14_article1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Secretary of State Antony Blinken,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when asked about Israel&apos;s strikes on Iran Friday, said, &quot;I&apos;m not going to speak to that except to say that the United States has not been involved in any offensive operations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What we&apos;re focused on, what the G7 is focused on, and again, it&apos;s reflected in our statement and in our conversation, is our work to de-escalate tensions, to de-escalate from any potential conflict. You saw Israel on the receiving end of an unprecedented attack,&quot; he added. &quot;But our focus has been on, of course, making sure that Israel can effectively defend itself, but also de-escalating tensions, avoiding conflict.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Bradford Betz, Jennifer Griffin, Greg Norman and Elizabeth Pritchett contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Biden takes heat over gaffe urging Americans to &apos;choose freedom over democracy:&apos; &apos;Get this man out of office!&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Social media users trashed President Biden for another gaffe he appeared to make while speaking at a rally in Philadelphia on Thursday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Critics of President Biden slammed him on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; for making a puzzling statement encouraging voters to &quot;choose freedom over democracy&quot; by re-electing him to the presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservatives expressed confusion over Biden’s message, and others insisted it was yet another gaffe showing his cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden made the claim while accepting the formal presidential endorsement of the Kennedy family in Pennsylvania on Thursday. During the political rally, half a dozen Kennedy family members appeared alongside President Biden to publicly back him over Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who is running as an independent candidate for president in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-threatened-with-jail-he-misses-hush-money-trial-biden-campaigns-pennsylvania&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP THREATENED WITH JAIL IF HE MISSES HUSH MONEY TRIAL AS BIDEN CAMPAIGNS IN PENNSYLVANIA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy Jr.’s own sister Kerry Kennedy spoke at the event, stating, &quot;President Biden has been a champion for all the rights and freedoms that my father and uncles stood for.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being introduced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/jesse-watters-kennedys-everything-bidens-wanted-to-be&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Kennedys&lt;/a&gt;, Biden addressed the crowd. Toward the end of his speech, he asked, &quot;Are you ready to choose unity over division? Dignity over demolition? Truth over lies? Are you ready to choose freedom over democracy? Because that&apos;s America.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last stanza turned heads with its seemingly contradictory message. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author and Canary CEO Dan K. Eberhart commented, &quot;He&apos;s fine. Everything&apos;s fine. Biden is definitely not in severe mental decline. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commentator Ian Miles Cheong appeared confused by Biden’s statement, posting, &quot;What did he mean by this?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative journalist Nick Sortor also asked, &quot;What the hell is this guy saying?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journalist Marlo Nawfal posted, &quot;Dems really need to upgrade his [operating system] or something...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2-kennedy-children-endorse-opponent-progressive-los-angeles-da-parole-hearing-rfks-killer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;2 KENNEDY CHILDREN ENDORSE OPPONENT OF PROGRESSIVE LOS ANGELES DA, CITE PAROLE HEARING FOR RFK&apos;S KILLER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative political influencer &quot;Bad Hombre&quot; remarked, &quot;Biden says he wants you to ‘choose freedom OVER democracy.’ Joe’s DOJ, state prosecutors, and Secretaries of State have been working tirelessly to get rid of democracy. Just another Freudian slip.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The account for outlet &quot;The Conservative Brief&quot; posted about the gaffe, stating, &quot;When people were concerned about Ronald Reagan having cognitive decline near the end of his second term, it was nothing like this. When Dan Quayle couldn&apos;t spell &apos;potato&apos; correctly, people lost their minds. But it was nothing like this. When George W. Bush was in the Oval Office, and people said Dick Cheney was running the country because he couldn&apos;t, it was nothing like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look in the mirror and ask yourself, truthfully, if this is the man you want in charge of our security, our economy, and our country for another four years?&quot; the post added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative podcast host Rob Coates urged voters, &quot;Dear lord, get this man out of office!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
