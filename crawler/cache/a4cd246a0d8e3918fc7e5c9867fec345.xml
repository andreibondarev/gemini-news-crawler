                    <title>US faces &apos;inevitable&apos; ISIS attacks at home following Moscow massacre: retired general</title>
                    
                    <description>Retired Gen. Frank McKenzie warned of the Islamic State terror group&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;inevitable&amp;quot; threat to the U.S. and other foreign powers after the deadly attack in Moscow.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The former head of U.S. Central Command warned Sunday that the Islamic terror group ISIS has a &quot;strong desire&quot; to attack the U.S. and other foreign powers, a threat he suspects is growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retired Gen. Frank McKenzie told ABC News&apos; &quot;This Week&quot; that U.S. officials should &quot;believe them when they say that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think the threat is growing,&quot; McKenzie said, noting threats from ISIS-K after the group took responsibility for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/isis-k-attack-moscow-highlights-growing-terror-threat-afghanistan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;deadly attack in Moscow, Russia&lt;/a&gt;, last month that killed more than 140 people. The terror group also claimed responsibility for a mass bombing in Iran in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It began to grow as soon as we left Afghanistan, it took pressure off ISIS-K,&quot; McKenzie said, referring to the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from the country in 2021. &quot;So I think we should expect further attempts of this nature against the United States as well as our partners and other nations abroad. I think this is inevitable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/polish-leader-warns-prewar-era-urges-european-nations-invest-defense&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POLISH LEADER WARNS OF &apos;PREWAR ERA,&apos;URGES EUROPEAN NATIONS TO INVEST IN DEFENSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKenzie, who commanded U.S. forces in the Middle East, including the withdrawal from Afghanistan, said the U.S. holds a large enough military presence in Iraq and Syria to combat extremists in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retired general maintains that the U.S. should have kept a small troop presence in Afghanistan amid the exit instead of completely pulling out and ending the longest war in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Biden previously claimed there would be an &quot;over-the-horizon capability&quot; to &quot;act quickly and decisively&quot; in Afghanistan, even with troops no longer stationed in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKenzie said the U.S. now has &quot;almost no ability to see into that country and almost no ability to strike into that country,&quot; which he says benefits &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ISIS and other terror groups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you can keep pressure on them ... in their homeland and their base, it makes it hard for them to conduct these types of attacks,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, we no longer place that pressure on them, so they&apos;re free to gain strength, they&apos;re free to plan, they&apos;re free to coordinate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKenzie said he believes &quot;things would be different&quot; and &quot;we might actually be safer than we are&quot; if the U.S. and its allies kept a small presence in Afghanistan, prolonging military involvement in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deadly attack in Moscow on March 22 highlights the threat of terror groups being able to regroup and plan large-scale operations, McKenzie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the dangers, these efforts by the terror groups are more easily detectable, McKenzie said. The U.S. said it alerted the Kremlin to a possible terror plot weeks before that attack happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/swedens-defense-ministry-warning-brace-war-sends-public-panic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SWEDEN&apos;S DEFENSE MINISTRY WARNING TO BRACE FOR &apos;WAR&apos; SENDS PUBLIC INTO PANIC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think there was probably good opportunity for the Russians to have averted this attack had they actually listened to the material that was presented to them,&quot; McKenzie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspects in the Moscow attack opened fire in one of the largest shopping and entertainment complexes in Russia before a fire broke out in the complex, according to the Russian Foreign Security Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. counter-terrorism official told the New York Post that ISIS-K terrorists could cross through the U.S. borders and carry out an attack similar to the one in Moscow. The official said ISIS is growing &quot;bolder&quot; and that its members may attempt to take advantage of the chaos at the southern border and seek out a &quot;bigger&quot; target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;An attack on US soil is definitely a possibility,&quot; the official said. &quot;It would certainly send a message.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKenzie&apos;s comments on Sunday also come after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;European leaders&lt;/a&gt; warned about the prospect of war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk called on European nations to step up investment in their defense, arguing that the continent is not ready for the current &quot;prewar era.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t want to scare anyone, but war is no longer a concept from the past,&quot; he said in a recent interview with European newspapers before pointing to Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. &quot;It’s real, and it started over two years ago.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in January, Swedish defense officials warned about potential war as the nation was close to joining NATO, which has officially happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For a nation for whom peace has been a pleasant companion for almost 210 years, the idea that it is an immovable constant is conveniently close at hand,&quot; Swedish Civil Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin said at the time at Folk och Försvars, or &quot;Society and Defense,&quot; annual national conference in Sälen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But taking comfort in this conclusion has become more dangerous than it has been for a very long time,&quot; he said. &quot;Many have said it before me, but let me do so in an official capacity, more plainly and with naked clarity: There could be war in Sweden.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Denny Hamlin pulls off Richmond victory over dominant Martin Truex Jr</title>
                    
                    <description>Denny Hamlin&amp;apos;s solid pit stop and driving ability helped him hold off Martin Truex Jr. and Joey Logano to win the Toyota Owners 400 on Sunday night.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/auto/nascar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Denny Hamlin&lt;/a&gt; picked up his second win of the season as he held off Joey Logano, Kyle Larson and Martin Truex Jr. at Richmond Raceway on Sunday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The race went into overtime after an incident involving Larson and Bubba Wallace with about two laps to go. Larson got loose and checked up the track with two laps to go, causing Wallace to get into the back of him and spin him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leaders pit and Hamlin came out ahead with Logano behind him. Larson was able to have a good pit stop and get back ahead of Wallace, who fell to 16th on the restart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamlin got a good jump to restart the race and was able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/auto/attributes/racing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;fend off Truex&lt;/a&gt;. The No. 19 led for a majority of the race and his frustrations boiled over at the end, bumping Larson a few times after the race was over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truex was frustrated talking to Fox Sports, believing that Hamlin got a jump ahead of crossing the line in the restart zone. The broadcaster said NASCAR wasn’t investigating the final laps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nascar-xfinity-series-driver-joey-gase-throws-wrecked-bumper-dawson-cram-race&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NASCAR XFINITY SERIES DRIVER JOEY GASE THROWS WRECKED BUMPER AT DAWSON CRAM DURING RACE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truex led 228 of the 400 laps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a hometown win for Hamlin – and the 53rd of his career. He already picked up a victory at the Food City 500 two races ago and appears to be in the driver’s seat for the NASCAR playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logano needed a good finish after a brutal start to the season. He finished below the top 25 in three of the first seven races. He was 22nd at Bristol and 11th at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/byron-wins-circuit-americas-nascars-first-road-race-season&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Circuit of the Americas&lt;/a&gt;. A second-place finish should boost his confidence heading into Martinsville next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chase Elliott, Christopher Bell, William Byron, Brad Keselowski, Chris Buescher and Tyler Reddick rounded out the top 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larson picked up a Stage 1 victory and Truex won Stage 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Massive 5-alarm fire breaks out at Brooklyn Catholic church during Easter Sunday services</title>
                    
                    <description>The New York Fire Department worked to put out a five-alarm fire at Our Lady of the Rosary Pompeii Church in Brooklyn during the afternoon on Easter Sunday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A five-alarm fire interrupted Easter services &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;at a Catholic Church in Brooklyn on Sunday,&lt;/a&gt; prompting a massive response from the New York Fire Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire broke out at Our Lady of the Rosary Pompeii on Seigel Street in Bushwick just before 2 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video posted on X showed the flames shooting out of the church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least six people were being treated for injuries sustained in the fire, the FDNY posted on X. Three parishioners and three firefighters were among those injured, and all their injuries were said to be minor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-drive-restaurant-featured-new-brad-pitt-film-goes-flames&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLORIDA DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT FEATURED IN NEW BRAD PITT FILM GOES UP IN FLAMES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire department said parishioners smelled smoke, evacuated the building, and called for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While Easter services were being conducted, parishioners smelled smoke and immediately evacuated. There were about 150 parishioners inside. We responded to the adjoining building of the church,&quot; said First Deputy Commissioner Joseph Pfeifer. &quot;The fire was intense and quickly escalated to five-alarms.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/fires&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fire officials said the fire was put out&lt;/a&gt; on the first floor, but had extended to the second floor. The church portion of the building was saved, except for some water damage, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/neighbors-rescue-new-jersey-couple-trapped-major-house-fire&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEIGHBORS RESCUE NEW JERSEY COUPLE TRAPPED IN MAJOR HOUSE FIRE: &apos;WE&apos;RE HERE, WE&apos;RE HERE&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;One of our firefighters fell from the second floor through to the first floor while they were fighting the fire. Other firefighters gave a mayday, and not realizing the mayday was for him, he bounced up off the floor and wanted to run back up the stairs to address the mayday. He was uninjured and able to continue to fight the fire. This just shows the bravery of all our members as they’re out here trying to save lives,&quot; said Assistant Chief Michael Meyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire was under control at 5:18 p.m. and FDNY Fire Marshals are investigating the cause of the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People get very connected to their parish, so when you see a fire rip through the parish center and the rectory, you know those people that were in the mass that got out safely… They’re not going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/occasions/holiday&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;have the joy of Easter fully today &lt;/a&gt;because they are mourning what has happened to their own church,&quot; Brooklyn Diocesan spokesperson, John Qualione told PIX 11 News. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>FDNY firefighters forced to remove ‘Thin Red Line’ flag after Dem&apos;s office called it a political symbol</title>
                    
                    <description>NYC firefighters were were ordered to remove a &amp;quot;Thin Red Line&amp;quot; flag after receiving a complaint from a Democratic councilwoman’s office that it was a &amp;quot;political symbol.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Top brass at the FDNY ordered an East Village ladder company to remove a &quot;Thin Red Line&quot; flag after receiving a complaint from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/democrats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Democratic councilwoman’s&lt;/a&gt; office relaying concerns from a constituent that the flag was too &quot;politically charged.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A staffer from Democratic Councilwoman Carlina Rivera emailed Intergovernmental Affairs Coordinator Madison Hernandez March 19 relaying the concerns of a constituent who questioned whether Ladder Co. 11 was violating department rules by flying the flag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The constituent was told, according to Rivera’s staffer, that the flag was flown to &quot;honor deceased firefighters,&quot; according to an email of the exchange obtained by &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2024/03/31/us-news/fdny-firefighters-forced-to-remove-flag-honoring-9-11-heroes-after-nyc-pol-questioned-if-its-a-political-symbol/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;The New York Post&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;[H]owever he brought up that they could’ve used an FDNY flag rather than a politically charged symbol.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is to both his and our understandings that private political symbols aren’t permitted to be displayed on public vehicles,&quot; the staffer, Lisander Rosario, said. &quot;Can you confirm if there are any violating flags/symbols on Ladder 11?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;thin red line&quot; flag is intended to convey solidarity with firefighters. It is a variation on the original &quot;thin blue line&quot; flag that shows support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;police officers&lt;/a&gt;. The thin blue line flag became most visible in 2020 as a reaction to defund the police movements that swept the country in the wake of the police custody death of George Floyd. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same year, then-Commissioner Daniel Nigro implemented a rule that trucks may not fly thin red line flags because it violated department rules on &quot;altered&quot; versions of U.S. flags. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-angers-law-enforcement-skipping-nypd-officers-wake-favor-fundraiser-adjust-schedule&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN ANGERS LAW ENFORCEMENT BY SKIPPING NYPD OFFICER&apos;S WAKE IN FAVOR OF FUNDRAISER: ‘ADJUST YOUR SCHEDULE’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the interaction with the constituent, FDNY Deputy Chief Joseph Schiralli told the firefighters at the East 2nd Street firehouse that the thin red line flag must come off, per reporting from The Post. He is said to have told the firefighters he agreed it was &quot;ridiculous&quot; to remove the flags. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That move stoked an uproar on social media. Conservative activist Rogan O’Handley, who goes by @DC_Draino on X, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DC_Draino/status/1771224324663349282&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;tweeted a photo&lt;/a&gt; of the flag displayed, noting that FDNY Firefighters were &quot;forced to remove ‘red line’ flag from fire truck hung to memorialize their fallen brothers in 9/11.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivera, who voted to defund the NYPD of $1 billion, said her officer never contacted Ladder Co. 11 about the issue. She said the complaint originated from a constituent and not one of her staff members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for FDNY told Fox News Digital it received a complaint from a local elected official’s office that expressed &quot;concerns about a flag on the fire truck deemed inappropriate.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When the complaint reached the top leadership of the Department, the Chief Department and Fire Commissioner approved the flag to be flown from the apparatus,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivera’s office did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The Browns initially lived in Utah – which, much like the United States, has strict laws prohibiting bigamy in its Mormon-heavy state – but fled to Nevada to begin a new life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kody had four wives: Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn, and a total of 18 children. Christine and Kody separated two years ago, and she has since re-married. Janelle and Kody separated in December 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints abandoned polygamy in 1890 and strictly prohibits it today. The Browns consider themselves to be fundamentalist Mormons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Court blunder mars NCAA women&apos;s tournament game between Texas, NC State</title>
                    
                    <description>Before Texas and NC State faced off in the women&amp;apos;s Elite Eight on Sunday, the NCAA was made aware the three-point line distances were different on each side of the court.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Texas Longhorns and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/north-carolina-state-wolfpack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NC State Wolfpack&lt;/a&gt; women’s basketball teams experienced an odd discrepancy before their Elite Eight matchup on Sunday night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The NCAA&lt;/a&gt; was made aware that the distances of the three-point lines on each side of the Moda Center court in Portland, Oregon, were different. It was an issue that arose over the weekend via The Athletic, as the three-point distances were seemingly there during UConn’s win over Duke on Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After officials measured the three-point distances on the court before tip-off between the Longhorns and Wolfpack, it was confirmed by the NCAA that they were different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it didn’t hinder the game as NC State head coach Wes Moore and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/texas-longhorns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Texas head coach&lt;/a&gt; Vic Schaefer both agreed to play with the lines already on the court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ESPN broadcast was where the report first came, adding that the court had been the same one used throughout the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NCAA released a statement at halftime confirming the issue, saying the court will be fixed heading into Monday night’s Elite Eight game between UConn and USC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The NCAA was notified today that the three-point lines on the court at Moda Center in Portland are not the same distances,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;The two head coaches were made aware of the discrepancy and elected to play a complete game on the court as is, rather than correcting the court and delaying the game. The court will be corrected before tomorrow’s game in Portland.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organization didn’t explain how the discrepancy came to be in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. 3 NC State ended up taking down No. 1 Texas, 76-66, to move on to the Final Four. They will take on the undefeated South Carolina Gamecocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A suspect in Washington, D.C. attempted to set the Freedom Bell at Union Station on fire, despite the sculpture being made of bronze. Police are investigating the matter.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A suspect in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/washington-dc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; tried to set the Freedom Bell outside of Union Station on fire, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D.C. officials confirmed the incident on social media Sunday night. Misinformation online led many to believe that the suspect tried to set themselves on fire, but no injuries have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;An individual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/odd-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;attempted to set fire&lt;/a&gt; to the bell outside the station,&quot; District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department said on X. &quot;There was no person on fire, contrary to a report on social media.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No injuries and this is a law enforcement matter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/washington-dc-law-allowing-noncitizens-vote-elections-challenged-lawsuit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WASHINGTON DC LAW ALLOWING NONCITIZENS TO VOTE IN ELECTIONS CHALLENGED BY LAWSUIT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One X user was perplexed by the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How do you set fire to a metal bell?&quot; the social media user wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bell, popularly known as the Freedom Bell, is a sculpture designed to resemble the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. It was a gift from the American Legion, a veterans organization, a few years after the 1976 bicentennial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/washington-dc-law-allowing-noncitizens-vote-elections-challenged-lawsuit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WASHINGTON DC LAW ALLOWING NONCITIZENS TO VOTE IN ELECTIONS CHALLENGED BY LAWSUIT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bronze bell has stood outside of Union Station since 1981, over 6 years after it was authorized by Congress. It is owned by the National Park Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Metropolitan Police Department&lt;/a&gt; for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>London police officer sparks outrage after suggesting swastikas should be &apos;taken into context&apos; to Jewish woman</title>
                    
                    <description>A British police officer was filmed having a heated discussion with a Jewish woman who was offended by a swastika at an anti-Israel march in London, England.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Video of a police officer in London having a heated discussion with a woman about the offensiveness of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/anti-semitism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;swastikas&lt;/a&gt; has circulated across social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilykschrader/status/1774121298613965178&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The video&lt;/a&gt; was taken on Saturday during a massive pro-Palestinian rally that the Metropolitan Police were monitoring. In the video, a visibly upset woman confronted the officer about an anti-Israeli participant who allegedly showed off a swastika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officer did not seem to agree that swastikas are offensive symbols that threaten public order. He cited the Public Order Act 2023, which he said outlines and limits what police handle at protests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Under what context is a swastika not disrupting public order?&quot; the woman argued. She repeated her question multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/world-health-organization-silent-hamas-use-gaza-hospital-terror-hq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SILENT OVER HAMAS&apos; USE OF GAZA HOSPITAL AS TERROR HQ&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I haven&apos;t said anything about it, that it is or it isn&apos;t,&quot; he replied. &quot;Everything needs to be taken into context, doesn&apos;t it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yeah, but it&apos;s a context of a hateful march,&quot; another woman chimed in, while the first woman shot back, &quot;Why does a swastika need context?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why is a swastika not immediately antisemitism?&quot; the woman added. &quot;Why does it need context? This is what I’m confused about. This isn’t even about Israel. In what context is a swastika not antisemitic and disruptive to public order?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t have an in-depth knowledge of signs and symbols,&quot; the officer said. &quot;I know the swastika was used by the Nazi Party during their inception and their period of being in power in Germany.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/pro-palestinian-protesters-disrupt-berkeley-city-council-meeting-holocaust-remembrance-vote-end-israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS DISRUPT BERKELEY CITY COUNCIL MEETING, HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE VOTE: ‘END ISRAEL’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two continued arguing before the officer acknowledged that some symbols produce &quot;mass alarm.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now, if you came up to me and you felt mass alarm and distressed about a symbol that someone was…,&quot; he said before being interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m extremely distressed. I&apos;m very alarmed,&quot; the woman responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On X, the Metropolitan Police posted a statement about the incident that implied the video had been taken out of context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The video is a short excerpt of what was a 10-minute conversation with an officer,&quot; the response read. &quot;During the full conversation, the officer establishes that the person the woman was concerned about had already been arrested for a public order offence in relation to a placard.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The officer then offered to arrange for other officers to attend and accompany the woman to identify any other persons she was concerned about amongst the protestors, but after turning to speak to his supervisor, she then unfortunately left.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the video was posted, social media users criticized the police officer&apos;s responses to the woman&apos;s arguments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That officer is qualified to be an Ivy League university president,&quot; one X user joked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our police force have reached a new low,&quot; a British commentator wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And his grandfather probably risked his life fighting the Nazis in World War II. What a shame,&quot; another speculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; for additional comment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Legendary actress Barbara Rush, the Golden Globe winner who starred in &amp;quot;It Came from Outer Space&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Peyton Place&amp;quot; has died at the age of 97.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Barbara Rush, the Golden Globe-winning star of &quot;It Came from Outer Space&quot; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/robert-hogan-the-wire-peyton-place-dead-87&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Peyton Place&quot;&lt;/a&gt; has died. She was 97.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rush&apos;s daughter and Fox News Channel senior correspondent Claudia Cowan confirmed her beloved mother&apos;s death to Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My wonderful mother passed away peacefully at 5:28 this evening. I was with her this morning and know she was waiting for me to return home safely to transition,&quot; Cowan shared. &quot;It’s fitting she chose to leave on Easter as it was one of her favorite holidays and now, of course, Easter will have a deeper significance for me and my family.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legendary actress, whose career spanned seven decades across the stage, screen and television, starred opposite some of Hollywood&apos;s most iconic leading men including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/01/25/sound-music-actress-angela-cartwright-reveals-what-it-was-really-like-working-with-julie-andrews-christopher-plummer.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Paul Newman&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Rock Hudson, Dean Martin, Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra and Richard Burton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rush launched her acting career on the stage, performing at the Pasadena Playhouse, where she was spotted by a talent scout who signed her to Paramount Pictures in 1950. She made her big-screen debut in the 1950 film &quot;The Goldbergs,&quot; which was based on Gertrude Berg&apos;s comedy-drama radio and television broadcast of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/batman-actress-barbara-rush-reflects-on-befriending-rock-hudson-marilyn-monroe-and-more-hollywood-icons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘BATMAN’ ACTRESS BARBARA RUSH REFLECTS ON BEFRIENDING ROCK HUDSON, MARILYN MONROE AND MORE HOLLYWOOD ICONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After starring in 1951&apos;s &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; and 1952&apos;s &quot;Flaming Feather,&quot; Rush made her career breakthrough in the 1953 science fiction horror movie &quot;It Came From Outer Space.&quot; In 1954, Rush won the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/golden-globes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Golden Globe Award &lt;/a&gt;for most promising newcomer – female for her performance in the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rush teamed up with Rock Hudson for the first time in the 1954 Western movie &quot;Taza, Son of Conchise.&quot; The two would reunite that same year for the romantic drama &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; and again in the 1955 adventure movie &quot;Captain Lightfoot.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a 2018 interview with Fox News Digital, Rush shared fond memories from her experiences working with Hudson, who died in 1985 at the age of 59 from AIDS-related complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He started off in film pretty much the same time I did,&quot; she said. &quot;He was a lot of fun to be with. He had a wonderful sense of humor. He loved to laugh. We just had the best time working.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rush gained further prominence after starring in the critically-acclaimed 1956 drama &quot;Bigger Than Life&quot; opposite James Mason. In 1956, Rush played socialite Margaret Freemantle, the love interest of American soldier Michael Whiteacre &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dean-martin-king-of-cool-tcm-documentary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;(Dean Martin&lt;/a&gt;) in the World War II drama &quot;The Young Lions,&quot; which also starred Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actress, who became known for playing high-society women, portrayed heiress Joan Dickenson opposite Paul Newman in the 1959 legal drama &quot;The Young Philadelphians.&quot; She and Newman starred together again in the 1967 Western movie &quot;Hombre.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rush played the mob boss&apos;s vengeful daughter Marian in the 1964 musical &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods,&quot; which also starred Martin, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/this-day-history-dec-25-1941-bing-crosby-performs-white-christmas-first-time&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Bing Crosby.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her time at Paramount, Rush told Fox New Digital that she befriended Hollywood legend Marilyn Monroe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh yes, we were friends,&quot; she said. &quot;We were in the studio club together. At least with me, when you first come to Hollywood, and I went to Paramount, they put me immediately in the studio club. It’s kind of like a sorority house. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/12/19/marilyn-monroe-and-photographer-milton-h-greene-knowingly-jumped-off-cliff-together-during-tumultuous-year.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Marilyn Monroe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was there. I loved her. Marilyn was such a darling lady. She was very sweet and nice. All the girls in the studio club just had a good time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in a 2019 interview with Marin magazine, Rush explained that she became weary of the Hollywood studio system after shuffling between contracts with Paramount, Universal and 20th Century Fox. She decided to venture into television and landed the role of the evil Nora Clavicle in the hit series &quot;Batman&quot; in 1968.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show, which featured Adam West as the Caped Crusader and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/08/09/burt-ward-was-offered-dustin-hoffmans-role-in-graduate.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Burt Ward&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as his sidekick Robin, aired from 1966 until 1968.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rush told Fox News Digital that at the time, no one thought that &quot;Batman&quot; would have such a lasting impact on television history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh... when you’re an actress, you don’t think about things like that,&quot; said Rush. &quot;You just think, ‘I have a job!’ You just don’t project what your future is going to be. And [Nora Clavicle] was just so funny. I just love comedy and she was very light-hearted. She was a kick.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After starring in &quot;Batman,&quot; the actress went on to play Marsha Russell in the popular soap opera &quot;Peyton Place,&quot; starring in 75 episodes between 1968 and 1969. She later starred in the long-running ABC soap opera &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/longest-running-tv-shows&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;All My Children&quot; &lt;/a&gt;for 38 episodes from 1992 to 1994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to her film and television work, Rush also continued to act on the stage. She was awarded the prestigious Sarah Siddons Award for her lead performance in the Chicago theatrical production of &quot;40 Carats.&quot; In 1984, Rush starred in the one-woman Broadway play &quot;A Woman of Independent Means.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rush was a member of the national touring company for the stage production of &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; in 1989, playing the role of M&apos;Lynn Eatonton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rush&apos;s other film credits included &quot;Flight to Hong Kong,&quot; &quot;Oh Men! Oh Women!,&quot; &quot;No Down Payment,&quot; &quot;Harry Black and the Tiger,&quot; &quot;The Bramble Bush,&quot; &quot;Strangers When We Meet,&quot; &quot;Come Blow Your Horn,&quot; &quot;The Man, &quot;Superdad,&quot; and &quot;Can&apos;t Stop the Music.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

Her final film performance was in the 2017 short &quot;Bleeding Hearts: The Arteries of Glenda Bryant,&quot; in which she starred alongside her niece Carolyn Henessy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Denver, Colorado on Jan. 4, 1927, Rush graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1948.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1950 to 1955, she was married to the late actor Jeffrey Hunter, with whom she shared son Christopher. Rush married the late publicist Warren Cowan in 1959, but they divorced in 1969. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former couple shared their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/c/claudia-cowan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;daughter Claudia.&lt;/a&gt; Rush and sculptor Jim Gruzalski tied the knot in 1970 but divorced in 1973.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Rush&apos;s 97th birthday, Claudia shared a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C1qZY5MMthl/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;touching tribute&lt;/a&gt; to her mother. Alongside a photo of herself with the actress, Claudia wrote, &quot;She is golden, she is a diamond, she glows like the moon and shines like the sun. Age does not diminish the light in her eyes, the sweetness of her heart.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To me, she is 97 years young.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Stephanie Nolasco contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Biden&apos;s Transgender Day of Visibility proclamation on Easter is &apos;a thumb in the face of Christians&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>‘The Big Weekend Show’ discuss how President Biden declaring Easter as Transgender Day of Visibility is a &amp;apos;clear&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;coordinated effort&amp;apos; to remove God from society.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;‘The Big Weekend Show’ co-hosts discuss how President Biden and his White House sparked outrage across the nation this Easter by making a proclamation for Transgender Day of Visibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s a random day created by a random person out of Michigan. No president has even marked it as any, you know, any sort of proclamation until 2021. They could have observed it on any other day. Biden chose to observe it on Easter. I think it was with intention. It&apos;s a thumb in the face of Christians and Easter,&quot; co-host Lisa Booth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On X, formerly known as Twitter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;President Biden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wrote, &quot;On Transgender Day of Visibility, we celebrate the joy, strength, and absolute courage of some of the bravest people I know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-demands-biden-issue-apology-over-blasphemous-trans-visibility-day-easter-sunday-appalling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP DEMANDS BIDEN ISSUE APOLOGY OVER &apos;BLASPHEMOUS&apos; TRANS VISIBILITY DAY ON EASTER SUNDAY: &apos;APPALLING&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, also issued a statement, saying &quot;On this day, the United States recognizes the achievements and progress that trans persons have made in the global struggle for equality and reaffirms its commitment to supporting the equality, inclusion and full recognition of the human rights of transgender persons.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;White House spokesperson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Andrew Bates issued a statement in response to the backlash to the President’s tweet, saying, &quot;As a Christian who celebrates Easter with family, President Biden stands for bringing people together and upholding the dignity and freedoms of every American. Sadly, it&apos;s unsurprising politicians are seeking to divide and weaken our country with cruel, hateful and dishonest rhetoric. President Biden will never abuse his faith for political purposes or for profit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/religious-themed-designs-banned-white-house-easter-egg-art-contest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;RELIGIOUS-THEMED DESIGNS BANNED FROM WHITE HOUSE EASTER EGG ART CONTEST&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Booth added, &quot;This is a clear effort and a coordinated effort to remove God from our society and to replace God with false gods, and in this instance, it&apos;s the trans community. They clearly want us to bow at the altar of the trans community instead of bow to God, and even if you don&apos;t believe in God, you should want to live in a society that does, because what God does in society means that we are accountable to something greater than ourselves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As human beings, we&apos;re imperfect, we&apos;re fallible. We&apos;re sinful. We&apos;re all these bad things. The Founding Fathers knew that, which is why they try to protect us from ourselves in the way they devised our government,&quot; she continued. &quot;They try to protect us from our worst impulses as a society, and a society that&apos;s devoid of God has no boundaries. There is no wrong versus right. It is a selfish society, an inward facing society, the kind of society right now that we have. A society where we have drag queens twerking for kids, where we&apos;re mutilating the bodies of young people in the name of transgenderism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-host &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/w/david-webb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;David Webb&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said Biden&apos;s move is part of a strategy for the progressive base. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;It is a blindness, and it is also part of a strategy to not only take religion and play to their hard left, progressive base, out of the conversation and out of society and the new God that is government, but it&apos;s also an attempt to gaslight the American people to get that reaction while they play to a very small base of people who may go along with this. The majority of Americans come from a Christian spirituality, a Judeo-Christian background, Hellenic values, and we believe that that is the foundation of a good society,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/pro-palestinian-protesters-interrupt-easter-vigil-service-st-patricks-cathedral-nyc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS INTERRUPT EASTER VIGIL SERVICE AT ST. PATRICK&apos;S CATHEDRAL IN NYC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not everybody gets a day. He&apos;s turned Easter into a trans celebration in his tweets and comments, I just don&apos;t understand it,&quot; co-host Joey Jones said. &quot;I think it&apos;s a bait to get an opportunity to paint anyone who disagrees as hateful, as spiteful and resentful. I don&apos;t feel any of those things towards people that are transgender. I just have a special place in my heart for Easter Sunday, and I don&apos;t think that&apos;s a whole lot to ask for. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s hateful at all, and I don&apos;t think that everyone gets a day. I think that that&apos;s part of the problem is this idea that we&apos;ve gone from acceptance to adherence, and that&apos;s not what this country is built on.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>An investigation in underway after a trailer full of Bibles was intentionally set on fire in front of a church in Tennessee early on Easter Sunday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Authorities &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in a Tennessee community&lt;/a&gt; are investigating after a trailer full of Bibles was intentionally set on fire in front of a church on Easter Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 6 a.m. on Sunday, the Mount Juliet Police Department and Fire Department swiftly responded to a trailer fire located in an intersection that was blocking the entrance of the Global Vision Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The church&apos;s pastor, Greg Locke, said in a statement posted on Facebook, that the church&apos;s security cameras were able to capture a man reportedly dropping off the trailer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;before setting it ablaze.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was a lady that had driven through the night to get to our church, and she was in the parking lot and was able to get the police officers here quickly, but it was quite the scene to wake up to on my first morning back from Israel,&quot; Pastor Locke wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/rhode-island-man-charged-setting-fires-majority-black-church&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RHODE ISLAND MAN CHARGED WITH SETTING FIRES AROUND MAJORITY-BLACK CHURCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wilson County Sheriff&apos;s Office also issued a statement saying they believe the fire was set intentionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds took to social media &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/religion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to show their support for the church,&lt;/a&gt; that was able to proceed without having any Easter services interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The evil out there is frightening. So thankful no one was harmed or damage done to the church. May our Lord touch the heart of the person who did this,&quot; one user wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/fire-destroys-los-angeles-church-hours-christmas-toy-drive-event&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRE DESTROYS LOS ANGELES CHURCH HOURS BEFORE CHRISTMAS TOY DRIVE EVENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gods got the next move. Jesus is alive and doing mighty things. Prayers for that man and also for the church. Onward Christain Soldiers,&quot; another user wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wow... the enemy is stirred and knows his time is limited. We shall not be shaken!&quot; one comment read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wilson County Sheriff&apos;s Office said it is not known at this time if the fire was aimed at the church or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/atlanta-woman-arrested-after-attempted-arson-martin-luther-king-jrs-birth-home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATLANTA WOMAN ARRESTED AFTER ATTEMPTED ARSON OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.&apos;S BIRTH HOME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To uphold the integrity of the ongoing investigation, other specific details cannot be provided at this time. However, we assure the community that further updates will be shared at the appropriate juncture,&quot; the sheriff&apos;s office stated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No injuries have been reported following the incident, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who may have additional information and/or camera footage is urged to contact the Wilson County Sheriff’s Office at 615-444-1459.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An Israeli tech couple were reportedly killed in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;plane crash&lt;/a&gt; near the California-Nevada border Saturday evening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-couple-dies-in-small-airplane-crash-in-california/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Israeli media&lt;/a&gt; identified the couple as Liron and Naomi Petrushka. Liron Petrushka was a former soccer player for the Hapoel Ramat Gan Givatayim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the late 1990s, Liron Petrushka started a successful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/tech&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;tech company&lt;/a&gt; with his wife which later sold for $242 million. In recent years the couple had been involved in various tech initiatives and living in California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Truckee Tahoe Airport says a single engine TBM aircraft N960LP crashed in Truckee, California while attempting to land at the airport. Per FlightAware, the plane had departed from Centennial airport in Denver, Colorado earlier in the afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/nashville-plane-crash-audio-recordings-reveal-pilots-final-moments-3-children-identified-among-dead&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NASHVILLE PLANE CRASH: AUDIO RECORDINGS REVEAL PILOT&apos;S FINAL MOMENTS AS 3 CHILDREN IDENTIFIED AMONG DEAD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local outlet &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kcra.com/article/truckee-plane-crash-march-2024/60350140&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;KCRA-TV reports&lt;/a&gt; there was moderate snow with visibility of a half-mile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple law enforcement agencies were on the scene. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are devastated by the news of Liron and Naomi Petrushka’s tragic death,&quot; wrote UpWest, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm which Liron Petrushka joined in 2017, on social media. &quot;Our hearts are with the Petrushka family and their sons David, Scott, and Jordan.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hapoel Ramat Gan Givatayim told the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-couple-dies-in-small-airplane-crash-in-california/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Times of Israel&lt;/a&gt; the club &quot;bows its head for the death of Liron Petrushka and his wife.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Liron grew up in the club from the age of 10 and passed through all the teams in the club, including the adults’ team,&quot; team said. &quot;He played with me in the youth team, where we won the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/soccer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;national championship&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in the adult team.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truckee is about 30 miles southwest of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/nevada&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Reno, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Illegal migrants accused in border stampede released by El Paso judge on Easter Sunday: report</title>
                    
                    <description>A judge in El Paso has ordered the release of the illegal migrants charged with overrunning Texas National Guard soldiers at Gate 36 on March 21.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On Easter Sunday, an El Paso judge ordered the release of illegal migrants accused of involvement in a &quot;border riot&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/search?q=border%20security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;when a stampede overwhelmed National Guard troops&lt;/a&gt; along the Rio Grande in March, the El Paso Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court officials also said that undocumented migrants will stay jailed if there is a federal immigration hold blocking their release, the El Paso Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Humberto Acosta made his ruling on Sunday, March 31, during an online teleconference bond hearing in which he accused the El Paso District Attorney&apos;s Office of not being ready to proceed with detention hearings for each defendant, according to the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is the ruling of the court that all the rioting participation cases will be released on their own recognizance,&quot; Acosta ordered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/speaker-johnson-meets-gov-abbott-texas-talk-border-action-mayorkas-impeachment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPEAKER JOHNSON MEETS GOV ABBOTT IN TEXAS TO TALK BORDER ACTION, MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hearing for more defendants is expected on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The riot happened on March 21 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;when a group of more than 100 migrants attempted&lt;/a&gt; to enter the U.S. illegally by rushing a border fence in an area of the southern border in El Paso, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video footage published by the New York Post shows dozens of adult men ripping away razor wire that had been set up by the state and charging past Texas National Guard personnel. They then ran toward a section of border wall, where they were blocked from entering further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unknown how many illegal migrants were booked on a charge of &quot;riot participation,&quot; but the El Paso Times reported that Acosta mentioned &quot;hundreds of arrestees&quot; were entitled to individual detention hearings within 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also unclear if the judge&apos;s ruling applied only to the &quot;riot participation&quot; charge and not to assault and criminal mischief charges related to the border stampede.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So, if the DA’s office is telling me that they are not ready to go, what we’re going to do is we’re going to release all these individuals on their own recognizance,&quot; Acosta said at the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/illegal-immigrants-storm-us-border-el-paso-knock-over-guards-amid-standoff-over-texas-law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBP INCREASES PATROLS AFTER MIGRANT SURGE OVERWHELMS TEXAS NATIONAL GUARD IN EL PASO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, previously told Fox News Digital that agents were going through video to see who assaulted the Guardsmen. They will be processed for deportation but maintain the ability to claim asylum. Texas also has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ability to charge the migrants&lt;/a&gt; who assaulted them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas has said it still has the authority to stop those coming across illegally by using trespass laws. Gov. Greg Abbott&apos;s spokesperson, Andrew Mahaleris, previously told Fox News Digital, &quot;The surge today (Thursday, March 21) in El Paso is the direct result of the unsustainable chaos President Biden has unleashed on the border. The Texas Military Department and the Texas Department of Public Safety quickly gained control of the situation and are working to repair the damage. These illegal immigrants committed crimes in Texas, and the Department of Public Safety is under instruction to arrest every illegal immigrant involved for committing criminal trespass and destruction of property.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court briefly allowed Texas’ anti-illegal immigration law, which allows police to arrest illegal immigrants, to go into effect despite a legal challenge from the Biden administration. The law was kicked back down to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which then blocked it again hours later as arguments proceeded on the merits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-top-ice-official-sides-texas-gov-abbott-biden-ongoing-border-battle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORMER TOP ICE OFFICIAL SIDES WITH TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT OVER BIDEN IN ONGOING BORDER BATTLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has said the law interferes with federal responsibility over immigration enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No. 1, we are facing such dangerous situations. And No. 2, Joe Biden, through his actions, is violating the laws of the United States of America,&quot; Abbott said following the stampede.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later on Easter Sunday morning, the El Paso Times reported that two other migrants, including a Colombian man, had separate hearings on criminal mischief charges for allegedly cutting border fencing. They were each jailed on a $2,000 bond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Bill Melugin, Adam Shaw and Michael Lee contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>NC State shocks Duke to reach Final Four as Cinderella run continues</title>
                    
                    <description>No. 11 NC State continues their Cinderella run, as they upset No. 4 Duke to reach the Final Four of the men&amp;apos;s basketball NCAA Tournament.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The team representing the state of North Carolina in the Final Four of the men’s NCAA Tournament is not the Tar Heels or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/duke-blue-devils&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Blue Devils&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/north-carolina-state-wolfpack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NC State Wolfpack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The No. 11-seeded NC State squad’s Cinderella journey continues, as they upset No. 4 Duke on Sunday night, 76-64, to move on to the Final Four in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wolfpack will take on the No. 1-seeded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/purdue-boilermakers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Purdue Boilermakers&lt;/a&gt; for a spot in the national championship game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first time NC State has reached the Final Four since 1983 when they won the national championship under legendary coach Jim Valvano. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NC State&apos;s victory came in the second half, where they outscored Duke, 55-37, after being down 27-21 at halftime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/zach-edeys-40-points-helps-purdue-take-down-tennessee-reach-final-four&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZACH EDEY&apos;S 40 POINTS HELP PURDUE TAKE DOWN TENNESSEE TO REACH FINAL FOUR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DJ Burns Jr., the Wolfpack&apos;s big man in the paint, was smiling from ear to ear in the second half as he had his way with the Blue Devils. Burns led NC State with 29 points on a highly-efficient 13-for-19 with four rebounds and three assists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guard DJ Horne was also getting the job done in the second half, using his speed to blow past the Blue Devils&apos; defense, scoring 20 points on 7-of-16 from the field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Wolfpack couldn&apos;t miss in the second half, the Blue Devils started going cold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game was tied at 38 apiece with Burns hitting a jumper with 12:22 left in the second half. But once Horne knocked down a jumper of his own to take the lead with 11:49 left, NC State didn’t let the lead slip away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NC State went on a 15-4 run, which led to a 53-42 lead with 6:56 left to play. The Wolfpack faithful in Dallas were raucous, recognizing that their team was in full control of the game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duke couldn’t buy a bucket as the half continued to tick down on the scoreboard, with leading scorer Jared McCain, who had 32 points, Jeremy Roach and Kyle Filipowski not being able to score like they had earlier in the tournament. It also didn’t help that Filipowski fouled out with less than five minutes to play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCain and Roach were able to make some layups down the stretch, but Duke’s full-court press never worked, as NC State got those points right back with easy buckets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the stat sheet, Duke shot just 32.2% from the field and 25% from three-point territory, while NC State was 46.7% from the field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filipowski fouled out with just 11 points, as he shot 3-of-12 including 0-of-3 from beyond the arc. Roach had 13 points on 5-of-13 shooting, while Tyrese Proctor went 0-of-9 which included five missed threes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NC State has a tough task ahead with Purdue, especially big man Zach Edey who dropped 40 points against Tennessee earlier on Sunday to book their Final Four ticket. But the Wolfpack continues to shock their opponents, starting with No. 6 Texas Tech and most recently No. 2 Marquette in the Sweet 16. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. 1 UConn and No. 4 Alabama are the other Final Four matchup, both of which will be played at State Farm Stadium on April 6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Nashville, Tennessee, police have released images of the suspected shooter who opened fire inside a coffee shop, killing one person, on Easter Sunday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nashville Police have identified the gunman who opened fire at a Nashville coffee shop, leaving &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/mass-shootings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;at least one person dead&lt;/a&gt; and four others injured, during Easter brunch, Nashville police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police announced that Anton Rucker, 46, who they said is a convicted felon, is being sought for the homicide at Roasted Salemtown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He has agg assault convictions in Nashville and was arrested in Murfreesboro on felony drug charges last 10/31, and on agg assault and gun charges last August,&quot; the Metro Nashville Police Department posted on X, formerly Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police said that detectives are working to determine the motive him opening fire &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;during Sunday brunch at Roasted on Garfield St., police said. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/5-wounded-detroit-club-shooting-parking-dispute&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 WOUNDED AT DETROIT CLUB IN SHOOTING OVER PARKING DISPUTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police said the shooting happened around 3 p.m. when Rucker opened fire inside the coffee shop, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;striking five people and killing one man&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was an altercation between two men at Roasted. Sunday brunch was being served. During that time period, the altercation occurred and escalated, very sharply, to one of the men pulling a gun and firing multiple shots,&quot; said Don Aaron of the Metro police at a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/jacksonville-beach-shooting-1-dead-2-hospitalized-police-looking-multiple-suspects&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JACKSONVILLE BEACH SHOOTINGS LEAVE 1 DEAD, 3 HOSPITALIZED; POLICE LOOKING FOR MULTIPLE SUSPECTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police said they believe the person with whom Rucker was having an issue was the one who was fatally shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ex-espn-star-rips-aaron-rodgers-jets-star-pushes-back-sandy-hook-conspiracy-claims&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EX-ESPN STAR RIPS AARON RODGERS AFTER JETS STAR PUSHES BACK ON SANDY HOOK CONSPIRACY CLAIMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A total of eight persons were transported from the scene,&quot; Aaron continued. He said five people were shot, one of whom died. Another person suffered a scratch and a pregnant woman went to the hospital for treatment due to a panic attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police added that this was not a shoot-out, and they have no indication that the people fighting knew each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police have released surveillance photos of Rucker and said he left the scene in a Mercedes GLS 450.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/maine-sheriff-had-probable-cause-to-detain-maine-gunman-before-mass-shooting-independent-report-claims&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAINE SHERIFF HAD PROBABLE CAUSE TO DETAIN GUNMAN BEFORE MASS SHOOTING, INDEPENDENT REPORT CLAIMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This coffee shop has not had significant issues in the past, according to authorities. Police added that this shooting was an isolated incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police department&apos;s homicide team is leading the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with information that can help police is urged to call 615-862-8600.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Samantha Daigle contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Easter bunny not just a &apos;silly, secular rabbit&apos; but way to help kids understand their faith</title>
                    
                    <description>The author of a new children&amp;apos;s book reveals the importance of bringing children closer to Christianity, their faith and the season of Easter through the use of symbols they can understand.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nothing against Peter Rabbit or his creator, British author Beatrix Potter, but he and his doppleganger the Easter bunny have nothing to do with the true meaning of Easter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither do Easter baskets, jelly beans, chocolate, bonnets, spring flowers or any other secular imagery that has taken center stage during the Lent and Easter seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of that appears to have pushed the resurrection of Jesus — the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/christianity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;cornerstone of Christianity&lt;/a&gt; — to the side or dismissed it entirely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/easter-bunny-teaches-kids-true-meaning-easter-book-faith-focus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EASTER BUNNY TEACHES KIDS TRUE MEANING OF EASTER IN NEW BOOK WITH FAITH FOCUS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you doubt that, try to recall an ad for Easter products in home decor stores that displayed a hint of the day&apos;s religious meaning.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s practically a guarantee that you will not see the phrase, &quot;The Lord is Risen!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/lifestyle-books&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a bestselling author&lt;/a&gt;, Anthony DeStefano, is fighting back. He embraced the Easter bunny for a new children&apos;s book about Jesus. DeStefano said, &quot;I was frankly tired of that silly secular rabbit hopping in and taking center stage ... on this most holy of Christian holidays.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeStefano is the author of over 25 books for adults and children. His latest book, &quot;The Story of the First Easter Bunny,&quot; is an unabashed co-opting of &quot;that silly rabbit&quot; in order to help children come back to understanding what Easter is truly about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He talked about it on a recent episode of &quot;Lighthouse Faith&quot; podcast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/easter-symbols-help-reveal-true-meaning-season-christian-writer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EASTER SYMBOLS HELP REVEAL THE TRUE MEANING OF THE SEASON, SAYS CHRISTIAN WRITER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Anyone serious about their faith would have to say that you have to use extreme caution when dealing with these kinds of secular symbols,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Parents cannot be blind to the fact that there is an ongoing culture war in our society. Our deepest beliefs are under constant and relentless attack.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/massachusetts-faith-leader-bidens-transgender-day-visibility-distraction-urges-compassion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MASSACHUSETTS FAITH LEADER SAYS BIDEN&apos;S ‘TRANSGENDER DAY OF VISIBILITY’ A ‘DISTRACTION’ YET URGES COMPASSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easter is the day that millions of Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It&apos;s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/lent-and-life&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;culmination of 40 days of Lent&lt;/a&gt;, a time of reflection and sacrifice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its conclusion is marked by Holy Week, starting with Palm Sunday, the day commemorating Jesus&apos; triumphant entry into Jerusalem and the throngs of people waving palms. But joy soon turns to sorrow as the political intrigue between the religious leaders and the itinerant rabbi turn tragic.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus is betrayed, arrested, undergoes a mock trial, and is then crucified. He dies and is buried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the third day, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/faith&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Bible says&lt;/a&gt;, God raised Him from the dead, defeating man&apos;s ultimate enemy, death itself — and bridging the chasm that existed between God and humanity since the fall from grace in the Garden of Eden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/parenting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;parents today&lt;/a&gt; is that Easter is not nearly as understandable for children as the other Christian high holy day, Christmas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Christmas has its own secular culture wars with Santa Claus, Frosty and Rudolph, the core of the story is easier for children to grasp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/holy-week-leads-faithful-easter-sunday-special-days-observed-what-they-mean&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HOLY WEEK LEADS THE FAITHFUL TO EASTER SUNDAY: HERE ARE THE SPECIAL DAYS OBSERVED AND WHAT THEY MEAN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tiny babe is born in a manger. There are angels, cuddly animals, shepherds and wise men. It&apos;s a story in which children can put themselves; after all, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/kids&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;children are closer in age&lt;/a&gt; to a baby than to a 33-year-old man, as Jesus was when he was crucified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is Easter that makes Christmas a celebration. Without Easter, there is no Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author DeStefano is no theological lightweight. His books for adults deal with the headier issues of Christianity, such as heaven, hell and the power of prayer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&apos;s also on the board of Priests For Life, a staunchly anti-abortion, pro-life nonprofit working to &quot;galvanize the clergy to preach, teach and mobilize their people more effectively in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/abortion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;effort to end abortion&lt;/a&gt; and euthanasia.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/gospel-luke-valuable-lesson-lent-says-california-pastor-forward&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;GOSPEL OF LUKE SHARES VALUABLE LESSON FOR LENT, SAYS CALIFORNIA PASTOR: &apos;LOOK FORWARD&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that traditions like the Easter bunny have cultural roots that seem harmless at first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeStefano said that in the 1700s, German Lutheran immigrants brought to America their tradition of the Easter Hare, the Osterhase or Oschter Haws. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a fabled rabbit who laid colored eggs in a nest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the custom spread across the U.S. and expanded to include chocolate, candies and gifts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baskets then replaced nests. Children even left out carrots for the bunny, much like leaving cookies and milk out for Santa Claus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/occasions/christmas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Christmas Eve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Church leaders don&apos;t rigidly oppose the more secular symbols of Easter because these can bring a little bit of extra fun to the holidays, sort of like a spice rather than the main meal, said DeStefano. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they shouldn&apos;t be a meal in and of themselves — and that&apos;s the problem today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s a larger cultural controversy, as parents lately have had to wrangle control of their rights from schools and even state officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said DeStefano, &quot;The other side ... doesn&apos;t hesitate to jump over the heads of parents to propagandize children with their, let&apos;s say, woke agenda … So children are really at the forefront of the cultural [and] religious war lines here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a colorfully illustrated book about the first Easter bunny may seem innocuous and even trivial, DeStefano said he sees a much more important role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In order to make sure that our core religious convictions are not marginalized or compromised, we have to make sure that the meaning of holidays like Easter remain in the forefront of any catechesis for children.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Story of the First Easter Bunny&quot; is published by Sophia Institute Press and can be purchased wherever books are sold, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Story-First-Easter-Bunny/dp/B0CCXHRC2R&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;including at Amazon&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Barnes &amp;amp; Noble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A Long Island roller derby league is going back at a Nassau County executive order preventing women&amp;apos;s and girls&amp;apos; teams with transgender players from using county-run facilities.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Long Island, New York&lt;/a&gt;, roller derby league is suing a county leader over an executive order that prevents women’s and girls&apos; teams with transgender players from using parks and fields that the county runs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Long Island Roller Rebels are preparing for their latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/guardians-mlb-settles-lawsuit-roller-derby-club&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;roller derby&lt;/a&gt; season at their local roller rink, but there’s a bigger battle at play right now. It’s something the league’s vice president, Amanda Urena, knew the league would want to push back on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The whole point of derby has been to be this thing where people feel welcome,&quot; Urena, who competes as &quot;Curly Fry&quot; and identifies as queer, said at a recent practice at United Skates of America in Seaford, per the Associated Press. &quot;We want trans women to know that we want you to come play with us, and we’ll do our very best to keep fighting and making sure that this is a safe space for you to play.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The league’s lawsuit, which is being backed by the New York Civil Liberties Union, comes after the February order from Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, which states sports leagues and teams looking for permits to use county-run parks must disclose whether transgender women or girls are on teams, or allowed to be in the league. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, a permit would be denied for those women’s and girls&apos; leagues, while men’s leagues won’t be affected by the order. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trans-inclusion-womens-sports-becomes-hotter-topic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRANS INCLUSION IN WOMEN&apos;S SPORTS BECOMES HOTTER TOPIC IN 2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roller Rebels were one of those teams looking for a permit for the county-owned rinks, but they are expecting to be denied. The league allows anyone who identifies as a woman, and one transgender player is already on their roster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Attorney General Letitia James has already called for Nassau County to rescind the order, saying anti-discrimination laws are being violated. Meanwhile, Blakeman has asked a federal judge to uphold the order. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roller derby has long been an inclusive sport. Margot Atwell, the author of &quot;Derby Life&quot; and roller derby player in New York City, said it’s been a safe haven for queer and trans women for decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You come in here, and you say, ‘I’m a trans woman. I’m a nonbinary person. I’m genderqueer.’ OK? We accept you,&quot; Caitlin Carroll, a member of the Roller Rebels who goes by &quot;Catastrophic Danger,&quot; said, per AP. &quot;The world is scary enough. You should have a safe place to be.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blakeman’s reasoning for the executive order stems from his effort to ensure female athletes can compete in their respective sports fairly. Blakeman held a news conference with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/j/caitlyn-jenner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Caitlyn Jenner&lt;/a&gt;, the Olympic gold medalist for the men’s decathlon in 1976 prior to a gender transition, who endorsed the ban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This issue involving trans women in women’s sports adds to the national discussion surrounding one of the most controversial topics in sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Gwyneth Paltrow&lt;/a&gt; is known for her progressive approach to relationships after coining the phrase &quot;conscious uncoupling&quot; amid her divorce with ex-husband, Chris Martin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to her status as a married woman, though, she prefers romancing just one man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an Instagram Q&amp;amp;A with followers, Paltrow revealed she&apos;s a little more conservative than assumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/gwyneth-paltrow-feels-incredible-sadness-empty-nester-youngest-child-heads-college&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GWYNETH PALTROW FEELS ‘INCREDIBLE SADNESS&apos; ABOUT BECOMING AN EMPTY NESTER AS YOUNGEST CHILD HEADS TO COLLEGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Have you ever considered a poly relationship?&quot; one user asked the Goop lifestyle brand founder. Polyamory is defined as the practice of engaging in multiple romantic relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/gwyneth-paltrow-chris-martin-lead-hollywood-divorcees-making-friends-with-exs-new-love&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GWYNETH PALTROW, CHRIS MARTIN LEAD HOLLYWOOD DIVORCEES MAKING FRIENDS WITH EXES&apos; NEW LOVES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No thanks!&quot; Paltrow responded in the &quot;Travel day AMA (Ask Me Anything) on her Instagram stories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/oscars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Academy award-winner&lt;/a&gt; added, &quot;Not for me but have no judgment. I’m a one man kinda gal.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She married TV writer and producer, Brad Falchuk, in 2018 after dating for four years. They first met on the set of &quot;Glee&quot; in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paltrow and Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, were married 10 years and have two children together, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/gwyneth-paltrow-tells-hailey-bieber-celebrity-children-work-twice-hollywood&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Apple and Moses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but announced their separation as a &quot;conscious uncoupling&quot; in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their divorce was finalized in 2016, and they’ve remained an example when it comes to friendly exes in Tinseltown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Academy Award winner proved to be cool with her ex, his girlfriend Dakota Johnson and her husband when the foursome was spotted hanging out on the beach in the Hamptons in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin also tagged along on Paltrow’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/gwyneth-paltrow-ex-husband-chris-martin-bring-modern-blended-family-to-the-maldives-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;honeymoon in the Maldives&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after she married Falchuk in September 2018, and Johnson was reportedly included on a family ski trip to Aspen, Colorado, the same year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paltrow previously discussed the &quot;love&quot; she has for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dakota-johnson-not-surprised-madame-web-reviews-probably-will-never-do-anything-like-it-again&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Madame Web&quot; actress&lt;/a&gt; in a 2020 Harper’s Bazaar interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I love her. … I can see how it would seem weird because it’s sort of unconventional. But I think, in this case, just having passed through it iteratively, I just adore her,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I always start to think of the ampersand sign — what else can you bring in, instead of being resistant to or being made insecure by? There’s so much juice in leaning into something like that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Maybe I think about relationships like that differently because I grew up in my family,&quot; Johnson told Vanity Fair in June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her parents, Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, were married briefly in 1976 and once again in 1989, before divorcing in 1996. Griffith was previously married to Steven Bauer, and the former couple has one son. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melanie was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/melanie-griffith-files-for-divorce-from-antonio-banderas-after-18-years&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;married to Antonio Banderas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 1996, before a divorce was finalized, to 2015. They also have a daughter named Stella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don, 73, has been married five times to four women, two of which were annulled within days. He tied the knot with Kelley Phleger in 1999, and they have three children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were all cool [with each other],&quot; Dakota said of her unique childhood. &quot;Obviously, there were times where it was not cool, but I experienced that, so I don’t want that in my life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>640-year-old castle with moat found under hotel: &apos;Remarkably preserved&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>French archaeologists recently discovered a medieval castle under the courtyard of a hotel in Vannes. It was built by John IV, Duke of Brittany, in the 1380s.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists recently announced the discovery of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology/history&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;14th century&lt;/a&gt; castle – complete with a moat – under a hotel in Vannes, France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The castle, which has been identified as the Château de l&apos;Hermine, was built by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/france&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;John IV&lt;/a&gt; the Conqueror in the 1380s. It is located under the courtyard of Hotel Lagorce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a March 26 press release translated from French, the National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) explained that the excavations were carried out between the spring and autumn of 2023. Archaeologists were shocked by how relatively complete and well-preserved the castle&apos;s remains were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The excavation revealed little by little the plan of the ground floor: the ducal house, 42 meters long and 17 meters wide (out of work), is endowed with walls of an exceptional thickness,&quot; INRAP said. A ducal house refers to a house inhabited by a duke, which John IV was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/ancient-shipwrecks-artifacts-dating-early-3000-bc-uncovered-underwater-researchers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANCIENT SHIPWRECKS, ARTIFACTS DATING AS EARLY AS 3000 BC UNCOVERED BY UNDERWATER RESEARCHERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Directly bordered by a moat, it is flanked to the west of what one can call a ‘square tower.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also discovered &quot;several&quot; staircases, one of which was &quot;a remarkably preserved staircase, with a decorated core and three steps.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, excavators found dozens of objects &quot;related to the daily life of the castle,&quot; including coins, cooking dishes and jewelry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/man-reveals-ancient-coins-found-church-60-years-ago-just-children-on-a-treasure-hunt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MAN REVEALS ANCIENT COINS HE FOUND UNDER CHURCH 60 YEARS AGO: &apos;JUST CHILDREN ON A TREASURE HUNT&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The humidity of the area also preserved remarkable wooden items, including fragments of barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In addition, archaeologists conducted a deep survey in the moat,&quot; INRAP said. &quot;From this very wet material, they extracted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;rich furniture.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists even found tiles covered with graffiti, padlocks for furniture and pieces of clothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INRAP also said the site was incredibly well-managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The homogeneity of the materials used for the construction of the castle and the standardization of the modules show a mastery of the management of the site throughout the operating chain, from the extraction of stone to its implementation,&quot; the INRAP release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The construction… took place in a single phase, which testifies to the importance of the financial and human resources used,&quot; the statement added. &quot;The remains indicate that John IV knew how to surround himself with the best engineers and craftsmen of their time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to INRAP for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Turkey’s main opposition party made huge gains in the country’s urban areas in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/things-know-turkish-local-elections-gauge-erdogans-popularity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;local elections&lt;/a&gt; Sunday, dealing a blow to longtime President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who wanted to retake control of those areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the state-run Anadolu Agency, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-politics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Republican People’s Party&lt;/a&gt;, or CHP, won the municipalities in nearly half of Turkey’s 81 provinces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incumbent Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu of CHP, was leading by a by a wide margin in Turkey&apos;s largest city and economic hub, with more than 80% of ballot boxes counted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mansur Yavas, the mayor of the capital, Ankara, retained his seat with a stunning 25-point difference over his challenger, according to the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/polish-president-vetoes-legalization-over-the-counter-morning-after-pill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POLISH PRESIDENT VETOES LEGALIZATION OF OVER-THE-COUNTER MORNING AFTER PILL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, the CHP gained 37% of the votes nationwide, compared to 36% for the president&apos;s party, marking the CHP&apos;s greatest electoral victory since Erdogan came to power two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vote was a key test of Erdogan&apos;s popularity as he sought to win back control of key urban the opposition won in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/a-look-at-sundays-local-elections-in-turkey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;elections five years ago&lt;/a&gt;. The CHP&apos;s victory in Ankara and Istanbul in 2019 had shattered Erdogan&apos;s aura of invincibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main battleground for the 70-year-old Turkish president was Istanbul, a city of 16 million people where he was born and raised and where he began his political career as mayor in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result came as a boost for the opposition, which was left divided and demoralized after a defeat to Erdogan and his ruling Islamic-oriented Justice and Development Party, or AKP, in last year&apos;s presidential and parliamentary elections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Former President Trump reacted to Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador&amp;apos;s demand that the U.S. give $20 billion in annual aid to Latin America.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former President Trump joined &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/shows/one-nation-with-brian-kilmeade&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;One Nation&lt;/a&gt;&quot; host Brian Kilmeade to discuss the &quot;lack of respect&quot; foreign leaders have for President Biden and his administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an exclusive interview, the &quot;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&quot; co-host asked Trump about Mexican President &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/mexico-president-baltimore-bridge-collapse-shows-migrants-do-not-deserve-treated&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Andrés Manuel López Obrador&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; interview with CBS&apos; &quot;60 Minutes&quot; correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On ‘60 Minutes,&apos; the president of Mexico says, &apos;We&apos;re not going to shut down our border until you change your policy on Cuba and change your policy on Venezuela.&apos; Is it OK for the Mexican president to dictate American policy?&quot; Kilmeade asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump said, &quot;Well, he said much more than that. He said he wants $10 billion essentially just to talk, $10 billion to talk, and that&apos;s come out since, and no, that wouldn&apos;t happen with me, with the wall.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mexican-president-demands-20-billion-work-permits-10-million-hispanics-exchange-immigration-help&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEXICAN PRESIDENT DEMANDS $20B, WORK PERMITS FOR 10M HISPANICS IN EXCHANGE FOR IMMIGRATION HELP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What changed,&quot; Kilmeade followed up with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s very simple: lack of respect for the president. They would never say that to me. They would never say before we even talk. They want $10 billion a year, Mexico just asked for $10 billion a year. They would never ask it. I wouldn&apos;t give them 10 cents,&quot; Trump said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-says-its-putting-us-first-face-mexicos-migrant-demands&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT’S PUTTING US FIRST IN FACE OF MEXICO&apos;S MIGRANT DEMANDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview, López Obrador doubled down on his demands previously made in January to the Biden administration in exchange for support from the Mexican government to halt the surge of illegal migrants, among them: lifting sanctions on Cuba and Venezuela; sending Latin American and Caribbean countries $20 billion in aid a year; and granting legal status to Mexican illegal immigrants in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mexican president said the &quot;flow of migrants will continue&quot; unless the U.S. meets his demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-sends-message-biden-obama-missing-nypd-officer-wake-go-whether-like&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trump concluded the interview&lt;/a&gt; with Kilmeade by saying, &quot;The most important day in the history of our country is going to be November 5th. Our country is going bad, and it&apos;s going to be changed on November 5th, and if it&apos;s not changed, we&apos;re not going to have a country anymore.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>New Marvin Gaye music resurfaces in Belgium 40 years after his death: ‘as good’ as ‘Sexual Healing’</title>
                    
                    <description>New music from the late Marvin Gaye has been uncovered in Belgium, after being left at the home of the &amp;quot;Let&amp;apos;s Get It On&amp;quot; singer&amp;apos;s friend for over 40 years.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This year marks the 40th anniversary of the tragic death of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rolling-stone-best-500-albums-list-marvin-gaye-top-honor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Marvin Gaye,&lt;/a&gt; but as his legacy lives on, so may an opportunity to hear previously unreleased music from the singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the BBC, Gaye left a collection of stage costumes, notebooks, and audio tapes with Charles Dumolin, a Belgian musician who hosted Gaye at his home in Ostend in the early 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belgian lawyer Alex Trappeniers, a business partner of the family, told the BBC &quot;We can open a time capsule here and share the music of Marvin with the world. It&apos;s very clear. He&apos;s very present.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trappeniers cataloged the audio recordings, explaining, &quot;Each time a new instrumental started when Marvin started singing, I gave it a number. At the end when I had listened to all the 30 tapes I had 66 demos of new songs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jane-fonda-regrets-not-sleeping-with-marvin-gaye&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JANE FONDA REVEALS SHE HAS ‘GREAT REGRET’ ABOUT NOT SLEEPING WITH MARVIN GAYE: ‘I WAS MARRIED’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, &quot;A few of them are complete and a few of them are as good as ‘Sexual Healing,’ because it was made in the same time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One song in particular stuck with Trappeniers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was one song that when I listened to it for ten seconds I found the music was in my head all day, the words were in my head all day, like a moment of planetary alignment,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question of ownership not only of the physical items but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/musicians-support-ed-sheeran-copyright-trial-win-marvin-gaye-song-lawsuit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the intellectual rights&lt;/a&gt; is already heating up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Trappeniers, &quot;They belong to [the family] because they were left in Belgium 42 years ago. Marvin gave it to them and said, &apos;Do whatever you want with it&apos; and he never came back. That&apos;s important.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dumolin passed in 2019, and under Belgian law, according to the BBC, there is a stipulation that any property, including stolen property, absolutely belongs to a person after 30 years, meaning per the country’s laws, Dumolin’s family owns them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that doesn’t apply to intellectual property, meaning he and the Dumolin family couldn’t legally release the music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to Gaye’s estate, but they did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/beatles-releasing-final-song-now-and-then-john-lennon-vocals-quite-emotional-paul-mccartney&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEATLES RELEASING FINAL SONG &apos;NOW AND THEN&apos; WITH JOHN LENNON VOCALS: &apos;QUITE EMOTIONAL,&apos; SAYS PAUL MCCARTNEY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trappeniers believes a compromise could be reached between Gaye’s family and he and his associates to release the music for the world to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think we both benefit, the family of Marvin and the collection in the hands of [Dumolin&apos;s heirs]. If we put our hands together and find the right people in the world, the Mark Ronsons or the Bruno Mars.... I&apos;m not here to make suggestions but to say OK, let&apos;s listen to this and let&apos;s make the next album,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also addressed the complicated moral and legal situation both parties are embroiled in, noting that the Dumolin family could simply sell the collection if they chose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Morally, I&apos;d like to work with the family but this is the nightmare for them... that someone comes from a country where there&apos;s a lot of money and we make an agreement and this collection leaves this country,&quot; he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaye was dubbed the &quot;Prince of Motown&quot; and the &quot;Prince of Soul,&quot;  for his behind the scenes work on the label’s distinctive sound before breaking away from the company and forging his own career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was known for hist like &quot;Sexual Healing,&quot; &quot;What’s Going On?,&quot; and &quot;Let’s Get It On,&quot; as well as his overall influence on the R&amp;amp;B genre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 1, 1984, the day before his 45th birthday, Gaye’s father, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/this-day-in-history-april-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Marvin Gaye Sr., shot and killed&lt;/a&gt; his son during an argument. Gaye Sr. pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and received probation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaye’s music has been the center of two major legal disputes in the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke were ordered to pay $5 million to Gaye’s family after a federal judge ruled their 2013 hit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/pharrell-williams-and-robin-thicke-to-marvin-gayes-family-5-million-for-copyright-infringement-california-judge-rules&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Blurred Lines&quot;&lt;/a&gt; was similar to Gaye’s single, &quot;Got to Give It Up.&quot; Per the ruling, Gaye’s family will also receive 50 percent of &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; royalties in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Ed Sheeran won a court battle after a jury found the singer didn’t copy Gaye’s single &quot;Let’s Get It On&quot; in his 2014 hit &quot;Thinking Out Loud.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Fishing enthusiast Hunter Ham recently captured footage of an alligator on a Texas beach eating a bull redfish. Gators are primarily freshwater creatures.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A beachgoer recently captured the moment an alligator chomped away at a fish at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Texas beach.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunter Ham told TMX that he spotted the gator at Sea Rim State Park near Sabine Pass, which is not far from the border of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/louisiana&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; and Texas. He was driving by a beach with his wife and three children when he noticed the reptile on Mar. 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were driving out, about 150 yards from where we played on the beach when we saw it,&quot; Ham recounted. &quot;You could tell, this was ‘his beach’ and he was chilling without a care in the world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video shows the alligator standing on the beach while eating a bull redfish. Ham said that he could tell the type of fish from its length, eyes and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/11-foot-long-king-arthur-alligator-spotted-at-south-carolina-golf-resort-mysterious-head-piece&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11-FOOT-LONG &apos;KING ARTHUR&apos; THE ALLIGATOR SPOTTED AT SOUTH CAROLINA GOLF RESORT WITH MYSTERIOUS HEAD PIECE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That is a brute,&quot; he was heard saying on video. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While alligators are primarily freshwater reptiles, Ham said that the animal likely walked over from a nearby source of freshwater &quot;to finish his meal and bathe in the sun.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-officers-question-alligator-hiding-under-car-suspicious-character&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FLORIDA OFFICERS &apos;QUESTION&apos; ALLIGATOR HIDING UNDER CAR: &apos;A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[Texas Parks and Wildlife] explained that gators will sometimes come into the saltwater, briefly, to rid themselves of parasites,&quot; he explained. &quot;This chill dude had no fears for us. What a beautiful creature, at a distance. What a treat!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There have always been gators around the area and the beach, it&apos;s just rare that we got it on film this day. He was just catching some rays and probably going to wash off the parasites. Seemed like a chill gator when given space.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fishing enthusiast added that the beach holds a special meaning to him, as he&apos;s visited it many times before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our beaches are brown and the waves are generally flat, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;we&apos;re blessed&lt;/a&gt; to live here,&quot; Ham acknowledged. &quot;I learned the mystical art of surfing without waves here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to Ham for additional comment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Zach Edey&apos;s 40 points help Purdue take down Tennessee to reach Final Four</title>
                    
                    <description>Zach Edey dropped 40 points with 16 rebounds to lead the Purdue Boilermakers to a 72-66 win over Tennessee to reach the Final Four. The Volunteers&amp;apos; Dalton Knecht had 37 points.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The top-seeded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/purdue-boilermakers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Purdue Boilermakers&lt;/a&gt; are heading to the Final Four as Zach Edey’s 40 points helped his squad take down No. 2 Tennessee on Sunday afternoon, 72-66. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stars for each team were on full display in this Elite Eight contest as Edey and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/tennessee-volunteers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Volunteers’&lt;/a&gt; Dalton Knecht traded buckets throughout the game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while Knecht had 37 points on 14-of-31 shooting, including 6 of 12 from three-point territory, Edey’s 40 points on 12-of-21 shooting and 14 of 22 from the free throw line, outlasted him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edey’s free throw with 4:42 left in the game made it 59-58, and he continued to get clutch buckets from there, including two more free throws to put the Boilermakers up three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Knecht was trying his hardest to retake the lead with free throws of his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Edey dunk made it 63-60&lt;/a&gt;, Purdue’s Lance Jones, who had just seven points in the game, hit his only three-pointer of the game with 2:43 left to make it a six-point game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lsus-kim-mulkey-shreds-la-times-column-describing-players-dirty-debutantes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LSU&apos;S KIM MULKEY SHREDS LA TIMES OVER COLUMN DESCRIBING PLAYERS AS ‘DIRTY DEBUTANTES’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the bucket Purdue needed to pull away from Tennessee, and they held it as the clock reached zero. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the stat sheet, Edey also had a double-double, as he usually does, with 16 rebounds. He had one steal, one assist and one block as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purdue also saw Fletcher Loyer score 14 points with four assists and three rebounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Knecht’s 31 shots made up half of Tennessee’s attempts, the rest of the Volunteers struggled from the field. Zakai Zeigler was just 3-for-12 for nine points with eight assists and four rebounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a team, Tennessee shot 38.7% while Purdue was 45.3% accurate from the field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After last season’s shocker in the first round against Farleigh Dickinson University, who defeated the No. 1-seeded Boilermakers as a No. 16 seed, Purdue has taken down their opponents forcefully with double-digit victories in the three prior to this matchup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Purdue awaits the winner of No. 4 Duke and No. 11 NC State to find out who will be their Final Four opponent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Florida car chase in 2020 may be linked to Havana syndrome: report</title>
                    
                    <description>A high-speed chase in Key West, Florida, may be linked to the mysterious phenomenon known as &amp;quot;Havana syndrome,&amp;quot; according to a new report set to air Sunday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A high-speed chase in Florida may be linked to the mysterious phenomenon known as &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/advanced-tests-find-no-brain-injuries-us-diplomats-havana-syndrome-symptoms&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Havana syndrome&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; according to a new report.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. and Canadian embassy staff first reported the condition in Cuba in 2016, and it was later reported by hundreds of American personnel in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;multiple countries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/video/connection-revealed-between-havana-syndrome-speeding-mustang-in-florida/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;promotional clip&lt;/a&gt; of a story from CBS News’ &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; set to air later Sunday, shows bodycam footage of police chasing a car down a highway in Key West in June 2020. The chase goes on for 15 miles, with the driver topping speeds of 110 mph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, he’s pulled over and apprehended. Inside the man’s car, officers found bank account notes and a device resembling a walkie-talkie that can erase a car’s computer data, including its GPS history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officers also found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Russian passport&lt;/a&gt;. The suspect gives his name as &quot;Vitalii&quot; and says he is from St. Petersburg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked why he fled from police officers, he repeatedly says, &quot;I don’t know.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report comes weeks after the release of a nearly five-year study from the National Institutes of Health, which found no explanation for the mysterious health problems – including headaches, balance problems and difficulties with thinking and sleep – that have been reported by U.S. diplomats and other government employees. The NIH conducted an array of advanced tests but found no brain injuries or degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-suggests-regime-change-communist-cuba-economy-worsens&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP SUGGESTS REGIME CHANGE IN COMMUNIST CUBA AS ECONOMY WORSENS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NIH did appear to contradict some earlier findings that raised the specter of brain injuries in people experiencing what the State Department now calls &quot;anomalous health incidents.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophisticated MRI scans detected no significant differences in brain volume, structure or white matter — signs of injury or degeneration — when Havana syndrome patients were compared to healthy government workers with similar jobs, including some in the same embassy. Nor were there significant differences in cognitive and other tests, according to findings published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that couldn&apos;t rule out some transient injury when symptoms began, researchers said that was good news that they couldn&apos;t spot long-term markers on brain scans that are typical after trauma or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday’s report is the latest episode in an ongoing saga to unravel a mystery that began when personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba began seeking medical care for hearing loss and ear-ringing after reporting sudden weird noises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early on, there was concern that Russia or another country may have used some form of directed energy to attack Americans. But last year, U.S. intelligence agencies said there was no sign a foreign adversary was involved and that most cases appeared to have different causes, from undiagnosed illnesses to environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NIH study, which began in 2018 and included more than 80 Havana syndrome patients, wasn&apos;t designed to examine the likelihood of some weapon or other trigger for Havana syndrome symptoms. Chan said the findings don&apos;t contradict the intelligence agencies&apos; conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
