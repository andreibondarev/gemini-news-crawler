                    <description>NYPD are searching for the suspect who is accused of punching actor Steve Buscemi in the face in New York City on Wednesday, according to local media outlets.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Actor Steve Buscemi was randomly assaulted while walking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;streets of New York&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, his publicist confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Steve Buscemi was assaulted in Mid-Town Manhattan, another victim of a random act of violence in the city. He is ok and appreciates everyone’s well wishes, though incredibly sad for everyone that this has happened to while also walking the streets of NY,&quot; Buscemi&apos;s publicist told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 66-year-old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;star of &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;&lt;/a&gt; was assaulted just before noon in midtown Manhattan and taken to a nearby hospital with bruising, swelling and bleeding to his left eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His attacker reportedly took off and has yet to be captured, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2024/05/12/us-news/boardwalk-empire-star-steve-buscemi-attacked-by-rock-wielding-maniac-in-nyc/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;the New York Post.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/marvel-actor-michael-stuhlbarg-assaulted-nyc-homeless-man-rock&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARVEL ACTOR MICHAEL STUHLBARG ASSAULTED IN NYC BY HOMELESS MAN WITH A ROCK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Police Department issued a statement on the assault on Wednesday, not naming Buscemi as the victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NYPD released surveillance photos of the alleged attacker who was last seen wearing a baseball hat, blue t-shirt, black sweatpants, and white sneakers. The photos also showed the bearded man carrying a backpack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His attacker has yet to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I saw he was with a woman, and then through the corner of the window I saw him trip and fall backwards,&quot; a worker in the area who witnessed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;part of the assault&lt;/a&gt; told The New York Post. &quot;He right away got up and ran in the opposite direction. I didn’t see who hit him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/angie-harmon-accuses-instacart-delivery-driver-shooting-killing-dog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANGIE HARMON ACCUSES INSTACART DELIVERY DRIVER OF SHOOTING AND KILLING HER DOG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buscemi, who was born in Brooklyn, is a beloved New York figure and is a former New York firefighter who helped his old team at Ground Zero during the 9/11 attacks of the World Trade Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back on March 31, Buscemi&apos;s &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;co-star Michael Stuhlbarg&lt;/a&gt; was hit in the back of the neck with a rock while walking in Manhattan&apos;s Central Park. Stuhlbarg was able to chase down his attacker, who was taken into custody outside the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His attacker was a homeless man, later identified as 27-year-old Xavier Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the NYPD for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>An Arizona woman has accepted a lesser sentence to three years probation after pleading guilty to attempting to poison her husband’s coffee every day for months.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/arizona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;An Arizona woman&lt;/a&gt; who admitted to poisoning her Air Force husband by pouring bleach into his coffee is reportedly avoiding jail time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melody Felicano Johnson, 40, pleaded guilty last month to two counts of poisoning food or drink for putting trace amounts of bleach into husband Roby Johnson’s coffee maker on July 11 and July 18, 2023, Arizona&apos;s 13 News reported.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson was sentenced to a probation sentence that includes mandatory mental health treatment that goes into effect immediately, and she is not allowed to have contact with her husband unless a legal team is present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roby Johnson said he believed his wife was trying to kill him to collect death benefits, according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/arizona-woman-pleads-guilty-poisoning-air-force-husbands-coffee-bleach&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARIZONA WOMAN PLEADS GUILTY TO POISONING AIR FORCE HUSBAND&apos;S COFFEE WITH BLEACH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was initially arrested and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;charged with attempted first-degree murder,&lt;/a&gt; aggravated assault and adding harmful substances to food, drink or medicine but agreed to a plea deal instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple have a child together and were going through a divorce during the times she tried to poison her husband, court documents show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/colorado-dentist-accused-poisoning-wife-tried-get-fellow-inmate-plant-fake-suicide-notes-police&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLORADO DENTIST ACCUSED OF POISONING WIFE TRIED TO GET FELLOW INMATE TO PLANT FAKE SUICIDE NOTES: POLICE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roby began to notice his coffee tasted odd while he was drinking a cup in March 2023 when the family was stationed in Germany. He drank the coffee for two or three weeks before purchasing pool testing strips to determine what was wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, he tested the tap water, which came back normal, but after conducting the test on his coffee, he discovered the drink contained high levels of chlorine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stated she knew that he would prep his coffee pot to be ready at night so that in the morning he just needed to turn it on to make his coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/former-titans-scout-accused-killing-pregnant-girlfriend-released-jail-2-5m-bond&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORMER TITANS SCOUT ACCUSED OF KILLING PREGNANT GIRLFRIEND RELEASED FROM JAIL ON $2.5M BOND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roby pretended to drink the coffee while stationed in Germany and waited until the family moved back to Tucson, Arizona, last summer to alert authorities because he did not want to report his findings in Europe, the court documents state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the family returned to the U.S. in late June, Roby set up a camera inside their temporary housing near &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/air-force&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Davis Monthan Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; to observe his wife&apos;s behavior – and the camera allegedly captured Melody pouring bleach into his coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 6, he filed a report with the Tucson Police Department, but police did not follow up because the video did not clearly show what liquid his wife was pouring into his drink, prompting Roby to set up a second camera disguised as a fire alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roby returned to the police department on July 18 to provide additional video evidence, and the new footage allegedly showed his wife pouring bleach into the coffee machine before brewing. Johnson was then detained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital’s Michael Dorgan and Landon Mion contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fifteen people were injured and three killed in a shooting at a large spring-themed event in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/alabama&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Stockton, Alabama,&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, police say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Baldwin County Sheriff’s Office announced the injuries and fatalities in a Facebook post on Sunday evening. Authorities explained that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/mass-shootings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;mass shooting&lt;/a&gt; began at around 9:30 p.m. at a field on Upper Bryants Landing Road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our preliminary investigation has revealed that local residents hosted a May Day event yesterday in an open field on Upper Bryant&apos;s [sic] Landing Road,&quot; the post read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities say that the event, which had around 1,000 attendants, was peaceful &quot;until an argument took place.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/3-atlanta-police-officers-wounded-shooting-suspect-dead&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 ATLANTA POLICE OFFICERS WOUNDED IN SHOOTING, SUSPECT DEAD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[The argument] led to at least one subject shooting multiple rounds into the large crowd,&quot; officials explained. &quot;A total of eighteen people were shot during this incident. Unfortunately, three of the victims succumbed to their wounds.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities are actively searching for suspects. They believe multiple gunmen were involved and &quot;are following up on those leads,&quot; police say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/memphis-police-fatally-shoot-armed-suspect-domestic-disturbance-injured-man&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MEMPHIS POLICE FATALLY SHOOT ARMED SUSPECT IN DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE THAT INJURED MAN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a tragic event that touches many lives in our community,&quot; the sheriff&apos;s office added in its statement. &quot;We are working very hard to bring this case to a resolution, but we cannot make arrests or successfully prosecute the offenders without help.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Baldwin County Sheriff’s Office is asking for the public&apos;s help while they investigate this incident. Anyone with information about the case is asked to contact police at 251-972-8589, option 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the Baldwin County Sheriff’s Office for more information, but has not heard back.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A manhunt has ended in Ohio for the suspect who killed a military veteran, who was part of the Euclid Police Department for less than a year, during an ambush on Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to WJW, just before 10 p.m. on Saturday, Euclid police officer Jacob Derbin, 23, was killed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;when a gunman ambushed&lt;/a&gt; him during a disturbance call to a residence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derbin was taken to a local hospital, but succumbed to his injuries, WJW reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspect, who Euclid Police have identified as Deshawn Anthony Vaughn, 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/utah-police-officer-killed-semi-truck-suspect-arrested-hours-long-manhunt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UTAH POLICE OFFICER KILLED BY SEMI-TRUCK, SUSPECT ARRESTED AFTER HOURS-LONG MANHUNT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple law enforcement agencies were assisting the Euclid Police Department in locating Vaughn, who was described as being around 6&apos;3, 215 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police believe Vaughn, who is a convicted felon and was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;wanted for violating conditions&lt;/a&gt; of his community supervision, fled the scene following the fatal shooting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday evening, WJW reported that the manhunt for Vaughn was over as he had been found deceased inside a residence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police told WJW he was heavily armed, and it is not yet clear how he died, but an investigation is ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Euclid Police Chief Scott Meyer told WJW that Derbin was an &quot;incredible&quot; person and that the entire department was &quot;devastated.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was an amazing human being. Just a great heart. Had an incredible smile. The world’s a better place with him in it,&quot; Meyer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/charlotte-police-chief-breaks-down-remembering-slain-officers-says-suspect-extensive-criminal-history&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHARLOTTE POLICE CHIEF BREAKS DOWN REMEMBERING 4 SLAIN OFFICERS, SAYS SUSPECT HAD &apos;EXTENSIVE&apos; CRIMINAL HISTORY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derbin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;had been an officer&lt;/a&gt; with the department for the last 10 months, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost released a statement and vowed to make sure that justice is served.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The promise to protect is signed with the blood of our officers. The killer who ambushed Officer Derbin will be found and will receive the full measure of justice,&quot; Yost wrote in a statement on X. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yost continued his post, sharing his condolences with the family of Derbin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohio Governor Mike DeWine also offered his condolences to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/ohio&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;community of Euclid.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fran and I offer our deepest condolences to Euclid Police Officer Jacob Derbin&apos;s family and his brothers and sisters at @Euclid_PD. His bravery and dedication to the Euclid community will not be forgotten,&quot; DeWine wrote in post on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/tunnel-towers-pays-mortgages-4-slain-charlotte-officers-dont-country-police&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TUNNEL TO TOWERS PAYS MORTGAGES FOR 4 SLAIN CHARLOTTE OFFICERS: &apos;DON&apos;T HAVE A COUNTRY WITHOUT POLICE&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeWine proclaimed that in honor of the life and service of Officer Derbin, all flags would be flown at half-staff on all public buildings amid grounds throughout Cuyahoga County, the Ohio Statehouse, the Vern Riffle Center, and the Rhodes State Office Tower on Sunday and will remain at half-staff until sunset on the day of his funeral. He added that all public buildings across the state of Ohio could also participate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derbin was engaged to Liv Wuebker. The couple were set to be married on July 27 in Minister, Ohio, according to their wedding page on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theknot.com/us/jacob-derbin-and-liv-wuebker-jul-2024&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;The Knot.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;An awful tragedy. We are going to miss you Jacob. Thank for serving your country in Kuwait, and continuing to serve and protect your community when you came back. Most of all, thank you for coming into our family and loving all of us. Especially Liv. You’ll always be part of our family, and forever my first brother. We will always miss you,&quot; Skylar Wuebker, who woul have become Derbin&apos;s brother-in-law in just a few months, wrote in a post on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the Euclid Police Department for comment. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>&amp;apos;The Big Weekend Show&amp;apos; co-hosts discuss President Biden&amp;apos;s foreign policy record amid the Israel-Hamas war.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News contributor and Marine Corps veteran Johnny Joey Jones discusses the Biden administration&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-gop-drafting-biden-impeachment-articles-israel-aid-cutoff-threat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;approach to the Israel-Hamas war&lt;/a&gt; and its decision not to supply Israel with weapons if it invades Rafah on &quot;The Big Weekend Show.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOHNNY JOEY JONES: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;You know, Bob Gates famously put in his memoir that Joe Biden&apos;s been wrong on pretty much every defense decision the Obama administration made. So I don&apos;t know exactly how you word it more eloquently than that. He opposed &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/tech/artificial-intelligence-linked-to-bin-laden-raid-is-being-used-to-find-future-threats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;the Bin Laden raid&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; and several things that turned out to be victories, small victories for us, on our way to losing that war. And so, the reason why Bob Gates said that he has been wrong is Joe Biden is either indecisive or scared when it comes to taking action to protect our country, or now, to back our allies in any meaningful way.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-donors-rage-pledge-pause-weapon-shipments-israel-bad-bad-bad-decision&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN DONORS RAGE OVER HIS PLEDGE TO PAUSE WEAPON SHIPMENTS TO ISRAEL: ‘BAD, BAD, BAD DECISION’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I don&apos;t know the answer. I will say this. This may make some people... who may not strongly support Israel, and the antisemitism I see is disgusting, but one thing that some of these people have said that I do agree with is we learned in our war that what&apos;s happening in Gaza, no matter how justified, is creating the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/young-generation-anti-hamas-activists-gaza-step-up-to-serve-snubbed-un-aid-groups&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;next generation of Hamas&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;. But stopping them now doesn&apos;t fix that. That&apos;s already happened. At least let them win the war that they have and then have an influence on how they recover from it. Doing it now only shows division, and it doesn&apos;t do anything to win the Palestinian people back over or make them less Hamas-friendly. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;That&apos;s going to happen. It&apos;s already going to happen. They&apos;ve already bombed half of Gaza. If they bombed the other half in order to kill the rest of Hamas, you&apos;re not going to change that fact. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;So, I understand the reluctancy from that perspective. But, no, what he&apos;s doing right now is he&apos;s ensuring that people... &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-administration-pushing-avoid-israeli-invasion-rafah-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;that Hamas stays strong&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; because they think they can deter the United States and anybody else. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Hillary Clinton slammed by fellow Democrat for &apos;dismissive&apos; remarks about anti-Israel protesters</title>
                    
                    <description>Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said Hillary Clinton was &amp;quot;quite dismissive&amp;quot; when she said anti-Israel protesters &amp;quot;don&amp;apos;t know very much...about the history of the Middle East.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sen. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/maryland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.,&lt;/a&gt; accused former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of being &quot;quite dismissive of students’ concerns,&quot; when she ripped anti-Israel student protesters as being ignorant about Middle Eastern affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They don’t know very much at all about the history of the Middle East, or, frankly, about history in many areas of the world, including our own country,&quot; Clinton said earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Clinton pointed to an offer her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made to then-Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat when he was in office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They don’t know that…an offer was made to Palestinians for a state on 96% of the existing territory occupied by the Palestinians,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/the-clintons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Clinton said&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;with 4% of Israel to be given to reach 100% of the amount of territory that was hoped for.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/hillary-clinton-slams-young-anti-israel-protesters-ignorant-middle-east-dont-know-very-much&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HILLARY CLINTON SLAMS YOUNG ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS AS IGNORANT ON MIDDLE EAST: ‘THEY DON’T KNOW VERY MUCH&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Secretary of State said that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot;&gt;her claims about students&lt;/a&gt; were based on multiple conversations with young people over the past few months. Anti-Israel student protests have broken out at schools across the country following the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israel and Israel&apos;s subsequent military response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Hollen appeared on CBS’s &quot;Face the Nation&quot; on Sunday morning, where he was asked about Clinton’s remarks from earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, I thought, Margaret, that Secretary Clinton’s comments, in that regard, were quite dismissive of students’ concerns about the awful humanitarian crisis and high civilian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/middle-east&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;death toll in Gaza&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/hillary-clinton-questions-voters-disillusioned-trump-biden-race-why-hard-choice&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HILLARY CLINTON EXASPERATED AT VOTERS CONFLICTED BETWEEN BIDEN AND TRUMP: &apos;WHY IS THAT A HARD CHOICE?&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Hollen said Americans have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-protests&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;right to peacefully protest&lt;/a&gt; and that there is a need to ensure students feel safe on campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said there is a need to &quot;stamp out antisemitism and hate&quot; wherever it is seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But I believe that the great majority of the students are protesting, are following very closely what’s happening in Gaza. They see what’s a very high civilian death toll,&quot; Van Hollen said. &quot;We can certainly revisit history and past negotiations, but I believe that the overwhelming majority of students, not all, and…there are some very bad elements that are involved, as well as on the counter protest side, but I believe that the students do understand what’s happening in Gaza with respect to the civilian casualties.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/university-california-berkeley-grads-disrupt-commencement-anti-israel-protests&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-BERKELEY GRADS DISRUPT COMMENCEMENT WITH ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I strongly support the right of Americans to peacefully protest, but also the need to make sure that students feel safe on campus,&quot; Van Hollen told Fox News Digital. &quot;There is no place anywhere in America for antisemitism, hate speech, or violence of any kind.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Clinton Foundation did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hillary Clinton has faced angry students directly, including when she was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/watch-hillary-clinton-speech-repeatedly-interrupted-pro-palestinian-protesters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;shouted down&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by pro-Palestinian protesters during a speech at Columbia University in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton, you are a war criminal!&quot; a man shouted as the former Secretary of State walked onto a lecture hall stage at Columbia University in New York City. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital’s Jeffrey Clark contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Travis Kelce spotted dancing in star-studded group at Taylor Swift&apos;s Paris show</title>
                    
                    <description>Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce was back showing his support for girlfriend Taylor Swift, this time in Paris, where he was alongside some A-list celebrities.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &quot;City of Love&quot; was the latest sighting of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/travis-kelce&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Travis Kelce&lt;/a&gt; at a Taylor Swift concert, and he had some A-list celebrities dancing alongside him to his significant other’s chart-topping hits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kansas City Chiefs&lt;/a&gt; superstar tight end was seen at Paris La Défense Arena in Paris where Bradley Cooper and Gigi Hadid were next to him to enjoy Swift’s 87th Eras Tour show. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coincidence on the number, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos have circulated on social media of Kelce dancing to Swift songs, including &quot;… Ready for It?&quot; &quot;Lover&quot; and the classic &quot;You Belong with Me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s significant that Kelce has been spotted at this show as he hasn’t been seen since she went back on tour. Swift has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/france&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Paris&lt;/a&gt; for three nights prior to this fourth and final show, where Kelce was spotted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/travis-kelce-hosting-snl-made-cast-member-feel-very-protective-of-him&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRAVIS KELCE HOSTING ‘SNL’ MADE CAST MEMBER FEEL ‘VERY PROTECTIVE’ OF HIM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this isn’t the first time Kelce has reciprocated the love and support Swift showed during the Chiefs’ Super Bowl-winning season last year. During the Chiefs’ bye week, Kelce was seen in Buenos Aires for one of Swift’s Eras Tour dates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will clearly go the extra mile to support each other; Swift famously flew from Japan to Las Vegas for the Super Bowl after a tour date across the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And fans, whether it was of Kelce first or Swift, have fallen in love with the couple throughout the process as they continue to be one of the world’s power couples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While love isn’t something to rush, many are clamoring to know if Kelce has any thoughts of proposing to Swift to take their relationship to the next level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Chiefs long snapper James Winchester said on the &quot;Like a Farmer&quot; podcast that he thinks his teammate will be engaged at some point because he sees &quot;they’re very similar in a lot of ways.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Being around Trav for the last nine years, I mean, I think they’re more similar than you would think. I wish the best for them,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other than supporting Swift, Kelce has had a great offseason thus far. The Chiefs made him the highest-paid tight end in the game with a new contract extension that’s worth $34.25 million over two years, with $17 million fully guaranteed for the upcoming 2024 campaign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, personally and professionally, Kelce had a lot of things to dance about in Paris with some of his friends while watching Swift kill it onstage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Olivia Munn says she had hysterectomy as part of ‘aggressive’ breast cancer treatment</title>
                    
                    <description>Olivia Munn opened up about having a hysterectomy after previously revealing she underwent a double mastectomy to treat breast cancer.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/olivia-munn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Olivia Munn&lt;/a&gt; is sharing the future of her health and her family after revealing another major surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vogue.com/article/olivia-munn-exclusive-interview-vogue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;with Vogue&lt;/a&gt; published on Sunday, Munn, 43, said that on top of a double mastectomy for breast cancer, she opted for a hysterectomy as part of an overall &quot;aggressive&quot; approach to an aggressive cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was a big decision to make, but it was the best decision for me because I needed to be present for my family,&quot; Munn said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the surgery, Munn was experiencing &quot;debilitating exhaustion&quot; from a medication meant to suppress estrogen, the hormone that could potentially cause the cancer to reoccur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/olivia-munn-disguises-battle-wounds-double-mastectomy-makes-me-a-little-sad&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OLIVIA MUNN DISGUISES &apos;BATTLE WOUNDS&apos; FROM DOUBLE MASTECTOMY: &apos;MAKES ME A LITTLE SAD&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I had friends try to cheer me up by saying, ‘Malcolm’s not going to remember this. Don&apos;t worry.’ But I just kept thinking to myself, ‘I&apos;m going to remember this, that I missed all these things.’ It&apos;s his childhood, but it&apos;s my motherhood, and I don&apos;t want to miss any of these parts if I don&apos;t have to,&quot; she said of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surgery did cause Munn to have &quot;a real breakdown.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Because it’s just so strange when you’ve been with this body your entire life, had your period for so long, feel when you’re ovulating, and all of a sudden it’s gone,&quot; she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munn shares one son, Malcolm, with her partner, comedian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/olivia-munn-john-mulaney-criticism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;John Mulaney,&lt;/a&gt; and she told Vogue she froze her eggs in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/olivia-munn-shares-surprising-tool-led-to-breast-cancer-diagnosis-despite-doing-all-the-tests&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;anticipation of her treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;After my diagnosis, we decided to try one more round of egg retrievals and hoped it was a good month. John and I talked about it a lot, and we don&apos;t feel like we&apos;re done growing our family, but [we] didn&apos;t know if I would have to do chemotherapy or radiation,&quot; Munn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Newsroom&quot; star also did egg retrieval a few years ago at age 39 and earlier at age 33. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We just wanted a few more eggs,&quot; she said. &quot;At my age, one in every 10 eggs are healthy, and we were hoping to make one embryo from this retrieval.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munn was prepared to try a few times, but luckily after the first attempt at creating embryos, the couple had two healthy ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;John and I just started crying. It was just so exciting because not only did we get it in one retrieval, but it also meant that I didn&apos;t have to keep putting myself at risk. It was just amazing,&quot; the &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot; star said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she didn’t share specific plans for a second child with Mulaney, Munn said she’s ready to work with a surrogate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;With a surrogate, you have to try to go find a version of yourself somewhere out in the world. Somebody that you trust as much as yourself to live their life as a pregnant woman the same way that you would. But a surrogate isn’t a scary prospect to me anymore because there’s nothing I can do,&quot; she said. &quot;I don’t have the ability to carry a baby anymore, so if we want to build our family, this is our option. This journey has made me realize how grateful I am to have options for not only fighting cancer but also having more children if we want, because I know a lot of people don’t have those options.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munn announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/olivia-munn-diagnosed-breast-cancer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;her breast cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; on March 13 in an Instagram post, explaining she got an MRI after her doctor found her Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool to be 37%. The MRI found Luminal B cancer, &quot;an aggressive, fast moving cancer,&quot; in both breasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She revealed she had undergone genetic testing, saying, &quot;I tested negative for all, including BRCA (the most well-known breast cancer gene). My sister, Sara, had just tested negative as well. We called each other and high-fived over the phone. That same winter, I also had a normal mammogram.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Two months later, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Florida authorities have identified the remains of Mary Alice Pultz, a woman who was last seen by her family in 1968. Her skull was found at a St. Johns County beach in 1985.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Florida sheriff&apos;s office recently announced that it has identified the victim in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;homicide case&lt;/a&gt; nearly four decades after the investigation went cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;St. Johns County&lt;/a&gt; Sheriff&apos;s Office said in a May 8 press release that human remains were found in a shallow grave on Crescent Beach in April 1985. Crescent Beach is located around 50 miles south of Jacksonville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The initial investigation revealed the victim was a white female, possibly between the ages of 30 and 50 at the time of her death,&quot; the press release said. &quot;Due to the circumstances, the manner of death was determined to be homicide.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of efforts to advance the case, the remains were sent to Othram, a private forensics lab, in 2023. Leads were developed, and investigators visited potential relatives and collected samples. The remains were identified as Mary Alice Pultz in January 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/remains-identified-vietnam-veteran-nearly-50-years-farmers-chasing-pig-stumbled-skeleton&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;REMAINS IDENTIFIED AS VIETNAM VETERAN NEARLY 50 YEARS AFTER FARMERS CHASING PIG STUMBLED UPON SKELETON&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Othram team was able to develop a DNA extract and build a DNA profile for the victim,&quot; the sheriff&apos;s office&apos;s statement explained. &quot;The profile was submitted to consumer genealogy databases where users have submitted their DNA and provided consent for comparison searches. This search resulted in possible relatives of the victim.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pultz was born in 1943 and raised in Maryland. She was last seen by her family in 1968 after leaving with her boyfriend, John Thomas Fugitt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Due to the times, communication was not great,&quot; Sgt. Gene Tolbert said in an interview. &quot;The belief is that Mary Alice and – he went by Tommy – had kind of moved off together, potentially to either Florida or Georgia.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators discovered that Pultz had burr holes in her skull, which showed she underwent brain surgery after 1968. Authorities believe she was &quot;involved in some type of event that caused the traumatic injury and would have required hospitalization.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/33-year-old-california-cold-case-homicide-solved-victims-sister-prayers-answered&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;33-YEAR-OLD CALIFORNIA COLD-CASE HOMICIDE SOLVED AS VICTIM&apos;S SISTER SAYS ‘PRAYERS WERE ANSWERED’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[Chief Medical Examiner Wendolyn Sneed] advised these injuries, in addition to the surgical burr holes, are indicative of severe trauma that would have required hospitalization such as being involved in a vehicle crash or being struck by a vehicle,&quot; the sheriff&apos;s office said. &quot;Additionally, Dr. Sneed discovered evidence of an abscess in the upper gum line of the skull that would have caused discomfort and pain. The analysis provided by Dr. Sneed is for historical purposes and are not related to the cause of death at the time of the homicide.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fugitt is still considered a person of interest in the case. He has since died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Detectives learned that Fugitt, who was known to go by an alias of Billy Joe Wallace, was sentenced to death in Georgia related to a 1981 murder of a male roommate,&quot; the sheriff&apos;s office said in a statement. &quot;Fugitt died in prison prior to his execution.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheriff Rob Hardwick called the homicide investigation &quot;a powerful example that we will never give up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The combination of highly skilled detectives and advanced DNA technology has given Mary Alice’s family some answers about her disappearance close to 40 years ago,&quot; Hardwick said in a statement. &quot;Our Major Crimes detectives are some of the best in the business and I am proud of their dedication to be a voice for homicide victims and their families as we seek closure for loved ones.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;St. Johns County Sheriff&apos;s Office&lt;/a&gt; is actively investigating the homicide.

                    <description>A University of Texas-Austin lecturer lost his job and now faces a criminal charge over an alleged incident with state troopers during an anti-Israel protest</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;University of Texas-Austin&lt;/a&gt; lecturer not only lost his job but is now facing a criminal charge after he was arrested for his alleged involvement in an anti-Israel protest on the campus earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOX 7 in Austin reported that 57-year-old Richard Heyman had been employed by the University of Texas for nearly 18 years. His most recent position at the school was as a lecturer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the university’s website, Heyman has taught courses in subjects like urban studies and contemporary cultural geography, and his interests include urban geography, critical theory and Marxism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heyman was arrested after the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) accused him of interfering with public duties during a pro-Palestinian protest at the Austin, Texas campus on May 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/university-texas-anti-israel-encampment-hamas-propaganda-weapons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS ANTI-ISRAEL ENCAMPMENT SEES HAMAS PROPAGANDA, WEAPONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerry Morris, an attorney representing Heyman, told the station his client was fired, adding that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/college&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the university should&lt;/a&gt; have investigated what happened before taking any action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris did not respond to inquiries from Fox News Digital on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This incident was videotaped by a bystander, and the bystander got in touch with us and gave us the video, and it shows a bit of a different scenario than what’s set out in the arrest affidavit,&quot; Morris told FOX 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas DPS claimed in the affidavit that Heyman yelled expletives in their faces, which Morris did not dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/anti-israel-organizers-george-washington-university-issue-new-demand-campus-takeover-reaches-13th-day&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ANTI-ISRAEL ORGANIZERS AT GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY ISSUE NEW DEMAND AS CAMPUS TAKEOVER REACHES 13TH DAY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his client shouting at police, Morris accused police of initiating physical contact with Heyman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affidavit suggests Heyman attempted to cross a barrier made out of bicycles and put in place by troopers. Heyman allegedly put his fingers in a trooper’s face before acting like he was going to swing a water bottle at the law enforcement official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Police also accused&lt;/a&gt; Heyman of grabbing one of the bicycles and trying to pull it away from the fence, though he broke the bell on the bike in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris told the station his client was pushed and stumbled backwards. As he fell, Heyman grabbed onto the handlebars of the bicycle, the attorney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/college-president-tells-anti-israel-protesters-they-arent-entitled-take-over-whole-univ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;COLLEGE PRESIDENT TELLS ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS THEY AREN&apos;T ENTITLED TO &apos;TAKE OVER THE WHOLE UNIVERSITY&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heyman was not arrested until days later, which Morris said he did not believe would have happened if not for the political pressure on police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There’s so much political pressure on them, if they hadn’t taken some action, I’m sure the governor’s office would have been issuing statements criticizing them and other state officials,&quot; Morris said. &quot;If this case did not have the political implications that it does, if it was not something that had happened in the middle of a politically charged environment, I don’t think it would go forward another day. It’s just going to depend on getting to the decision maker that has the courage to look at the facts and judge the case based on those facts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of Texas did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital&apos;s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court records show Heyman was charged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;interfering with public duties&lt;/a&gt;, a misdemeanor in the state of Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A warrant was issued for his arrest on May 6, and two days later, he appeared in front of a judge who set his bond at $1,000. Heyman later posted bond and was released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heyman is due back in court on May 29.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Trump team fires back at Biden campaign&apos;s Mother&apos;s Day video: &apos;Sad, miserable, cowardly existence&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>President Biden&amp;apos;s team released a new campaign video on Mother&amp;apos;s Day, slamming former President Trump and urging voters to think twice before voting for him.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Biden campaign&lt;/a&gt; is using Mother&apos;s Day to criticize former President Trump in a new campaign video, urging Americans to &quot;Stop Trump.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Happy Mother&apos;s Day. At the Biden campaign, we are asking Americans to do the moms in their lives a favor. Stop Trump,&quot; the Biden campaign wrote in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video, the Biden campaign says that &quot;On Mother’s Day, a reminder: Donald Trump stands only for himself and not mothers across America and their families.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The stakes of this election are high for all Americans, but especially moms across our country who will suffer under a second Trump term,&quot; the video states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jd-vance-slams-ny-v-trump-trial-dem-effort-distract-world-on-fire-under-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JD VANCE SLAMS NY V TRUMP TRIAL AS DEM EFFORT TO DISTRACT THAT THE &apos;WORLD IS ON FIRE&apos; UNDER BIDEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Under Trump, the government will be allowed to monitor their pregnancies, and rip their families apart. Meanwhile President Biden is fighting to bring back his historic expanded Child Tax Credit to give families a little extra breathing room, and ensure paid leave for all Americans,&quot; the message from the Biden campaign continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden campaign noted several points in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;explaining why voters&lt;/a&gt; need to vote for him over Trump in the upcoming election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His reasoning included blaming Trump for families being denied access to fertility treatments; allowing states to monitor women&apos;s pregnancies; that Trump believes women who have an abortion should face &quot;some form of punishment&quot;; and that Trump &quot;proudly separated mothers from their children.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden&apos;s other points said Trump would devastate maternal health and hurt women across the country by working tirelessly to sabotage and repeal the Affordable Care Act; Biden&apos;s final point said Trump&apos;s economic plan would be an &quot;inflation bomb&quot; that would raise costs for mothers and families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Families depend on moms – and moms deserve a President they can depend on to protect their rights, work to lower their costs, and fight for them. Donald Trump wasn’t and isn’t that President, but Joe Biden is,&quot; Biden&apos;s campaign wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/white-house-concerned-trump-rallies-many-100k-deep-blue-new-jersey-extraordinary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHITE HOUSE SHOULD BE &apos;CONCERNED&apos; AS TRUMP RALLIES AS MANY AS 100K IN DEEP-BLUE NEW JERSEY: &apos;EXTRAORDINARY&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the new campaign video, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trump&apos;s team&lt;/a&gt; fired back at the president, calling his video a disgusting move to make, especially on Mother&apos;s Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What a sad, miserable, cowardly existence Crooked Joe Biden and his campaign must have to make such a disgusting ad on such a joyous day. Their lives are obviously filled with anger, hate, and resentment because they clearly suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome,&quot; Trump&apos;s team told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;President Trump continues to live rent-free in their pea-sized brains, even on Mother&apos;s Day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>MLB says Livvy Dunne has entered &apos;WAG era&apos; after Paul Skenes&apos; debut for Pirates</title>
                    
                    <description>Major League Baseball not only hyped up Paul Skenes&amp;apos; big league debut for the Pittsburgh Pirates but also his girlfriend, Olivia Dunne, who was there to support him on Saturday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new era entered Pittsburgh on Saturday, and it wasn’t just Paul Skenes making a fine debut for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/pittsburgh-pirates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Pirates&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His girlfriend, social media sensation and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/lsu-tigers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;LSU gymnast&lt;/a&gt; Olivia &quot;Livvy&quot; Dunne, also entered her &quot;WAG era,&quot; which stands for &quot;wives and girlfriends.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLB hyped up Dunne’s arrival to PNC Park on Saturday just as much as Skenes with a post on the league’s TikTok page, showing Dunne’s excitement for her boyfriend’s debut in an interview with SportsNet Pittsburgh. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLB captioned the post, &quot;Livvy Dunne entering her MLB WAG era.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I always say, it’s way harder to be the person in the stands watching because I’m not in control,&quot; Dunne said in the post. &quot;I can’t control — I don’t know how to throw a 100 mile (per hour) fastball, but it’s hard to have no control. Especially with gymnastics when you’re just watching. But I know he’s got this and I just have a lot of confidence in him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/pirates-rookie-paul-skenes-hits-triple-digits-routinely-strikes-out-7-in-big-league-debut-vs-cubs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PIRATES ROOKIE PAUL SKENES HITS TRIPLE DIGITS ROUTINELY, STRIKES OUT 7 IN BIG LEAGUE DEBUT VS CUBS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sports world saw what the NFL did with pop star Taylor Swift when her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs superstar tight end Travis Kelce went public. And while Dunne’s popularity isn’t even close to Swift’s, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MLB could be taking a page&lt;/a&gt; out of the NFL’s book and lean into appealing to a new demographic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunne, who is coming off an NCAA national championship with LSU’s gymnastics team, is one of the nation’s highest-paid NIL athletes in college sports. She has more than 13.3 million followers between TikTok, Instagram and Twitter, and they’ve all been watching her pages closely to see if there were any hints to Skenes getting called up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skenes, the No. 1 overall pick in last year’s MLB Draft out of LSU, was dominating Triple-A Indianapolis over his first seven starts this season. Because of that, Pirates fans were clamoring for the front office to make the call to bring him to the bigs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The call was finally made this past week, with Dunne revealing that they’d just woke up from a nap to missed calls from the Pirates saying he needed to pack his stuff and head to Pittsburgh. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skenes’ long-awaited debut certainly had more than Dunne nervous as Pirates fans packed PNC Park to watch him face the Chicago Cubs. He didn’t disappoint, striking out his first two batters with a fastball that topped out at 102 mph on the day. Skenes would hit 100 mph with his heater 17 times total throughout the four innings he pitched. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have so many amazing memories with him, but I know how hard he has worked for this moment,&quot; Dunne said in the interview. &quot;Seriously, there’s nothing that can top this. I’m just so proud.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as Skenes remains in MLB, Dunne will be right there supporting him. So, don’t be surprised to see more Dunne content from the league’s socials coming our way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>University of California-Berkeley grads disrupt commencement with anti-Israel protests</title>
                    
                    <description>Hundreds of anti-Israel protesters disrupted UC Berkeley&amp;apos;s commencement ceremony on Saturday, prompting acknowledgments from speakers at the podium. Most were graduating students.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The commencement ceremony held by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; was interrupted by hundreds of anti-Israel protesters on Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the protesters were graduating students, wearing caps and gowns. Pictures show hundreds of students wearing keffiyehs, waving Palestinian flags and holding signage denouncing the Israeli government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interruptions follow weeks of unrest at U.S. universities over the Israel-Hamas war, leading to thousands of students protesting in opposition to Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Viva viva Palestina,&quot; another group was heard chanting during a speech on Saturday. Some sections were completely full of protesters, while others were more scattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/arizona-state-places-police-chief-leave-amid-complaints-alleged-actions-during-anti-israel-protest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARIZONA STATE PLACES POLICE CHIEF ON LEAVE AMID COMPLAINTS OF ALLEGED ACTIONS DURING ANTI-ISRAEL PROTEST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters were also heard yelling the controversial chant, &quot;Palestine will be free / From the river to the sea.&quot; The phrase has been widely deemed antisemitic and even caused U.S. members of congress to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-resolution-condemning-river-sea-chant-antisemitic-passes-44-opposed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;pass a resolution condemning&lt;/a&gt; the use of the chant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A video posted to social media showed a group of students holding up Palestinian flags and clapping while shouting, &quot;End, end, the occupation.&quot; One section was seen holding a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;giant Israeli flag&lt;/a&gt; as a counter-protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UC Berkeley told Fox News Digital that there were no violent incidents or arrests at the ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The protesters left the stadium voluntarily. There was no violence. No one was arrested. The ceremony proceeded as planned,&quot; a university spokesperson explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;UC Berkeley strives to celebrate the achievements of our graduates in a safe and respectful environment. While today’s commencement was, at times, unfortunately disrupted, it did not prevent us from honoring the hard work and accomplishments of our students,&quot; the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speeches went on despite disruptions continuing, but speakers occasionally acknowledged the rowdy sections. Sydney Roberts, president of the Associated Students of the University of California, was interrupted during her speech but continued on after the brief disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/comer-cancels-dc-antisemitism-hearing-bowser-police-finally-dismantle-gwu-encampment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;COMER CANCELS DC ANTISEMITISM HEARING AFTER BOWSER, POLICE &apos;FINALLY DISMANTLE GWU ENCAMPMENT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This wouldn’t be Berkeley without a protest,&quot; she said, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chronicle also reported that UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ commended the anti-Israel protesters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They feel passionately about the brutality and the violence in Gaza, tens of thousands of Palestinians killed and the destruction of educational institutions,&quot; she reportedly said of the students&apos; weeks-long encampment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the protests erupted at the commencement ceremony, graduating students told FOX 2 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/san-francisco&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; that they felt accustomed to protests and did not expect any to get out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know the media might be talking about these protests happening and that it&apos;s disrupting life, but that&apos;s one part of it,&quot; student Kathan Saah told FOX 2. &quot;Life goes on normally, and we try to accommodate the protesters and listen to them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But as long as things don&apos;t get out of hand, it&apos;s fine. We haven&apos;t seen that happen here so it&apos;s been a pretty peaceful situation overall.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another student speculated that the commencement would attract protesters, but predicted it would be tame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If something happened at graduation, I don&apos;t think it would be violent,&quot; Reece Murphy said to FOX 2. &quot;It would happen in a manner that is perfectly appropriate, and if someone feels strongly enough to express themselves during their graduation, they should be heard.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Susan Backlinie, first victim in &apos;Jaws&apos; film, dead at 77</title>
                    
                    <description>Susan Backlinie, known for being the first victim to be eaten by the shark in &amp;quot;Jaws,&amp;quot; has died at 77. Her husband says it was &amp;quot;very unexpected&amp;quot; and that she died from a heart attack.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Susan Backlinie, famously known as the first victim in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;1975 film &quot;Jaws,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; has died, Fox News Digital can confirm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her husband of 30 years, Harvey Swindall, said death was &quot;very unexpected.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/departed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;She died&lt;/a&gt; at their California home on Saturday morning from a heart attack. She was 77.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[She] was the most amazing person I&apos;ve ever met in my life. And I&apos;ve never loved anybody like her,&quot; Swindall said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backlinie earned the role of Chrissie in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/steven-spielberg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Steven Spielberg&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; film not only for her enviable looks but also because she was a nationally ranked swimmer who had worked as a mermaid and animal trainer after graduating from high school in 1964.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I didn’t want an actor to do it. I wanted a stuntperson because I needed somebody who was great in the water, who knew water ballet and knew how to endure what I imagined was going to be a whole lot of violent shaking,&quot; Spielberg recounted in Laurent Bouzereau&apos;s book &quot;Spielberg: The First Ten Years,&quot; per the Hollywood Reporter. &quot;So, I went to stunts to find her, and Susan was up to the challenge.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with the Palm Beach Post in 2017, Backlinie spoke about Spielberg&apos;s vision for what has now become an iconic scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The first thing [Spielberg] said to me was, ‘When your scene is done, I want everyone under the seats with the popcorn and bubblegum,&apos;&quot; she said. &quot;So, I think we did that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While appearing on &quot;The Morning X with Barnes &amp;amp; Leslie&quot; show last year, Backlinie described in her own words how they captured that moment in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What they did was there were some pilings about 50 yards out on the beach, and they ran cables all the way from the beach out to the pilings in two shifts, and then they put me between the two pilings, and they had guys on the beach, about five or six on each cable,&quot; she explained. &quot;We marked lines on the beach, and they would pull me right to the edge of the frame on either side. And the guys just ran back and forth from mark to mark,&quot; she said of the Martha&apos;s Vineyard set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backlinie also refuted a rumor that she&apos;d broken a rib while filming but admitted it was an extremely grueling process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We would film from anywhere from 6 to 7 in the morning till 9 because of the light. … I was home and exhausted at the end of the day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backlinie appeared in a handful of movies, often as a stunt performer. She was also in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;some television shows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>VCU students walk out of Gov Youngkin&apos;s commencement speech</title>
                    
                    <description>About 100 students walked out of Gov. Glenn Youngkin&amp;apos;s commencement address at Virginia Commonwealth University on Saturday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dozens of graduating students walked out of Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) on Saturday after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/virginia-gov-glenn-youngkin-says-support-recently-passed-budget-includes-tax-hike&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Gov. Glenn Youngkin&lt;/a&gt; took the stage to deliver a commencement address. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video of the Saturday morning incident shows throngs of graduates getting up from their seats and leaving the Greater Richmond Convention Center as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/republicans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Republican governor&lt;/a&gt; began talking. A few could be heard cheering the students on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor, who also received an honorary doctorate of humane letters at the commencement ceremony, kicked off his speech with a shout-out to all the mothers ahead of Mother’s Day. He did not acknowledge those leaving and carried on with his speech. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The world needs your music,&quot; Youngkin said to those students still in attendance. &quot;You, all of you, will be the symphony. Make it a masterpiece.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/duke-university-students-walk-jerry-seinfelds-commencement-speech-chant-free-palestine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DUKE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WALK OUT ON JERRY SEINFELD&apos;S COMMENCEMENT SPEECH, CHANT ‘FREE PALESTINE’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many who left during Youngkin’s speech showed support for Palestinians amid Israel’s ongoing war in the Gaza Strip against Hamas terrorists. Others held signs signaling their opposition to the governor’s education policies, per reporting from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/vcu-graduates-walkout-during-gov-youngkins-speech-at-commencement-ceremony/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;local outlet WRIC-TV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dissenters marched around the perimeter while chanting, &quot;No books, no peace, let the knowledge increase&quot; and &quot;Disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest.&quot; Later, a group of graduates, many still in their graduation gowns, ended up in a park and chanted, &quot;The people united will never be defeated.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to VCU and the governor’s office for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/may-10-anti-israel-protests&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS SWEEP US COLLEGE CAMPUSES AROUND THE NATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar scenes unfolded at other commencement ceremonies across the country on Saturday following weeks of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-protests&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;unrest on college campuses&lt;/a&gt; that saw anti-Israel protesters square off against administrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday was less chaotic than Friday, when police arrested dozens on other college campuses and took down encampments at the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology – actions that came hours after police deployed tear gas on demonstrators at the University of Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Both of the individuals face charges related to battery on a law enforcement officer, the station reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were about 1,200 people at the Lake Eola Park protest, where officers used a chemical agent to disperse a disruptive bunch in the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While most demonstrated peacefully, we did make 2 arrests,&quot; the Orlando &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Police Department&lt;/a&gt; wrote in a press release. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Israel-Hamas war would &apos;probably already been over&apos; if Trump were president, Sen. Tom Cotton says</title>
                    
                    <description>The Republican senator from Arkansas says the Israel-Hamas war &amp;quot;would have never happened&amp;quot; under President Trump during a &amp;quot;Face the Nation&amp;quot; interview Sunday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Republican senator from Arkansas says the Israel-Hamas war &quot;would have probably already been over&quot; if Donald Trump were president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Cotton appeared on CBS&apos; &quot;Face the Nation&quot; Sunday when he made the remarks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;President Trump said just last night that he would absolutely provide Israel with the weapons they need to finish the job,&quot; Cotton said. &quot;This would have never happened on President Trump. Trump&apos;s watch. It didn&apos;t happen on his watch. And if he were president, this war would have probably already been over with much less civilian suffering in Gaza because he would have backed Israel to the hilt from the beginning.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the GOP senator renewed the call to impeach President Biden following reports of aid to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-administration-confirms-paused-shipment-bombs-israel-over-opposition-operation-rafah&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Israel being delayed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during its war with the terrorist organization Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/no-choice-impeach-biden-delayed-israel-aid-gop-senator-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&apos;NO CHOICE&apos; BUT TO IMPEACH BIDEN OVER DELAYED ISRAEL AID, GOP SENATOR SAYS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recently passed $95 billion &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;supplemental foreign aid package&lt;/a&gt; included roughly $26 billion for both Israel and humanitarian aid for areas including Gaza. The aid was encouraged by the Biden administration, which had proposed it nearly six months prior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cotton suggested that Biden should be impeached for delaying an aid shipment to Israel, which he claimed had to do with the president&apos;s re-election bid as he balances a divided Democratic Party on the Israel war. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/sen-tom-cotton-demands-biden-crack-down-anti-israel-agitators-college-campuses&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEN. TOM COTTON DEMANDS BIDEN CRACK DOWN ON ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Cotton called on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden administration&lt;/a&gt; to deport any foreign student engaging in disruptive demonstrations on college campuses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Julia Johnson, Kristine Parks, Liz Friden and Jacqui Heinrich contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Graham: Biden threat to pull military aid for Israel &apos;rewarding the tactics of Hamas to put civilians at risk&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said if President Biden pauses more offensive military assistance to Israel, his administration would be &amp;quot;rewarding tactics of Hamas.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sen. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-fire-withholding-weapons-gaza-offensive-creating-nightmare-israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Lindsey Graham&lt;/a&gt;, R-S.C., said should the Biden administration follow through on its threat to stall U.S. military aid for Israel, the White House would be &quot;rewarding the tactics of Hamas to put civilians at risk.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an appearance on NBC&apos;s &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Graham said &quot;it&apos;s impossible to mitigate civilian deaths in Gaza as long as Hamas uses their own population as human shields.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve never seen in the history of warfare such blatant efforts by an enemy, Hamas, to put civilians at risk. And the last thing you want to do is reward this behavior. They put weapons in mosques. They fire artillery rounds from apartment buildings. They put command centers under hospitals to maximize civilian casualties as Israel tries to destroy the terrorist group,&quot; Graham told host Kristen Welker. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Americans should be all in and helping Israel against an existential threat. The one thing Israel and America has in common,&quot; Graham continued &quot;Hamas would attack us if they could. Iran is the largest state sponsor of terrorism that shouts ‘Death to America, ’and Hezbollah is in the same camp. I&apos;ve never heard anybody in Israel chant &apos;Death to America.&apos; The people Israel is fighting are bent on destroying all of the Jews. This is Holocaust Remembrance Month, for God&apos;s sake. We should unequivocally support Israel. Yes. Work with them to limit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/state-department-criticizes-israels-attempts-mitigating-civilian-harm-gaza-war-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;civilian casualties&lt;/a&gt;. They want to do that. I know they do. They have a whole battalion dedicated to that. But this idea of worth holding weapons to Israel is rewarding the tactics of Hamas to put civilians at risk.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bernie-sanders-israel-shouldnt-receive-another-nickel-us-military-aid-state-dept-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BERNIE SANDERS SAYS ISRAEL SHOULDN&apos;T RECEIVE &apos;ANOTHER NICKEL&apos; IN US MILITARY AID AFTER STATE DEPT. REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a message to the Biden administration, Graham said &quot;sit down with Israel, keep the weapons flowing and work out a plan, if you can.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I talked with Israel this morning. They are discussing with the Biden administration a way forward. I am somewhat hopeful we can jump over this impasse, but do not let &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bernie-sanders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Bernie Sanders&lt;/a&gt; run this war. Bernie Sanders and the Squad are insane when it comes to how to defend Israel, he just said on national television – cut off every nickel of military aid to the Jewish state who&apos;s being threatened with oblivion. Shut these people down. This decision was political. He&apos;s trying to appease the radical left, Biden is.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mother-hamas-hostage-us-shouldnt-considered-neutral-negotiator-america-also-victim&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MOTHER OF HAMAS HOSTAGE SAYS US SHOULDN&apos;T BE CONSIDERED &apos;NEUTRAL NEGOTIATOR&apos;: &apos;AMERICA WAS ALSO A VICTIM&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier on the same program, Sanders had argued &quot;Israel should not be receiving another nickel in U.S. military aid,&quot; pointing to a recent State Department report suggesting Israel could be violating internation law in the way it&apos;s conducting its war against Hamas since the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks on southern Israel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham also attempted to make a comparison to the United States&apos; actions to end &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/world-war-two&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; in dropping the atomic bomb on Japan to justify the Israel Defense Forces&apos; actions against Hamas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Here&apos;s what I would say about fighting an enemy who wants to kill you and your family. Why do we drop two bombs, nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki? To end a war that we couldn&apos;t afford to lose. You don&apos;t understand. Apparently, what Israel is facing. They&apos;re facing three groups. Iran, who has received $80 billion in aid. When Trump left office, they were exporting 300 barrels of oil a day. Now they&apos;re 1.3 million a day. They&apos;ve been enriched by Biden. They&apos;re taking that money to kill all the Jews,&quot; Graham said. &quot;Give Israel the bombs they need to end the war. They can&apos;t afford to lose and work with them to minimize casualties.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Bill Maher: I speak for the &apos;vast middle&apos; and &apos;normies&apos; tired of tribal politics</title>
                    
                    <description>“Real Time&amp;quot; comedian Bill Maher discussed his attacks on both the right and the left while promoting his new book on CBS News&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Sunday Morning&amp;quot; show.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-warns-biden-only-dem-lose-trump-in-2024-ruth-bader-ginsburg-presidency&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Real Time&quot; host Bill Maher&lt;/a&gt; argued he spoke for the &quot;normies&quot; in America tired of the extreme right and left in politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maher spoke to CBS correspondent Robert Costa about his upcoming book &quot;What This Comedian Said Will Shock You&quot; and explained that his goal on his HBO show is to avoid being &quot;tribal.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I speak for the normies. I speak for that vast middle that is tired of the partisanship. I don’t want to hate half the country, and I don’t hate half the country,&quot; Maher said on &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costa pressed Maher further about his recent incessant attacks against Democrats despite claiming to be more concerned about Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-unleashes-stormy-daniels-testimony-trump-trial-shes-bad-witness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BILL MAHER UNLEASHES ON STORMY DANIELS’ TESTIMONY IN TRUMP TRIAL: &apos;SHE&apos;S A BAD WITNESS!&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You write a lot throughout this book that the left irritates you, frustrates you at times, but the right often alarms you,&quot; Costa started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes. They’re very alarming. They’re extremely alarming. More alarming,&quot; Maher responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costa continued, &quot;What do you say to your critics, though, who say that you should just focus on them, Bill, if they’re more alarming to you than the left? And why not shine the spotlight on them only?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The truth isn’t one-sided like that. The Democrats constantly are running against Trump with the idea ‘You people out there couldn’t possibly vote for this guy.’ And people are saying, ‘Watch me. Hold my beer. Watch me vote for him again,’&quot; Maher explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maher had previously hosted Republican figures on the show like former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr and said that former President Donald Trump has an &quot;open invitation&quot; to come if he liked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not all his Democratic friends agreed with his choice to host Barr, Maher revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yeah, this is exactly what I hate about this country. ‘How dare you? How dare you platform someone,’&quot; Maher quoted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, &quot;You’re gonna have to talk to people, and maybe you’ll find out that they are not the monsters you think they are.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-says-wont-f-ing-nuts-get-anxious-millennial-trump-wins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BILL MAHER SAYS HE WON&apos;T &apos;GO F---ING NUTS AGAIN&apos; AND &apos;GET ANXIOUS LIKE A MILLENNIAL&apos; IF TRUMP WINS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Maher has been one of the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-vows-everything-can-make-sure-trump-loses-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;vocal Trump critics&lt;/a&gt; in Hollywood, he’s more recently received attention over his attacks against liberals for focusing on woke issues like pushing transgender ideology and treatments onto children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And this is why people vote for Trump,&quot; he told his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/maher-warns-liberals-ideological-gas-pedal-politics-not-if-driving-off-cliff&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;audience in April&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;They say in politics, liberals are the gas pedal and conservatives are the brakes. And I&apos;m generally with the gas pedal, but not if we&apos;re driving off a cliff. On the trans issue, America is no ands, ifs or buts about it, absolutely alone in the world now, an outlier country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Chargers former GM AJ Smith dead at 75, family announces</title>
                    
                    <description>Former Los Angeles Chargers general manager A.J. Smith, who was responsible for the winningest tenure in team history, has died at 75.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A.J. Smith, the winningest general manager in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/los-angeles-chargers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Chargers&lt;/a&gt; history, has died, the family announced Sunday. He was 75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith had been battling prostate cancer for several years, his family noted in their announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Belying a tough, matter of fact and no nonsense persona – one synonymous with that of a true football guy – was A.J.’s softer side which included a tremendous love for his family, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the NFL&lt;/a&gt; and the Chargers. The architect of one of the greatest chapters in franchise history, A.J. made everyone around him better with a singular focus and intensity that elevated our organization,&quot; Chargers owner and board chair Dean Spanos said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our hearts are with his wife Sue, son Kyle, daughter Andrea and the entire Smith family during this difficult time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith’s journey in the NFL didn’t start at the top as he worked his way up from a part-time scout of the then-San Diego Chargers to general manager in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith built the franchise to its best years from 2003 to 2012, when it won 98 games during his 10 seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfl-legend-jerry-rice-hot-over-brenden-rices-draft-tumble-but-confident-son-will-prove-doubters-wrong&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NFL LEGEND JERRY RICE ‘HOT’ OVER BRENDEN RICE&apos;S DRAFT TUMBLE BUT CONFIDENT SON WILL PROVE DOUBTERS WRONG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most infamous moves in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl-draft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; history came with Smith at the helm in 2004, when Eli Manning and his father, Archie, requested the Chargers not draft him first overall out of Ole Miss. But Smith did it anyway and orchestrated a trade with the New York Giants to have them draft Philip Rivers while also acquiring more draft picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith would use those to draft three-time Pro Bowl linebacker and 2005 AP Defensive Rookie of the Year Shawne Merriman as well as two-time Pro Bowl kicker Nate Kaeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivers, of course, went on to be the best Chargers quarterback in team history, though Manning would go on to win two Super Bowls with the Giants. Rivers set franchise records with 59,271 yards and 397 touchdown passes during his illustrious tenure with the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith also made the call to sign Antonio Gates as an undrafted free agent in 2003; Gates is the all-time franchise record holder with 955 receptions, 11,841 receiving yards and 116 touchdowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith also hired Norv Turner as the team’s head coach in 2007, who replaced Marty Schottenheimer. Smith and Schottenheimer did not have a good relationship, and Smith knew he needed to make the right hire to keep the Chargers moving in the right trajectory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turner would go 56-40 during his time with the Chargers, but after no Super Bowls, Spanos decided to go in a different direction altogether, firing both the coach and Smith in 2012 after the team went 7-9. However, it was just Smith’s second losing season as GM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith’s son, Kyle, followed in his father&apos;s footsteps and is now the assistant GM for the Atlanta Falcons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is also survived by his wife, Susan, his daughter, Andrea, his son-in-law, Noah, and his three grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Massive Trump beach rally in deep-blue NJ draws stark contrast to Biden&apos;s beach weekend: &apos;Biden could never&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Critics on social media argue President Biden could not pull a massive crowd like former President Trump in Wildwood, New Jersey, as they slam the current president for his beach weekend.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Critics of President Biden are lambasting his beach vacation in Delaware while contrasting the Mother&apos;s Day weekend getaway to former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Trump&apos;s massive rally&lt;/a&gt; in the historically blue state of New Jersey on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Supporters camped out overnight at the beach for a Trump rally that starts at 5PM today in Wildwood. Joe Biden can’t fill up a broom closet without staff, media, and angry protesters (sic),&quot; one X user under the name &quot;Bad Hombre&quot; posted Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump held a beachside rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, on Saturday evening as at least 80,000, and up to 100,000 supporters, joined the 45th president in the historically deep-blue state. Simultaneously, 24 miles across Deleware Bay, Biden arrived at his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/delaware&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;home in Rehoboth Beach&lt;/a&gt; for Mother’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden’s trip followed&lt;/a&gt; a fundraising event in Seattle, where he was greeted by local leaders such as Democrat Gov. Jay Inslee and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., as well as a group of left-wing anti-Israel protesters holding signs that read &quot;Traitor Genocide Joe Free Palestine&quot; and &quot;Genocide Joe Must Go,&quot; the Seattle Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-supporters-flock-massive-new-jersey-campaign-rally-hear-former-president-speak-amid-ongoing-trials&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP SUPPORTERS FLOCK TO MASSIVE NEW JERSEY CAMPAIGN RALLY TO HEAR FORMER PRESIDENT SPEAK AMID ONGOING TRIALS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of last fall, Biden was on course to spend about 40% of his presidency on vacation, compared to Trump reportedly spending 26% of his time outside Washington, D.C., when he was in office and President Obama&apos;s reported 11% of vacation time, the New York Post previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media commenters jumped at comparing Trump’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;massive rally on the Jersey Shore&lt;/a&gt; to Biden spending the weekend at his Delaware beach house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Crooked Joe Biden will soon head to his beach house for a weekend of rest.

Could Biden ever get this many people to a rally?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/50-cent-rips-biden-delaware-beach-trip-amid-israel-hamas-war&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50 CENT RIPS BIDEN FOR DELAWARE BEACH TRIP AMID ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR: &apos;WE GOT SOME REAL S--- GOING ON&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Fox News Digital spoke to Trump rally attendees who described happily waiting on the beach for the former president and foreseeing big Trump wins in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think this country needs to change, although we already know what Trump&apos;s all about,&quot; said one supporter who identified himself as &quot;Carlos.&quot; &quot;So, that change is just going to come right back to us because that&apos;s what we need. We need Trump because I don&apos;t think Biden is just getting the job done right now. Some of it&apos;s his fault. Some of it is probably the people around him. But I think we need Trump back to get this country back to where it needs to be.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about Trump’s prospects in November, Carlos pointed to the large crowd and said, &quot;Take a look.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There’s probably about six to 7,000 people waiting in line and probably more. [The line] goes all the way back to the entrance. So, you’re looking at 35 to 40,000 people at this venue right now,&quot; he said, noting that some people had been waiting since Thursday for the venue to open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An attendee named &quot;Lisa,&quot; who traveled from Westchester County, New York, described herself as a &quot;convert&quot; supporter of Trump despite having come from a long line of liberals in her family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-blasts-house-for-2-week-vacation-despite-facing-criticism-for-his-frequent-beach-trips&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN BLASTS HOUSE FOR 2-WEEK &apos;VACATION&apos; DESPITE FACING CRITICISM FOR HIS FREQUENT BEACH TRIPS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s just like something overnight shifted in the culture that I didn&apos;t realize,&quot; she said. &quot;I was taking stuff at face value, and the minute the walls came crumbling down, I just started [going] deep into everything.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump was joined by New Jersey Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew, who also left the Democrat Party for the GOP under the Trump administration. He described the Wildwood event as historical for the Garden State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This has got to be the biggest political rally in the history of New Jersey,&quot; Van Drew told the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common theme amid the lengthy rally, which wrapped up around 8 p.m., was the argument that Trump will win the historically deep-blue state come November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’re going to win New Jersey,&quot; the GOP front-runner told the crowd to exuberant cheers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6351068111112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIKE HUCKABEE: THE ONLY TIME BIDEN IS WINNING IS ON THE BEACH OR IN HIS BASEMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As you can see today, we’re expanding the electoral map because … we’re going to win the state of New Jersey,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I think we’re going to win them all. All across America, millions of people, so-called blue states, are joining our movement based on love, intelligence and a thing called common sense.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to New Jerseyans, the rally also drew a large crowd from the key battleground state of Pennsylvania as well as attendees from deep-blue New York and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump focused on the economy and inflation through much of the event, highlighting that the prices of everything from hot dogs to chicken and gasoline shot up during the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Biden price hikes are continuing to drain over $1,000 from the typical New Jersey family budget every single month,&quot; Trump said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-says-wasnt-vacation-visiting-home-rehoboth-beach-delaware-cant-go-home-home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN SAYS HE WASN&apos;T ON VACATION WHILE VISITING HOME IN REHOBOTH BEACH, DELAWARE: &apos;I CAN&apos;T GO HOME HOME&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On day one, we will throw out Bidenomics, and we will reinstate MAGAnomics,&quot; he said. &quot;And we’re going to bring manufacturing, tourism and other industries back to New Jersey like we’ve never seen before.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-says-he-hasnt-been-able-break-east-palestine-visit-despite-lake-tahoe-getaway-de-trips&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN SAYS HE HASN&apos;T ‘BEEN ABLE TO BREAK’ FOR EAST PALESTINE VISIT, DESPITE LAKE TAHOE GETAWAY, DE TRIPS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump lambasted Biden ​​as a &quot;moron&quot; and the &quot;worst president that we’ve ever had&quot; in comments to the raucous crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;He’s surrendering our college campuses&lt;/a&gt; to anarchists, jihadist freaks and anti-American extremists who are trying to tear down our American flag. They want to tear down every single place they go,&quot; Trump said before calling on Biden and the Democratic National Committee &quot;to return the donations of all antisemites, American haters and financiers of chaos on our campuses.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden campaign referred Fox News Digital to a campaign email titled &quot;&apos;Juggernaut&apos; No More - Trump’s Non-Campaign Peddles Desperate Spin&quot; when asked about the rally and criticisms Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Republicans* are begging for support from Trump’s broke campaign,&quot; the email states. &quot;The calls are coming from inside the GOP. We told you the campaign was broke, understaffed, driving moderate voters away, and can’t build the campaign infrastructure necessary to win 270 electoral votes in November. Republicans across battleground states are saying the same exact thing, and sounding the alarm about the prospects of the Trump campaign.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The massive and potentially historic rally in New Jersey comes as Trump continues his trial in New York City, where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records. The former president has denied all charges against him. Trump, who is under a gag order amid the trial, has repeatedly slammed the case as a &quot;scam&quot; promoted by the Biden administration ahead of the general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Andrew Mark Miller and Bradford Betz contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Idaho emergency room doctor dies in avalanche on ski trip</title>
                    
                    <description>Dr. Terrence O&amp;apos;Connor was skiing with a partner when the snowslide began on Friday; residents on social media say the 48-year-old ER doctor was a &amp;quot;outstanding physician&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A nature-loving doctor was killed in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/avalanche&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;avalanche&lt;/a&gt; on Friday while he was skiing in Idaho, authorities say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/idaho&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ketchum, Idaho&lt;/a&gt;, resident Dr. Terrence &quot;Terry&quot; O&apos;Connor was identified as the sole victim of the avalanche, officials said. The Custer County Coroner&apos;s Office confirmed the death to Fox News Digital on Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 48-year-old was skiing with a partner on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Donaldson Peak&lt;/a&gt; in the Lost River Range when he accidentally triggered the snowslide, according to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The avalanche began at around 11:55 a.m., according to officials. In reports from authorities, O&apos;Connor was referred to as Skier 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/fatal-wyoming-skiing-collision-killed-legendary-outdoorsman-ruled-homicide-coroner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FATAL WYOMING SKIING COLLISION THAT KILLED LEGENDARY OUTDOORSMAN RULED &apos;HOMICIDE&apos;: CORONER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While downclimbing to their ski descent, Skier 1 triggered and was caught in a small wind slab avalanche,&quot; a report from the Sawtooth Avalanche Center reads. &quot;The slide carried Skier 1 downhill, triggering a second and larger avalanche.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report added that O&apos;Connor&apos;s ski partner acted quickly to remove him from the snow and alert authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Skier 2 used a satellite communication device to call for help before descending the avalanche path,&quot; the statement continues. &quot;She located Skier 1 with her rescue transceiver and probe pole. Skier 1 was buried under at least 5 feet of snow.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She dug Skier 1 out of the snow with her shovel and began CPR. Search and rescue teams responded and evacuated Skier 1, but he did not survive the accident.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/3-dutch-skiers-killed-austrian-alps-avalanche&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;3 DUTCH SKIERS KILLED IN AUSTRIAN ALPS AVALANCHE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O&apos;Connor and his ski partner were both experienced backcountry skiers, the Sawtooth Avalanche Center said. At the time of his death, O&apos;Connor worked as an emergency room physician at St. Luke’s Wood River Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Idaho EMS Physician Commission, which O&apos;Connor was previously affiliated with, made a Facebook post expressing its condolences over the tragic death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Terry was an outstanding physician and played a pivotal role in the early days of the COVID pandemic really demonstrating the public health role of the EMS medical director within a community,&quot; the Facebook post reads. &quot;His loss will be missed not only in the valley itself but throughout the entire state and region.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O&apos;Connor&apos;s death sparked sympathetic reactions on social media, with many members of his community praising him for his service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A hero to all of us and a life lived with such grace and enthusiasm,&quot; one Facebook user wrote. &quot;Thank you [for] being an amazing example to all of us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is no way to understand a loss like this,&quot; another commenter wrote. &quot;He gave so much in so many ways. His worth cannot be measured or replaced.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Few films have a mouth-watering impact on audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bruschetta scene from &quot;Julie &amp;amp; Julia&quot; is certainly one that warrants salivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruschetta, pronounced brew-sket-taah, dates back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/italy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ancient Rome&lt;/a&gt; and is most favorably made with fresh, ripe local ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/julia-child-a-legacy-of-teaching-the-joy-of-food&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JULIA CHILD, A LEGACY OF TEACHING THE JOY OF FOOD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an authentic bruschetta recipe, a few ingredients are required to both fill and satisfy guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Begin by slicing ¼-½ inch slices of bread, if they are not already in pieces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tomato mixture will be heavy, so cut the slices thick enough to hold the ingredients. Wash and dice heirloom tomatoes into small pieces, and include the seeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The middle of the tomato will add plenty of juice to the mixture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/the-godfather-spaghetti-sauce-recipe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO MAKE ‘THE GODFATHER’ SUNDAY SAUCE RECIPE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a dash of salt and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/lemon-basil-pasta-recipe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;fresh basil&lt;/a&gt; leaves sliced into ribbons to a bowl filled with diced tomatoes. Gently mix with a spoon to combine all ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Place the oil in a pan over medium heat on the stovetop and add slices of bread. If the bread is too big for the pan, or you prefer smaller slices, cut each piece in half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown the bread until it is golden and flip it over to crisp the other side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the bread is toasted, remove it and rub fresh garlic cloves over the slices. In doing so, you will experience little garlic flavor in each bite of bruschetta without overpowering the appetizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cover the bread slices with the tomato mixture and serve immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, the comedy-drama &quot;Julie &amp;amp; Julia&quot; debuted to audiences in theaters across North America and detailed the story, written and directed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sleepless-in-seattle-writer-nora-ephron-dies-at-71&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Nora Ephron&lt;/a&gt;, of an exhausted woman who was seeking a change of pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Powell, played by Amy Adams, answers the phone calls of survivors and victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks against America, family members of those who lost loved ones, and callers who have nothing nice to say about the controversial rebuilding of the Twin Towers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her day-to-day life is grief-stricken, and she is challenged to find happiness in her workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/julie-powell-food-writer-of-julie-julia-dead-49&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JULIE POWELL, FOOD WRITER OF ‘JULIE &amp;amp; JULIA,&apos; DEAD AT 49&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most memorable scenes cuts back and forth to Powell as she chops whole, sweet heirloom tomatoes and pan frying toast over hot oil while her husband, Eric, played by Chris Messina, is on the couch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple is discussing one of Powell’s coworkers beginning a blog. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the conversation continues, Powell serves her husband a plate of some of the juiciest-looking bruschetta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Eric stuffs his face with the appetizer, he mumbles, &quot;This is good. This is really good,&quot; through pockets of air — and encourages his wife to start her own blog about cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, Powell decided to cook 524 recipes crafted by Julia Child, a renowned chef who made &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/france&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;French cuisine&lt;/a&gt; accessible to American audiences, and blog about it for 365 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The whole idea of writing a blog is to get away from what I do all day, the way that cooking is a way that I get away from what I do all day,&quot; Powell says in the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film alternates between Powell producing her blog in the early 2000s and Child, played by Meryl Streep, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;crafting recipes&lt;/a&gt; and writing a controversial cookbook in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the film, viewers see Powell become engrossed in her blog, and she disregards her husband completely in favor of her writing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The marriage sees conflict as her pieces paying homage to Child take flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Street was nominated for an Academy Award for best actress, though she lost to Sandra Bullock for her work as Leigh Ann Tuohy in &quot;The Blind Side.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meryl-streep-wins-one-spains-most-prestigious-awards&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Streep won&lt;/a&gt; best actress in a musical or comedy Golden Globe for &quot;Julie &amp;amp; Julia.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Ex-Mumford &amp; Sons guitarist hopes new festival will be hub for viewpoint diversity &apos;where real debate happens&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>The former Mumford &amp;amp; Sons guitarist Winston Marshall spoke with Fox News Digital about the new festival he hopes to be a hub for diversity of opinion.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK CITY -&lt;/strong&gt; Cancel culture has taken many victims in recent years, but one former musician is combating the silencing of unpopular opinion with what he hopes to be a new annual conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winston Marshall, the British banjoist and guitarist who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/cancel-culture-mumford-sons-band-antifa-book&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;left the band Mumford &amp;amp; Sons&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 after daring to like a book from journalist Andy Ngo, just wrapped hosting the inaugural Dissident Dialogues, a festival he says celebrates the diversity of opinion.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of talk of diversity these days, but not that much talk about diversity of opinion, my favorite kind of diversity,&quot; Marshall told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt; in an interview. &quot;I was plunged into the ideas space a few years ago. And one of the things I noticed is that people are dying to talk to other people, to hash out their ideas. So I thought, &apos;Oh, that&apos;s interesting.&apos;&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/ground-mumford-sons-guitarist-winston-marshall-tweet-ended-career&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘STAND YOUR GROUND’: FORMER MUMFORD &amp;amp; SONS GUITARIST WINSTON MARSHALL STANDS BEHIND CAREER-ENDING TWEET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Having come from a music background, having put on 20 to 25 festivals across America, all over the world, I knew that people actually love that. People actually love coming together. So I thought, let&apos;s try and apply the rock and roll thing to the idea space,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dissident Dialogues, held last weekend in Brooklyn&apos;s Duggal Greenhouse, hosted an impressive roster of prominent voices like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/iranian-american-journalist-blasts-progressives-urges-michelle-obama-oprah-help-iranian-women&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Iranian journalist and activist Masih Alinejad&lt;/a&gt;, famed atheist and biologist Richard Dawkins, Somali author and advocate Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Harvard professor Steven Pinker, and independent journalists including Michael Shellenberger, Lee Fang and Alex Berenson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also speaking at the festival was Uri Berliner, the veteran NPR editor who was forced to resign after speaking out against the liberal groupthink that took over the outlet&apos;s newsroom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/ex-npr-editor-knocks-ceo-katherine-maher-crossed-newsroom-firewall-rebuking-essay&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EX-NPR EDITOR KNOCKS CEO KATHERINE MAHER, SAYS SHE CROSSED NEWSROOM ‘FIREWALL’ BY PUBLICLY REBUKING HIS ESSAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re also talking about heterodoxy, thinking freely, thinking differently, thinking for yourself. And I would also add that we&apos;re very keen for all ideas,&quot; Marshall said. &quot;We&apos;re not an anti-woke festival. We want everyone at the table, and we&apos;re very keen for all ideas to be challenged and brought in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So that&apos;s my dream for the future. Let&apos;s be the festival where real debate happens from a broad stroke, a broad spectrum of people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most fiery moments of Dissident Dialogues was a debate on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Israel-Hamas war&lt;/a&gt; with The Free Press reporter Eli Lake and The Fifth Column podcast co-host Michael Moynihan on the pro-Israel side squaring off against former Bernie Sanders press secretary Briahna Joy Gray and writer Joseph (Jake) Klein on the anti-Israel side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other topics tackled in panel discussions include transgender medicine, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/college&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;current state of colleges&lt;/a&gt;, government censorship, feminism, religion and wokeism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/winston-marshall-senses-americas-woke-culture-seeping-into-uk-tide-could-be-turning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINSTON MARSHALL SENSES AMERICA&apos;S ‘WOKE’ CULTURE SEEPING INTO THE UK, BUT THE TIDE COULD BE TURNING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s a really wonderful atmosphere. It&apos;s a very loving atmosphere. We have atheists, theists, libertarians, Marxists, liberals, progressives, conservatives, everything. And I hope we can attract even more,&quot; Marshall told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marshall already teased to festival attendees that Dissident Dialogues will return in 2025. And he&apos;s hoping to platform even more different viewpoints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We need more diversity of opinion. I think you can never have too much diversity of opinion. It is hard sometimes to get people from different opinions. Not everyone likes confrontation, but my hope is that we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/culture-trends&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;foster a culture&lt;/a&gt; of disagreeing agreeably, even if it gets a little sizzly and spicy on stage,&quot; Marshall said. &quot;I think it&apos;s better for society.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Singles looking for a specific type of person are attending dating events across the country tailored to their needs — including first responders, tall people, fit people and many other love-match types.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the year 2024, plenty of people are tired of swiping away in an effort to find a love match. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid all the dating app fatigue, some people are going back to basics by getting out of the house and socializing to find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/relationships&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a potential life partner.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single and The City, an events-based company, is helping match people looking for a specific type of person, no matter what type of person that might be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/new-york-woman-tiktok-viral-printing-500-business-cards-help-friend-find-date&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK WOMAN GOES TIKTOK VIRAL AFTER PRINTING 500 BUSINESS CARDS TO HELP FRIEND FIND A DATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The desired might be someone who’s a first responder — a firefighter, police officer or emergency medical technician. Or it might be someone who&apos;s fit and active. Single and The City founder Amber Soletti, an Austin native, said there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was 2008 [and] I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;living in New York City&lt;/a&gt; working in the beauty industry, where the few men at my work were either gay or married,&quot; she told Fox News Digital about her background. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added, &quot;I was not meeting the type of singles [that] I was interested in dating and decided I needed to start my own singles company to raise the bar — with the goal of meeting someone through one of my events.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Single and The City hosts events for singles to mingle in New York City and Austin, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/texas-bachelor-70-looking-love-pays-400-week-billboard-sign-enjoying-karaoke&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEXAS BACHELOR, 70, IS LOOKING FOR LOVE, PAYS $400 A WEEK FOR BILLBOARD SIGN ABOUT ‘ENJOYING KARAOKE’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soletti said Single and The City hosts events based on &quot;dating dealbreakers,&quot; such as ones based on physical preferences, common interests or backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Soletti’s most popular events is called the &quot;Rescue Me&quot; singles party — which is where women &quot;get to mix and mingle with NY’s most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;eligible first responders.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The events, which typically bring in anywhere from 75 to 250 people, require men to show their agency ID at the check-in to prove they are first responders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, icebreaker cards are given out to women with first responder trivia questions to allow women to approach different men without feeling nervous or uncomfortable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/toronto-woman-takes-approach-dating-stamping-hands-bars-youre-cute-hit-me-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TORONTO WOMAN TAKES NOVEL APPROACH TO DATING BY STAMPING HANDS AT BARS: ‘YOU’RE CUTE, YOU SHOULD HIT ME UP&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Women also get a red dot at check-in, which is their vote for the hottest first responder that they stick on the guy they think is the hottest,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other popular events include Ivy League dating, finance dating, size matters, Fleet Week and Jewish speed dating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivy League dating is for those who went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ivy League schools;&lt;/a&gt; size matters is for taller people looking for a taller spouse; and Fleet Week dating is hosted during New York City&apos;s annual Fleet Week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soletti told Fox News Digital that Single and The City has seen a 67% increase in attendance this year from last — saying it’s largely due to people having app frustration and fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/new-york-woman-goes-boy-sober-feeling-deflated-dating-scene-miserable&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK WOMAN GOES ‘BOY SOBER’ AFTER FEELING DEFLATED BY DATING SCENE: ‘WAS SO MISERABLE’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;With dating apps and sites, there is a ton of time invested and wasted reading profiles, swiping, corresponding and waiting for a response,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In-person events are a great way to meet a large number of singles in one evening and to quickly assess if you have chemistry with someone and want to go on a first date.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relationships expert Alana Carvalho, known online as The Codependent Perfectionist, told Fox News Digital that social events for dating are a &quot;yes&quot; in her book. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s so difficult to find [a] connection, and dating websites just aren’t cutting it for a lot of singles,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I often find that my clients feel further disconnected and disenfranchised by online dating,&quot; she added, &quot;so I highly encourage any in-person meet-ups.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soletti said she recommends that people who are going to singles events keep an open mind and not put too much pressure on one night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You can’t go to a few events, not meet anyone you like and say that you are done with singles events [because] they don’t work,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, she said, &quot;when you get frustrated, or the prospect of meeting someone seems overwhelming, you just need to remember that different singles come out to each event and that all it takes is one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carvalho recommended being &quot;hopeful and optimistic&quot; that you will find &quot;someone you just naturally feel a connection with.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soletti, 5’10, met her 6’7 husband Juan Cabrera at a &quot;size matters&quot; speed dating event that she threw back in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the pair have a six-year-old daughter named Nola, who often comes to events and helps with check-in and handing out name tags. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m happy to say [that] I’m one of my own success stories,&quot; said Soletti. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
