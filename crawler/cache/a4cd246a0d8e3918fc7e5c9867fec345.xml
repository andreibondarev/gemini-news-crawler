                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chair lifts at an Italian ski resort in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Swiss Alps&lt;/a&gt; were captured on video twisting and turning after being blasted by sudden gusts of wind while at least two people were still riding in the chairs on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onlookers recorded video of the frightening incident at the Cervino Ski Paradise in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/italy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Breuil-Cervinia,&lt;/a&gt; a popular tourist resort at the foot of the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Crabtree, one skier who shared video, posted on social media that 10 chairs on the lift were damaged and taken out of service by the time the lift reopened the following day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnaby Dunning, an experienced skier who was stuck in a chair lift with a friend at the time, told ABC’s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; on Monday that wind conditions reached up to 70 miles per hour. The skier said he felt like he was in a washing machine and had &quot;multiple moments of total panic and fear.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/5-people-2-children-crushed-death-winds-topple-trees-poland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 PEOPLE, INCLUDING 2 CHILDREN, CRUSHED TO DEATH AFTER WINDS TOPPLE TREES IN POLAND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I never even knew chair lifts could rotate the way that they were rotating,&quot; Dunning said. &quot;You’re just getting thrown around all over the place.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/americans-stranded-norwegian-cruise-line-after-island-excursion-left-without-money-vital-meds-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMERICANS STRANDED BY NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE AFTER ISLAND EXCURSION, LEFT WITHOUT MONEY, VITAL MEDS: REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resort told the BBC in a statement that the ski lift was closed due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/weather&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;poor weather conditions&lt;/a&gt; and those still on the lift were the last skiers making their way to the upper station. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the skiers &quot;all reached their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;destination safely,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; the statement said per the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Three girls have been arrested and charged for allegedly beating a 64-year-old Washington, DC man to death in October 2023, police announced on Friday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Three young girls have been arrested and charged in connection with the death of a 64-year-old man in northwest Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metropolitan Police Department officers responded to the 6200 block of Georgia Avenue just before 1 a.m. on Oct. 17, 2023, for a report of a man down, according to a press release. Upon arrival, officers found Brown with trauma consistent with an assault. He died at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was just a quiet, nice, polite person. He didn’t bother anybody. That’s the type of person he was,&quot; a close family friend told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fox5dc.com/news/12-year-old-murder-suspect-injured-in-separate-shooting-in-dc-family-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;FOX 5 DC&lt;/a&gt;. Local reports said Brown was physically handicapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspects, whose names are being withheld due to their age, are accused of beating to death the man, who police identified as Reggie Brown. Video played in court Friday showed the beating, local NBC4 reported. A medical examiner&apos;s autopsy revealed he died of blunt force trauma and the manner of death was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ruled a homicide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/dc-suspect-tries-setting-union-stations-freedom-bell-fire-police-investigating&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC SUSPECT TRIES SETTING UNION STATION&apos;S FREEDOM BELL ON FIRE; POLICE INVESTIGATING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, a 13-year-old girl was arrested and charged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;second-degree murder&lt;/a&gt; in connection with Brown&apos;s death. On Friday, a 13-year-old girl and a 12-year-old girl were also arrested and charged with second-degree murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A relative of the 12-year-old girl charged with killing Brown told FOX 5 the girl was shot Friday morning inside her apartment, which is about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/washington-dc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;four blocks away&lt;/a&gt; from where Brown was murdered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/dc-business-owner-slams-city-leaders-out-control-crime-lack-courage-aggressive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC BUSINESS OWNER SLAMS CITY LEADERS FOR OUT-OF-CONTROL CRIME: &apos;LACK COURAGE&apos; TO &apos;BE MORE AGGRESSIVE&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She [is] going to come through. It’s just a lot going on right now,&quot; they said. &quot;This happened around 3 in the morning. I ain’t even get no sleep.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl is expected to survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metropolitan police say the case remains under investigation and the department is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information. Anyone with information about this case is asked to call the police at 202-727-9099. Anonymous information may be submitted to the department’s text tip line by sending a text message to 50411.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three suspects reportedly have long-standing truancy issues — one allegedly did not attend a single day of classes in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As early as this week, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser could propose a plan to hold parents in the district accountable if their children miss too many school days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some residents are hoping that addressing the district’s truancy issue could help reduce juvenile crime, which has skyrocketed. A report released by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education in November said that in the 2022-2023 school year, 60% of D.C. high school students were chronically absent, meaning they were absent either all day or part of the day at least 10% of school days.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>How 155,000 copies of ‘The Great Gatsby’ were pivotal for World War II soldiers and F Scott Fitzgerald</title>
                    
                    <description>&amp;quot;The Great Gatsby&amp;quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald wasn&amp;apos;t a widely popular book right away. Free editions given to World War II soldiers helped the book gain its success.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/lifestyle-books&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;classic piece of literature&lt;/a&gt; today that has been read by millions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book set on Long Island during the Jazz Age is a work read by English classes across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story told by narrator Nick Carraway about his wealthy, mysterious neighbor, Jay Gatsby, and his love for Daisy Buchanan wasn’t always one popular among critics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/classic-must-read-books&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 MUST-READ CLASSIC BOOKS THAT HAVE REMAINED POPULAR YEARS AFTER THEIR ORIGINAL PUBLICATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitzgerald’s earlier works, &quot;The Side of Paradise&quot; (1920) and &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot; (1922), were much better received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitzgerald never got to see the success of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; in his lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, when the book was a mere $2 to buy, there were fewer than 20,000 copies sold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very last royalty check Fitzgerald received for the work before his death on Dec. 21, 1940, was for $13.13, according to the Washington Post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/world-war-two&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; saw a huge boost in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the war, the United States government came up with a program in which they shipped out pocket-sized versions of books for soldiers to read in their downtime. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was one of the books chosen for this program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books chosen fell into a wide variety of genres, so there was something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a total of 1,324 titles published in the series, according to the Library of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 155,000 free Armed Service Editions of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; given to U.S. soldiers, according to the Library of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that was when the book saw a huge boost in popularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, there have been more than 25 million copies of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; sold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story has also been made for the big screen four times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/various-movie-adaptations-f-scott-fitzgeralds-great-gatsby-filmed-over-nearly-100-years&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;newest film version of the book&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular. The Baz Luhrmann-directed movie sees Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby, Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan, Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan and Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The View&quot; co-host &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/whoopi-goldberg-calls-out-audience-member-using-camera-during-view&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Whoopi Goldberg&lt;/a&gt; claimed Americans had &quot;short memory issues&quot; on Monday while discussing a question posed by Republicans about whether people felt &quot;better off&quot; than they were four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So why is it some people are having short memory issues? There are plenty of other reasons to feel good about where we actually are. Why isn’t that tracking?&quot; she asked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;daytime talk show&lt;/a&gt; segment, Goldberg criticized the question and said it was &quot;disrespectful to the American people.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Black people, we were not in this insanity of trying to figure out why our history’s no longer welcome in the educational system. Women were realizing something was happening. If you were coming from another country, if you were coming to this country to find a better life, you were not welcome. Listen. It wasn’t a good time for lots of people,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/the-view-co-host-joy-behar-unleashes-on-lack-of-checks-and-balances-in-government-the-system-is-rigged&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&apos;THE VIEW&apos; CO-HOST JOY BEHAR UNLEASHES ON &apos;LACK OF CHECKS AND BALANCES&apos; IN GOVERNMENT: &apos;THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All you have to do is ask, are we better off than we were? Ask the thousands of people who are no longer here. That’s how you know if we’re better off. Ask their families. Are they better off without their loved ones? What a stupid question. It’s a stupid question and disrespectful to the American people in my opinion, in my humble opinion.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin, who worked in the Trump administration, said Republicans were committing &quot;political malpractice&quot; by asking the question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She argued that while the economy was &quot;objectively doing better&quot; under Biden, people feel they had more money in their 401ks during the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/view-co-hosts-explode-biden-report-binary-choice-good-evil&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;‘THE VIEW’ CO-HOSTS EXPLODE OVER BIDEN REPORT: ‘A BINARY CHOICE BETWEEN EVIL AND GOOD’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunny Hostin criticized the former president and said the Democratic Party could do more to stress just how &quot;terrible&quot; the four years of Trump were&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think the Democrats need to do more in getting the message out that yes, we actually are better off right now because of all of the things that Biden has done, but I will say this, you know, while Trump may have, you know, came up with this Operation Warp Speed, which I don’t know why he came up with that term, I do believe that he is responsible for mishandling the pandemic so much that over a million Americans died including my in-laws, and it is in large part, because he had his son-in-law who shouldn’t have been in the White House in the first place, handling the response. Someone with absolutely no medical history – experience,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-half-voters-worse-off-2020&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;A Fox News poll&lt;/a&gt; from March found that just 22% of voters say they are better off than four years ago, while more than twice that many, 52%, say they are worse off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poll also found that 73% of voters rated the economy negatively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The co-hosts referenced the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the segment, and Ana Navarro said she was living with anxiety every day during the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In addition to the Covid issue, which is, you know, incredibly serious and sad and cost so many lives, I can tell you that I was getting death threats. I was, you know, living a level of anxiety that I didn’t realize until after Trump left, because every day I woke up wondering what scandal, what horrible thing was he going to tweet about? What international incident was he going to cause? I mean, I couldn’t be away from news. Now I’m like playing Words with Friends and Fishdom,&quot; Navarro said. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Sunday said Hamas fighters captured by IDF forces have painted a grim picture of the terror group.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Israeli Defense Minister&lt;/a&gt; Yoav Gallant on Sunday said Hamas terrorists captured by troops said &quot;the group is collapsing from within&quot; as Israel steps up its military offensive in the Gaza Strip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the last week or two, hundreds of terrorists have been captured and what they say about what happened to them tells the whole story. They say that Hamas is collapsing from within, the price they are paying is very heavy,&quot; Gallant said, The Times of Israel reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’re going to eliminate everyone who was involved in the events of October 7, the junior [officials], the senior ones and the very senior ones; those who were inside [Israel] or who gave instructions,&quot; he said, referring to the date of Palestinian terror group Hamas’s massive attack on Israel that started the ongoing conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/world-health-organization-silent-hamas-use-gaza-hospital-terror-hq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SILENT OVER HAMAS&apos; USE OF GAZA HOSPITAL AS TERROR HQ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Israel Defense Forces said over the weekend that its troops seized a cache of weapons concealed in the maternity ward of Shifa Hospital, where a raid on the facility to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense/wars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;target Hamas&lt;/a&gt; terrorists was entering its third week. Weapons found included mortars, explosive devices, sniper rifles, assault rifles, handguns and other military equipment hidden inside patient pillows and beds, according to the IDF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that troops would invade the city of Rafah in southern Gaza. The promise comes amid concerns from the Biden administration about Israeli military operations and the mounting civilian casualties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu, 74, said he had approved the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israels-netanyahu-rebuffs-us-plea-halt-rafah-offensive-tensions-rise-ahead-washington-talks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;IDF’s &quot;operational plan&quot; for Rafah&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, saying the force was &quot;prepared for the evacuation of the civilian population and for the provision of humanitarian assistance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/pro-palestinian-protesters-disrupt-berkeley-city-council-meeting-holocaust-remembrance-vote-end-israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS DISRUPT BERKELEY CITY COUNCIL MEETING, HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE VOTE: ‘END ISRAEL’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is the right thing both operationally and internationally,&quot; he said. &quot;This will take time but it will be done. We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hamas battalions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; there for one simple reason: There is no victory without entering Rafah and there is no victory without eliminating the Hamas battalions there.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu has said there can be no victory without a military ground offensive in Rafah, the southern Gaza city where more than half of the territory&apos;s population of 2.3 million now shelters after fleeing fighting elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden administration&lt;/a&gt; and Israel were expected to hold a virtual meeting Monday to discuss Rafah. Netanyahu had canceled a previous set of meetings in Washington after the U.S. abstained from a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire and the release of all hostages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House has said a military operation in Rafah could result in mass civilian casualties and exacerbate an already dire humanitarian crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Bradford Betz contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior leader in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps&amp;apos; Quds Force, reportedly has been killed by an airstrike in Syria.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The senior &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Iranian military commander&lt;/a&gt; who reportedly was killed Monday in a suspected Israeli airstrike in Syria has played a &quot;key role&quot; in the Islamic Republic’s support of Hezbollah, a Lebanese terrorist organization, the U.S. says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department, which sanctioned Mohammad Reza Zahedi in 2010, says he has &quot;acted as a liaison to Hezbollah and Syrian intelligence services and is reportedly charged with guaranteeing weapons shipments to Hezbollah.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zahedi was a senior leader in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps&apos; Quds Force, which also has been designated by the U.S. State Department as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;foreign terrorist organization.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The IRGC-QF is one of the Iranian regime’s primary organizations responsible for conducting covert lethal activities outside of Iran, including asymmetric and terrorist operations,&quot; according to the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). &quot;Iran views terrorism as a tool that it can use to support its efforts to deter and counter its perceived foes, assert leadership over Shia Muslims worldwide, and project power in the Middle East.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/senior-leader-irans-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-reportedly-killed-syria-strike&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SENIOR LEADER OF IRAN’S ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORPS REPORTEDLY KILLED IN SYRIA STRIKE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NCTC says the IRGC-QF &quot;targets U.S., Israeli, Saudi, and UAE interests, as well as Iranian dissident groups&quot; and is comprised of between 5,000 and 15,000 of the most loyal personnel from the broader Revolutionary Guard Corps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zahedi died Monday in an alleged Israeli airstrike that hit the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, a Lebanese security source told Reuters. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Israel has not confirmed&lt;/a&gt; its involvement in the attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, when asked about the reported strike, told reporters Monday that &quot;our team is looking into it.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israeli-troops-withdraw-from-shifa-hospital-gaza-idf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISRAELI TROOPS WITHDRAW FROM SHIFA HOSPITAL IN GAZA, IDF SAYS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital following the strike that &quot;it&apos;s likely that Zahedi was a critical part of the connective tissue between Iran&apos;s IRGC Quds Force and the Assad regime in Syria and Lebanese Hezbollah.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The former is Iran&apos;s oldest state-level ally, and the latter is Iran&apos;s most successful proxy organization,&quot; he said. &quot;The Assad regime in Syria is the literal bridge between Iran and Hezbollah.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taleblu said Zahedi gained military experience in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and also briefly was &quot;the head of IRGC Air Force as well as commander of Iran&apos;s IRGC Ground Forces.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iranian media outlets also are reporting that Zahedi was the chief Quds Force official in the Syrian and Lebanese theaters between the late 2000s to the late 2010s, according to Taleblu.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (AP) — The world’s largest democratic election could also be one of its most consequential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a population of over 1.4 billion people and close to 970 million voters, India’s general election pits &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/indian-prime-minister-narendra-modi-visits-kashmirs-main-city-discuss-development-projects&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Prime Minister Narendra Modi&lt;/a&gt;, an avowed Hindu nationalist, against a broad alliance of opposition parties that are struggling to play catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/indias-government-enact-controversial-citizenship-law-excluding-muslims-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INDIA&apos;S GOVERNMENT TO ENACT CONTROVERSIAL CITIZENSHIP LAW EXCLUDING MUSLIMS AHEAD OF ELECTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 73-year-old Modi first swept to power in 2014 on promises of economic development, presenting himself as an outsider cracking down on corruption. Since then, he has fused religion with politics in a formula that has attracted wide support from the country&apos;s majority Hindu population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India under Modi is a rising global power, but his rule has also been marked by rising unemployment, attacks by Hindu nationalists against minorities, particularly Muslims, and a shrinking space for dissent and free media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW DOES THE ELECTION WORK?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6-week-long general election starts on April 19 and results will be announced on June 4. The voters, who comprise over 10% of the world&apos;s population, will elect 543 members for the lower house of Parliament for a five-year term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The polls will be held in seven phases and ballots cast at more than a million polling stations. Each phase will last a single day with several constituencies across multiple states voting that day. The staggered polling allows the government to deploy tens of thousands of troops to prevent violence and transport election officials and voting machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India has a first-past-the-post multiparty electoral system in which the candidate who receives the most votes wins. To secure a majority, a party or coalition must breach the mark of 272 seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While voters in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/connecticut-becomes-last-states-allow-in-person-early-voting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere use paper ballots, India uses electronic voting machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO IS RUNNING?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party and his main challenger, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/indian-opposition-leader-rahul-gandhi-calls-indians-united-states-stand-democracy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rahul Gandhi&lt;/a&gt; of the Indian National Congress, represent Parliament’s two largest factions. Several other important regional parties are part of an opposition bloc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposition parties, which have been previously fractured, have united under a front called INDIA, or Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, to deny Modi a a third straight election victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alliance has fielded a single primary candidate in most constituencies. But it has been roiled by ideological differences and personality clashes, and has not yet decided on its candidate for prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most surveys suggest Modi is likely to win comfortably, especially after he opened a Hindu temple in northern Ayodhya city in January, which fulfilled his party’s long-held Hindu nationalist pledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another victory would cement Modi as one of the country&apos;s most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP clinched an absolute majority by sweeping 303 parliamentary seats. The Congress party managed only 52 seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT ARE THE BIG ISSUES?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, India has clung doggedly to its democratic convictions, largely due to free elections, an independent judiciary, a thriving media, strong opposition and peaceful transition of power. Some of these credentials have seen a slow erosion under Modi’s 10-year rule, with the polls seen as a test for the country’s democratic values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many watchdogs have now categorized India as a &quot;hybrid regime&quot; that is neither a full democracy nor a full autocracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The polls will also test the limits of Modi, a populist leader whose rise has seen increasing attacks against religious minorities, mostly Muslims. Critics accuse him of using a Hindu-first platform, endangers the country&apos;s secular roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Modi, the media, once viewed as vibrant and largely independent, have become more pliant and critical voices muzzled.Courts have largely bent to Modi’s will and given favorable verdicts in crucial cases. Centralization of executive power has strained India’s federalism. And federal agencies have bogged down top opposition leaders in corruption cases, which they deny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key issue is India&apos;s large economy, which is among the fastest growing in the world. It has helped India emerge as a global power and a counterweight to China. But even as India&apos;s growth soars by some measures, the Modi government has struggled to generate enough jobs for young Indians, and instead has relied on welfare programs like free food and housing to woo voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.N.&apos;s latest Asia-Pacific Human Development Report lists India among the top countries with high income and wealth inequality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>&apos;Common sense wave&apos; coming in November after NYPD officer&apos;s death, GOP candidate says</title>
                    
                    <description>House candidate Alison Esposito, R-N.Y., joined &amp;quot;Fox &amp;amp; Friends First&amp;quot; to discuss her race in a swing district and the need to hold violent criminals accountable.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A 25-year NYPD veteran running for Congress is hopeful that a long-overdue turning point for law enforcement is on the horizon following the murder of NYPD officer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/wife-slain-nypd-officer-jonathan-diller-delivers-emotional-eulogy-thousands-attend-funeral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jonathan Diller&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[It&apos;s] not rocket science. It&apos;s 101. Hold criminals responsible for their actions,&quot; New York congressional candidate Alison Esposito told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Fox &amp;amp; Friends First&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The government&apos;s number one job is to keep their people safe and then get out of their lives,&quot; she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-angers-law-enforcement-skipping-nypd-officers-wake-favor-fundraiser-adjust-schedule&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN ANGERS LAW ENFORCEMENT BY SKIPPING NYPD OFFICER&apos;S WAKE IN FAVOR OF FUNDRAISER: ‘ADJUST YOUR SCHEDULE’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diller&apos;s widow, Stephanie, delivered an emotional eulogy, Saturday, demanding change as thousands gathered to honor the 31-year-old fatally shot during a traffic stop by a suspect with a lengthy criminal history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How many more police officers and how many more families need to make the ultimate sacrifice before we start protecting them?&quot; Stephanie Diller pleaded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esposito said the heartbreaking words were reminiscent of two years ago, when the widow of fallen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/remembering-nypd-officer-jason-rivera-nyc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York City Det. Jason Rivera&lt;/a&gt; tearfully remarked that the system &quot;continues to fail us.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dominique Rivera begged our feckless leaders to do something about bail reform, to do something about holding criminals accountable. And it went on deaf ears. It fell on deaf ears. I pray that this is the change, the wake-up call that this city needs,&quot; Esposito said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esposito left her decades-long law enforcement career to run for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; lieutenant governor in 2022 alongside GOP gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin. She is now looking to unseat Democrat Rep. Pat Ryan in swing District 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a deep blue state, but it&apos;s really a red state with blue dots. And I submit that the last one and this coming one isn&apos;t a red wave. It is a red, white and blue wave. It is a common sense wave. This is Democrats, Republicans, Independents standing up and saying enough is enough. We want our public safety. We want to back our law enforcement first.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guy Rivera, the 34-year-old suspect accused of opening fire on Diller and his partner in Queens, has 21 prior arrests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We need more work in education,&quot; Esposito continued. &quot;We need more work making sure that children have things to do rather than turning to crime. But once the criminal is there, once they are violent repeat offenders, that&apos;s not when bail reform and criminal justice reform is supposed to take effect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Nearly 41,000 people were killed on U.S. roadways in 2023, a 3.6% drop in traffic deaths year-over-year; traffic deaths dropped for the seventh straight quarter in Q4 of 2023.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;DETROIT (AP) — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/auto/u-s-traffic-deaths-record-42915-2021&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.S. traffic deaths&lt;/a&gt; fell 3.6% last year, but still, almost 41,000 people were killed on the nation&apos;s roadways, according to full-year estimates by safety regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-safety-agency-require-automatic-emergency-braking-heavy-trucks-buses&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&lt;/a&gt; said it was the second year in a row that fatalities decreased. The agency also released final numbers for 2022 on Monday, saying that 42,514 people died in crashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/12-year-old-killed-wrong-way-crash-sister-speaks-unlicensed-illegal-immigrant-drivers-arrest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12-YEAR-OLD KILLED IN WRONG-WAY CRASH: SISTER SPEAKS OUT AFTER UNLICENSED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT DRIVER&apos;S ARREST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NHTSA Deputy Administrator Sophie Shulman said that traffic deaths declined in the fourth quarter of last year, marking the seventh straight quarterly drop that started with the second quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The declines come even though people are driving more. Federal Highway Administration estimates show that Americans drove 67.5 billion more miles last year than the previous year, a 2.1% increase. The death rate per 100 million miles driven fell to 1.26 last year, down from 1.33 in 2022, NHTSA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities have said that even with a decline, the number of deaths is still too high. Shulman blamed the problem in part on distracted driving. In 2022, an estimated 3,308 people were killed in crashes that involved distracted drivers, while 289,310 were injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost 20% of people killed in distracted driving crashes were people outside of vehicles including pedestrians, bicyclists and others, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Distracted driving is extremely dangerous,&quot; she said while kicking off a rebranded campaign against it called &quot;Put the Phone Away or Pay.&quot; The agency will start an advertising campaign this month, and law enforcement officers will crack down on the behavior in a campaign from April 4 to 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffic deaths spiked in 2021 with a 10.5% increase over 2020 as people started driving more as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-calls-covid-commission-powers-refuse-admit-they-got-it-wrong&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; started to ease. That was the highest number since 2005 and the largest percentage increase since 1975.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, authorities blamed the increase on speeding and more reckless behavior, as well as distracted driving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the increase in crash deaths then was due to people driving more as the coronavirus pandemic waned. NHTSA reported that the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled increased 2.2% to 1.37 in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Austria says it must deter Russian infiltration after allegations of spying emerge</title>
                    
                    <description>After a former Austrian intelligence officer was arrested for allegedly spying for Russia, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said Austria needs to boost its security to prevent Russian infiltration.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;VIENNA (AP) — The arrest in recent days of a former Austrian intelligence officer on serious allegations of spying for Russia suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/austria-seeks-explanation-from-germany-about-spying-reports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; needs to boost its security to thwart Russian infiltration, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The allegations against Egisto Ott, who worked for a now-defunct intelligence agency and whose arrest was announced Friday, are &quot;grave&quot; and have prompted Nehammer to call a meeting next week of Austria’s National Security Council, the chancellor said. Ott has denied wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/austrian-ex-officer-suspected-of-spying-for-russia-since-90s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUSTRIAN EX-OFFICER SUSPECTED OF SPYING FOR RUSSIA SINCE 90S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On the one hand, these allegations have to be addressed by the judiciary. On the other hand, an evaluation and clarification of the security situation of the republic is needed,&quot; Nehammer said in a statement. &quot;We have to avoid having Russian spy networks threaten our country by infiltrating or instrumentalizing political parties and networks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nehammer said he would convene the National Security Council on Tuesday of next week. The council, which consists of government ministers as well as members of all political parties, is a key advisory panel on matters of security and defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/vienna-court-convicts-alleged-accomplices-2020-islamic-state-shooting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; Criminal Court on Monday approved a 14-day extension for holding Ott in custody on the charges against him. The Vienna public prosecutor’s office declined to provide details about the spying allegations, but said that they relate to &quot;abuse of office&quot; and were &quot;detrimental to Austria.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain has arrested five Bulgarian citizens last year and a sixth one in February and has charged them with allegedly being members of a Russian spy network working together with Jan Marsalek, the fugitive former chief operating officer of Wirecard, the German payment processing company that collapsed in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joint reporting by Der Spiegel, German public broadcaster ZDF, the Austrian newspaper Der Standard and the Russian investigative platform The Insider said last month that Ott and another former Austrian intelligence officer are suspected of having spied on potential targets in Europe and having passed the information to Jan Marsalek, who they allege has had connections to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/moscow-attack-shows-putins-grip-russia-not-nearly-as-tight-as-we-think-says-ex-us-ambassador-ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; intelligence since at least 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also reported that Ott and his colleague allegedly helped Marsalek secretly escape from Austria in a private jet in 2020 after the Wirecard collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ott rejected the accusations against him as baseless in a recent interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been previous allegations against Ott. In 2017, Western intelligence agencies warned their Austrian counterparts about Ott potentially spying for Russia. Ott was suspended from his job at the BVT in 2017 and was briefly arrested in 2021, but he was released again after a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austria expelled two Russian diplomats from Russia’s embassy in Vienna last month in what Austrian officials said was related to spying.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Migrants in Iowa consider leaving over a bill that could see some arrested and deported</title>
                    
                    <description>Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds is expected to sign a bill that would allow for some migrants to be arrested and deported by the state; immigrant and Latino groups are organizing meetings to discuss.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — A bill in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/iowa-travel-guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; that would allow the state to arrest and deport some migrants is stoking anxiety among immigrant communities, leaving some to wonder: &quot;Should I leave Iowa?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation, which is expected to be signed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/iowa-gov-reynolds-desantis-aim-trump-over-misleading-tv-ad&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Gov. Kim Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;, would make it a state crime for a person to be in Iowa if previously denied admission to or removed from the United States. It mirrors part of a Texas law that is currently blocked in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/midwest-state-verge-defying-biden-texas-style-bill-combat-illegal-immigration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIDWEST STATE ON VERGE OF DEFYING BIDEN WITH TEXAS-STYLE BILL TO COMBAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across Iowa, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/iowa-latinos-emerging-as-small-but-potentially-significant-political-force&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Latino&lt;/a&gt; and immigrant community groups are organizing informational meetings and materials to try to answer people&apos;s questions. They’re also asking local and county law enforcement agencies for official statements, as well as face-to-face meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As 80 people gathered in a Des Moines public library community room last week, community organizer Fabiola Schirrmeister pulled written questions out of a tin can. In Spanish, one asked: &quot;Is it safe to call the police?&quot; Another asked: &quot;Can Iowa police ask me about my immigration status?&quot; And: &quot;What happens if I’m racially profiled?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erica Johnson, executive director of Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, the organization hosting the meeting, sighed when one person asked: &quot;Should I leave Iowa?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Entiendo el sentido,&quot; she said. I understand the sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schirrmeister, who hosts a local Spanish-language radio show, explained how long organizers have worked to build a bridge with law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s sad how it’s going to hurt the trust between local enforcement, pro-immigrant organizations and the immigrant communities,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Des Moines Police Chief Dana Wingert told The Associated Press in an email that immigration status does not factor into the department&apos;s work to keep the community safe, and he said it would be &quot;disingenuous and contradictory&quot; to incorporate it at the same time law enforcement has been working to eliminate such bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m not interested, nor are we equipped, funded or staffed to take on additional responsibilities that historically have never been a function of local law enforcement,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Iowa and across the country, Republican leaders have rallied around the refrain that &quot;every state is a border state&quot; as they accuse President Joe Biden of neglecting his responsibilities to enforce federal immigration law. That’s led Republican governors to send troops to support Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s Operation Lone Star, and legislatures to propose a variety of state-level strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iowa’s lawmakers advanced the measure to address what one lawmaker called a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; posed to Iowans by some migrants crossing the southern border. Republican Rep. Steve Holt acknowledged questions of constitutionality around the bill but ultimately argued that Iowa has &quot;the right, the duty and the moral obligation to act to protect our citizens and our sovereignty.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If we end up in a court battle with the federal government, should this pass, bring it on,&quot; Holt said during a subcommittee meeting in February. &quot;I think it’s time for every state to stand up and say … ‘we’ve had enough. We will defend our people.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas law is stalled in court, after a challenge from the U.S. Department of Justice, which says it conflicts with the federal government’s immigration authority. The department did not immediately comment on the Iowa bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iowa legislation, like the Texas law, could mean criminal charges for people who have outstanding deportation orders or who have previously been removed from or denied admission to the U.S. Once in custody, migrants could either agree to a judge’s order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge’s order must identify the transportation method for leaving the U.S. and a law enforcement officer or Iowa agency to monitor migrants&apos; departures. Those who don’t leave could face rearrest under more serious charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill in Iowa faces the same questions of implementation and enforcement as the Texas law, since deportation is a &quot;complicated, expensive and often dangerous&quot; federal process, said immigration law expert Huyen Pham of Texas A&amp;amp;M School of Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How are Iowa law enforcement agencies going to determine if someone has entered Iowa in violation of an immigration order?&quot; Pham asked. She said questions remain about which country a detained person would be sent back to, how they would get there and how agencies would communicate with those countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deportations are a binational process, she said, meaning the federal government negotiates with the governments of other countries. Disjointed immigration policy state-by-state could threaten those international relationships, Pham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico has already said that it would reject any state or local government enforcement of immigration laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iowa State Patrol, as well as representatives of multiple police departments and county sheriff’s offices across the state, declined to comment on the bill before it is signed into law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shawn Ireland, president of the Iowa State Sheriff’s and Deputies Association and a deputy sheriff in Linn County, said in an email that law enforcement officials would consult with county attorneys for guidance if the bill becomes law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ireland added that community-police relations are a priority, and law enforcement’s focus &quot;is not on looking for people who came to this country illegally and are not committing crimes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manny Galvez, leader of the Escucha Mi Voz (Hear My Voice) community group based in the rural city of West Liberty, said the bill has galvanized immigrant communities, including some that are in harder-to-reach areas of Iowa, to send the message that immigration is a human issue and that the state’s meatpacking plants, cornfields and construction projects rely on immigrant labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers advancing a bill like this one are disconnected from that reality, Galvez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Criminalizing the immigrant community is not the answer,&quot; he said. &quot;We tell people: ‘Don’t be afraid. No tengan miedo. We are going to keep fighting this.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Luis Duran-Ruano, 31, was shot and mortally wounded by Indianapolis police Sunday night, following a standoff with a SWAT team on the city&amp;apos;s west side.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Indianapolis police fatally shot a man after he fired shots following a standoff with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;SWAT team&lt;/a&gt;, police said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man was taken to a hospital Sunday night where he later died, police said. He was identified as Luis Duran-Ruano, 31, by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Marion County Coroner&apos;s Office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police were called to the city&apos;s west side around 7:30 p.m. about a man reportedly firing shots into the air, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/seven-juveniles-wounded-downtown-indianapolis-shooting-police-say&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEVEN JUVENILES WOUNDED IN DOWNTOWN INDIANAPOLIS SHOOTING, POLICE SAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officers tried to stop the man from driving away in a car but he led them on a brief pursuit that ended outside a home. The man then got out of the car armed with a gun, which he held to his head, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A SWAT team was called to the scene and a sergeant began communicating with the man, trying to get him to put the gun down. But after about an hour, police said the man began walking away from the home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When SWAT team officers fired bean bag rounds, the suspect then fired gunshots and three officers returned fire, fatally wounding the man, police said. Officers recovered a gun at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shooting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance/investigations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;will be investigated&lt;/a&gt; by an IMPD Critical Incident Response Team and internal affairs. The officers who fired their guns have been placed on administrative leave, police said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A firefighter collapsed and died while battling a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/wildfire&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;3-acre wildfire&lt;/a&gt; in southwestern Virginia, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/massive-5-alarm-fire-breaks-brooklyn-catholic-church-during-easter-sunday-services&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MASSIVE 5-ALARM FIRE BREAKS OUT AT BROOKLYN CATHOLIC CHURCH DURING EASTER SUNDAY SERVICES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firefighter James C. Ward collapsed Saturday while working with a crew to extinguish the fire that broke out in Scott County, the Virginia Department of Forestry said in a statement posted on social media. Ward was taken to Holston Valley Medical Center in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kingsport, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, but he did not recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ward, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/virginia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Scott County&lt;/a&gt; resident, was an experienced part-time firefighter who had worked with the agency since 1998, officials said. He leaves behind a wife and son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Please keep James’ loved ones and his firefighter family in your thoughts and prayers,&quot; State Forester Rob Farrell said in a statement. &quot;And remember, everything you do to prevent wildfires helps protect our brave first responders.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blaze was contained Saturday. The cause is under investigation, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A small business owner is standing up for the local community in Oakland, California, after she revealed that her store was vandalized and broken into on Easter.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A small business owner in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Oakland, California&lt;/a&gt;, revealed that her store was vandalized and broken into on Easter Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We need the city to take action and prevent this from happening to us,&quot; owner Taylor Jay said, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/oakland-retail-store-burglarized-owner-announces/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;KRON4 report&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;This is not fair. This is Easter Sunday, this is a Sunday we should all be spending time with our loved ones and enjoying this day, not having to clean up glass.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theft occurred at about 5:30 in the morning, KRON4 reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/san-fran-reparations-stalling-due-money-legal-issues-experts-grill-city-apology-not-enough&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SAN FRAN REPARATIONS EFFORT STALLING DUE TO MONEY, LEGAL ISSUES, EXPERTS GRILL CITY FOR APOLOGY: ‘NOT ENOUGH&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;After breaking the glass on the front door, a security video shows a man coming inside the store and helping himself to a wide array of goods,&quot; the outlet reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Being a small business in Oakland and how tough things have already been for us, for small businesses in general, it doesn&apos;t feel good. It doesn&apos;t feel good at all,&quot; Jay said. &quot;It&apos;s really devastating, it&apos;s really heartbreaking. It&apos;s very discouraging.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The robber reportedly stole iPads, phones, clothing and thousands of dollars in goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He even used our suitcases and packed our inventory in the suitcases,&quot; Jay said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I feel like this [affects] all of our businesses,&quot; the business owner added. &quot;Your business is my business, my business is yours, and we should be in it in the right way. We have to support one another to be here and we have to speak about it vocally.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bay-area-city-install-480-surveillance-cameras-anti-crime-bid-newsom-announces&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BAY AREA CITY TO INSTALL 480 SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS IN ANTI-CRIME BID, NEWSOM ANNOUNCES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing group of business owners in the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/fox-news-california&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bay Area&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are declaring that they no longer want to pay taxes after a slew of robberies and thefts made them feel like the city wasn&apos;t doing enough to protect them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses in Oakland, California, have faced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;thefts and attacks&lt;/a&gt; in recent months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re scared for our lives,&quot; Cybelle&apos;s Pizza manager Nestor Sanchez said, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ktvu.com/news/oakland-business-owners-frustrated-with-crime-and-may-not-pay-taxes-in-protest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;KTVU report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Now, Dimond District is not the same as the years I had been working.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oakland Police Department and the City of Oakland did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>James Patterson&apos;s new true crime series to spotlight three riveting unsolved murder mysteries</title>
                    
                    <description>Lauren Petterson, president of Fox Nation, announced the debut of a new three-part true crime series hosted by acclaimed author James Patterson on Monday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new true crime series made its &lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox Nation debut&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, with the goal to immerse viewers in three riveting unsolved investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;multi-part series &lt;/a&gt;will explore three homicide cases, pulling in interviews from those closest to the incidents – ranging from friends and family to crime experts – to give subscribers a well-rounded scope of each investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was totally gripped by these cases. The fact that they are real-life stories – and that we may help bring justice to the victims and their families – is very special,&quot; said Lauren Petterson, president of Fox Nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/sean-larkins-crime-cam-24-7-renews-second-season-putting-citizens-heart-crime-fighting&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEAN LARKIN&apos;S ‘CRIME CAM 24/7’ RENEWS FOR SECOND SEASON, PUTTING CITIZENS AT THE HEART OF CRIME-FIGHTING&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Petterson announced &quot;Unsolved with James Patterson&apos;s&quot; debut on Monday, noting that critically acclaimed author and crime expert James Patterson will host the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterson holds a long list of feats. He was named the bestselling author of all-time by &lt;i&gt;Publisher’s Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, published over 260 New York Times bestsellers, created the acclaimed &quot;Alex Cross&quot; series, among other popular and upcoming projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has also published a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;non-fiction bestsellers&lt;/a&gt; about famous personalities and first responders. He received the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox Nation &quot;Back the Blue Award&quot;&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 for his work supporting law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In announcing the new Fox Nation series on Monday, Petterson said, &quot;For decades, James Patterson has captivated the country with his bestselling titles, and we are thrilled to bring his incredible talents in storytelling and suspense to Fox Nation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-angers-law-enforcement-skipping-nypd-officers-wake-favor-fundraiser-adjust-schedule&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN ANGERS LAW ENFORCEMENT BY SKIPPING NYPD OFFICER&apos;S WAKE IN FAVOR OF FUNDRAISER: ‘ADJUST YOUR SCHEDULE’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unsolved with James Patterson&quot; will lead off with a deep dive into the case of Nanette Krentel, a Louisiana pre-school teacher and wife of the local fire chief whose apparent unease about something unclear seemed warranted when her home went up in flames and her body was recovered among the ashes with a gunshot wound to the head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Episode two breaks down the case of Elizabeth Salgado of Utah, who recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/location-mexico&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;moved from Mexico &lt;/a&gt;to join the Mormon Church. Weeks after the change, she disappeared, only to be found in a canyon years later. Testimonies from her family could help shed some light on what happened exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/ultimate-evil-ultimate-innocence-mind-idaho-murder-suspect-bryan-kohberger&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;‘ULTIMATE EVIL MEETING ULTIMATE INNOCENCE:’ INSIDE THE MIND OF IDAHO MURDER SUSPECT BRYAN KOHBERGER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final episode explores the unsolved case of Brian Egg, a San Franciscan known to open his home to people in need. He went missing after several strange occurrences, and his dismembered body was later found inside his home in a fish tank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about these cases, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;subscribe to Fox Nation&lt;/a&gt; and begin streaming &quot;Unsolved with James Patterson.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SUBSCRIBE TO FOX NATION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Rare human case of highly contagious bird flu confirmed in Texas</title>
                    
                    <description>The CDC announced Monday that a person in Texas has tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, otherwise known as H5N1 bird flu.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Monday that a person in Texas has tested positive for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;highly pathogenic avian influenza,&lt;/a&gt; otherwise known as H5N1 bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This person had exposure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;dairy cattle in Texas&lt;/a&gt; presumed to be infected with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses. The patient reported eye redness (consistent with conjunctivitis), as their only symptom, and is recovering,&quot; the CDC said in a statement. &quot;The patient was told to isolate and is being treated with an antiviral drug for flu.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC said this is the second case of a human testing positive for H5N1 in the United States, after a previous case was observed in Colorado in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This infection does not change the H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which CDC considers to be low,&quot; it added. &quot;However, people with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/us-tuberculosis-cases-2023-highest-level-decade-cdc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US TUBERCULOSIS CASES IN 2023 WERE AT HIGHEST LEVEL IN A DECADE, CDC SAYS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were reported to be infected with bird flu – and federal agriculture officials later confirmed infections in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Michigan dairy herd&lt;/a&gt; that had recently received cows from Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bird flu was first identified as a threat to people during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong, according to the Associated Press. More than 460 people have died in the past two decades from bird flu infections, the World Health Organization says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/puerto-rico-health-officials-declare-dengue-fever-public-health-emergency-more-than-500-cases-reported&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PUERTO RICO HEALTH OFFICIALS DECLARE DENGUE FEVER A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas officials did not identify the newly infected person, nor release any details about what brought them in contact with the cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC said it is &quot;working with state health departments to continue to monitor workers who may have been in contact with infected or potentially infected birds/animals and test those people who develop symptoms.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Human illnesses with H5N1 bird flu have ranged from mild (e.g., eye infection, upper respiratory symptoms) to severe illness (e.g., pneumonia) that have resulted in death in other countries,&quot; the CDC also said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>White House calls squatting a &apos;local issue&apos; that governments must address</title>
                    
                    <description>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday said local governments must address the issue of squatters seizing the property of homeowners.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The White House is calling the squatting trend in which strangers seize and live in a homeowner&apos;s property against their wishes a &quot;local issue&quot; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;local governments&lt;/a&gt; must address themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday whether Americans need to be worried about squatters and where President Biden stands on the issue as horror stories continue to make headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My understanding is that this is obviously a local issue,&quot; Jean-Pierre said. &quot;We are certainly tracking that issue. The rights of property owners and renters must be protected.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And we believe that ultimately what needs to happen is that the local government needs to make sure that they address this, and they take action,&quot; the press secretary continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/squatter-scam-ends-florida-desantis-sheriff-tout-new-crackdown-straight-jail&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘SQUATTER SCAM’ ENDS IN FLORIDA AS DESANTIS, SHERIFF TOUT NEW CRACKDOWN: ‘STRAIGHT TO JAIL’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jean-Pierre said all Americans in communities across the country want the same thing: &quot;They want their families to be safe and that’s what we want as well.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked whether Biden would support a law like one taking effect in Florida that allows homeowners to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;call police&lt;/a&gt; on squatters, Jean-Pierre said she would not address hypotheticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What I can say is that this is ultimately a local issue, and it’s critical that local governments address this,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/anti-squatting-professional-celebrates-florida-ban-other-state-laws-frustrate-homeowners&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANTI-SQUATTING ‘PROFESSIONAL&apos; CELEBRATES FLORIDA BAN AS OTHER STATE LAWS FRUSTRATE HOMEOWNERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ron-desantis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis&lt;/a&gt; signed a bill last week that granted state law enforcement officials the power to remove offenders and increase penalties for squatters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes as property owners nationwide complain about their homes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/squatters-sue-good-samaritan-trash-property-he-allowed-temporary-free-stays&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;being seized by strangers&lt;/a&gt; and the limited options to take back what is rightfully theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Florida law is set to go into effect on July 1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Rankin County, Mississippi Sheriff&amp;apos;s deputies fatally shot a man who fired a gun in their direction Sunday afternoon, according to the state Department of Public Safety.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sheriff&apos;s deputies in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/mississippi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;central Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; shot and killed a man who fired a gun toward them, the state Department of Public Safety said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/louisiana-man-arrested-charged-deadly-mississippi-bus-shooting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOUISIANA MAN ARRESTED, CHARGED IN DEADLY MISSISSIPPI BUS SHOOTING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shooting happened around 4 p.m. Sunday in the Rankin County town of Florence. Deputies with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rankin County Sheriff’s Office&lt;/a&gt; were responding to a call about a person threatening family members at a home, according to a Department of Public Safety news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When deputies arrived, the man fired his weapon at the deputies, who returned fire. The man was taken to a hospital and was pronounced dead, the news release said. The deputies involved were not injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is examining the case, as it does with most shootings by or of law enforcement officers. Following its investigation, the Bureau will share its findings with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;state Attorney General’s Office&lt;/a&gt;, which can choose to pursue further action if legal violations are uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Argentina and Colombia have agreed to end a diplomatic spat between their respective presidents: Javier Milei, a libertarian, and Gustavo Petro, a leftist.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/regions/south-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Argentina and Colombia&lt;/a&gt; have agreed to end a diplomatic spat that escalated over right-wing Argentine President Javier Milei’s visceral attack on his leftist counterpart in Colombia last week, prompting the country to order the expulsion of Argentine diplomats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement late Sunday, the foreign ministries of the two Latin American nations said they &quot;have taken concrete steps to overcome any differences and strengthen this relationship.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia said its ambassador that it had summoned from Buenos Aires would return there, and the Argentine government said its foreign minister would visit Bogotá. Colombia also stepped back from its threat to expel Argentine diplomats, saying it would approve Argentina’s newly appointed ambassador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/colombias-largest-criminal-group-accepts-presidents-offer-broker-peace-deal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLOMBIA&apos;S LARGEST CRIMINAL GROUP ACCEPTS PRESIDENT&apos;S OFFER TO BROKER PEACE DEAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions between Argentina&apos;s Milei and Colombian President Gustavo Petro have repeatedly erupted into bitter quarrels since Milei, a brash right-wing economist and former TV personality, burst onto the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-politics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;world stage&lt;/a&gt; last year. Past sharp exchanges include Milei calling Petro &quot;a murderous communist,&quot; and describing socialists as &quot;human excrement.&quot; Petro retorted that &quot;this is what Hitler said.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, the contentious war of words between the populist presidents began with Milei branding Petro a &quot;terrorist murderer&quot; in an interview last week with CNN, a reference to Petro&apos;s past as a member of a left-wing guerrilla group. In response, Petro accused Milei on social media of isolating Argentina diplomatically and increasing its poverty rate with his libertarian policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milei and Petro come from opposite political poles. Petro won the presidency with pledges to create social programs to aid Colombia’s long-neglected poor, while Milei — a self-described anarcho-capitalist — promised to slash government spending while eliminating ministries and costly programs as a means to rein in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy/inflation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;triple-digit inflation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet both leaders rocketed to power with promises of radical change stemming from voters’ frustration with establishments that they say long have failed to address deep-rooted poverty and inequality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Sean &amp;apos;Diddy&amp;apos; Combs returned to Instagram, posting a photo of his young daughter, days after his homes were raided by Homeland Security. The rapper strategically disabled comments.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-accused-male-music-producer-sexual-assault&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs&lt;/a&gt; returned to social media on Easter Sunday, posting adorable photos of his young daughter, nearly one week after several of his properties were raided by Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The embattled rapper strategically disabled comments on his Instagram post, wishing followers a Happy Easter from his 1-year-old daughter, Love. Combs has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/kids&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;six older children&lt;/a&gt;, none of whom were featured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diddy had previously been lying low after several of his properties were raided last Monday, resurfacing at his Miami mansion days later. On Easter, he was photographed on his property engaged in a phone call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-lawsuit-names-50-cents-ex-girlfriend-one-music-moguls-alleged-sex-workers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEAN &apos;DIDDY&apos; COMBS LAWSUIT NAMES 50 CENT&apos;S EX-GIRLFRIEND AS ONE OF MUSIC MOGUL&apos;S ALLEGED SEX WORKERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source told People magazine that Combs is &quot;keeping his cool,&quot; amid the ongoing investigation, focusing his energy on his kids. &quot;He&apos;s been in Miami with his children,&quot; the source revealed. &quot;It&apos;s a stressful situation for him, but he&apos;s keeping his cool.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He&apos;s not the type to let any drama affect his children. He wants his children to be worry-free and happy. He has trust in his legal team.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C5MeEg2vbRM/?img_index=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APP USERS CLICK HERE TO VIEW INSTAGRAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the raids, a U.S. official confirmed to Fox News that they were connected to a federal human trafficking investigation, although it&apos;s unclear if Diddy is the target of the federal agents&apos; investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Diddy&apos;s attorney issued a statement denouncing the raid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yesterday, there was a gross overuse of military-level force as search warrants were executed at Mr. Combs’ residences. There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated. Mr. Combs was never detained but spoke to and cooperated with authorities. Despite media speculation, neither Mr. Combs nor any of his family members have been arrested nor has their ability to travel been restricted in any way,&quot; Aaron Dyer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This unprecedented ambush — paired with an advanced, coordinated media presence — leads to a premature rush to judgment of Mr. Combs and is nothing more than a witch hunt based on meritless accusations made in civil lawsuits. There has been no finding of criminal or civil liability with any of these allegations. Mr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combs, 54, is also the subject of a lawsuit filed by &quot;Lil Rod&quot; Jones Jr., a producer on Combs&apos; latest studio album, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/music&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Love Album: Off the Grid.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Jones Jr. filed a lawsuit in February accusing the rapper of sexually assaulting him and forcing him to perform sex acts with prostitutes, in documents obtained by Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the filing, Combs&apos; lawyer disputed Jones Jr.&apos;s claims, calling them &quot;pure fiction.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Florida police officers complete grocery delivery after arresting delivery driver</title>
                    
                    <description>Two police officers in Florida decided to finish the job of a grocery delivery driver after arresting him last week, doorbell camera video shows.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two Florida police officers went above and beyond the call of duty when they were seen on camera delivering groceries to customers after arresting their delivery driver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The encounter took place in Titusville on March 26, homeowner Joe Neu confirmed. The video he shared on social media has quickly spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hello, uh, you ordered groceries?&quot; a female officer can be seen asking in doorbell camera footage shared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/florida-police-officer-delivers-grocery-order-following-arrest-of-fugitive-delivery-driver&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;FOX 35 Orlando.&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Yes,&quot; the woman who answered the door said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Your driver got arrested, so we&apos;re delivering your groceries,&quot; the officer responded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/bodycam-video-shows-nypd-officers-spring-action-pull-man-subway-tracks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BODYCAM VIDEO SHOWS NYPD OFFICERS SPRING INTO ACTION TO PULL MAN FROM SUBWAY TRACKS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The female officer was then joined by a male officer, who walked bag after bag into the house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My dad was a police officer when I was growing up, so I have the utmost respect for them, so when I saw that, it was wonderful to see,&quot; Neu said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Titusville police arrested suspect Richard Robertson, 40, who was wanted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;felony charges&lt;/a&gt; in Texas and Florida, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by FOX 35. He was pulled over after officers spotted his car, and was arrested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/george-mason-university-police-sergeant-arrests-doordash-driver-makes-delivery-himself&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY POLICE SERGEANT ARRESTS DOORDASH DRIVER, MAKES THE DELIVERY HIMSELF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robertson&apos;s total bond amount was set at $26,000, according to online arrest records. His next court date is set for May 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Titusville Police were successful in the arrest of a wanted felon off the city streets,&quot; a statement to FOX 35 read. &quot;However, we remain compassionate and appreciative of our citizens, and we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/good-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;happy to complete the delivery&lt;/a&gt; of paid groceries to a valued community member.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;It is unknown which delivery platform Robertson was working for at the time of his arrest. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Titusville police&lt;/a&gt; did not immediately respond to a Fox News request for more information.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Russian-American journalist to remain in custody for 2 more months following court order</title>
                    
                    <description>Alsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist, has been ordered to remain in custody for another two months pending her investigation and trial after being arrested on Oct. 18.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A court in Russia on Monday ordered a detained Russian-American journalist to be held in jail for two more months pending investigation and trial, in a further step in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Kremlin’s crackdown&lt;/a&gt; on dissent and free speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alsu Kurmasheva, an editor for the U.S. government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Tatar-Bashkir service, was taken into custody on Oct. 18 and charged with failing to register as a foreign agent while collecting information about the Russian military. Later, she was also charged with spreading &quot;false information&quot; about the Russian military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;court in Tatarstan&lt;/a&gt; on Monday ordered her to remain behind bars at least until June 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/second-american-journalist-detained-russia-this-year-evan-gershkovich&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SECOND AMERICAN JOURNALIST DETAINED IN RUSSIA THIS YEAR AFTER EVAN GERSHKOVICH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurmasheva, who holds U.S. and Russian citizenship and lives in Prague with her husband and two daughters, could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted, according to RFE/RL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told reporters in the courtroom on Monday that she wasn&apos;t doing &quot;very well physically&quot; and that some of her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;medical conditions&lt;/a&gt; have flared up in detention. &quot;Living conditions are very bad, I have no way of taking care of my health,&quot; she said, adding that medical assistance in the detention center was &quot;minimal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian authorities have intensified a crackdown on Kremlin critics and independent journalists after President Vladimir Putin sent troops to Ukraine in February 2022, using legislation that effectively criminalized any public expression about the conflict that deviates from the Kremlin line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurmasheva was the second U.S. journalist detained in Russia last year, after Wall Street Journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-says-he-working-secure-release-evan-gershkovich-1-year-anniversary-detention-russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;reporter Evan Gershkovich&lt;/a&gt; was arrested on espionage charges in March. Gershkovich and his employer have rejected the charges, and the U.S. authorities designated him wrongfully detained. He has spent a year in custody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurmasheva was initially stopped on June 2 at Kazan International Airport after traveling to Russia the previous month to visit her ailing elderly mother. Officials confiscated her U.S. and Russian passports and fined her for failing to register her U.S. passport. She was waiting for her passports to be returned when she was arrested on new charges in October. RFE/RL has called for her release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFE/RL was told by Russian authorities in 2017 to register as a foreign agent, but it has challenged Moscow’s use of foreign agent laws in the European Court of Human Rights. The organization has been fined millions of dollars by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
