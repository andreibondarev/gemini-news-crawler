                    <title>WATCH: Courtroom chaos as son bursts in, shoots dad&apos;s killer</title>
                    
                    <description>The trial concerned the murder of Francisco Alves, which occurred on October 5, 2012. Franscico Cleidivaldo Mariano de Moura confessed to the murder, which he insists occurred in self-defense.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A man attending the murder trial for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;his father’s killer&lt;/a&gt; in Brazil interrupted court proceedings to shoot the suspect half a dozen times and assault him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video of the attack was captured on CCTV from the courtroom in São José do Belmonte. The video shows the judges and jury scattering for cover as Cristiano Alves Terto, 27, opened fire at Franscico Cleidivaldo Mariano de Moura, 38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear how Terto had made it into the courtroom with a .38-caliber revolver. The attack occurred on November 29, 2023, but police only released the video on April 1, 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terto &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/trials&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;chased Moura across the courtroom&lt;/a&gt; and continued his assault by striking the defendant in the head. Police who were onsite chased him out of the room and eventually arrested him on suspicion of attempted murder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/dead-injured-police-officer-miami-dade-county-shooting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TWO DEAD, SEVEN INJURED, INCLUDING POLICE OFFICER, AFTER MIAMI-DADE COUNTY SHOOTING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moura survived the attack but had to go to a local hospital and then transfer to a larger facility for treatment. He has since been discharged, according to Jam Press. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moura killed Francisco Alves on October 5, 2012. During his confession, he claimed he had been looking for a donkey that had strayed from his property when he had found Alves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/idaho-murders-bryan-kohberger-judge-slams-defense-quizzing-locals-says-survey-concerns-him&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IDAHO MURDERS: BRYAN KOHBERGER JUDGE SLAMS DEFENSE QUIZZING LOCALS, SAYS SURVEY ‘CONCERNS’ HIM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He claimed that Alves had treated him with hostility, calling him a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/robbery-theft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;filthy little thief&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and demanding he leave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then claimed that Alves had grabbed a wooden stick and had tried to approach him, at which point Moura fired a gunshot into the air as a warning. When Alves didn’t stop, he fired another shot into the ground and eventually felt the need to defend himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/oklahoma-mom-who-executed-kids-injured-another-gunshots-head-they-slept-learns-fate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OKLAHOMA MOM WHO EXECUTED 2 KIDS, INJURED ANOTHER WITH GUNSHOTS TO THE HEAD ‘AS THEY SLEPT’ LEARNS FATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alves suffered a single gunshot wound to his abdomen, which sent him to the hospital. After 18 days under medical care and supervision, Alves died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moura fled to Salguiero, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/brazil&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a city in northern Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, remaining at large for over a decade before police found and arrested him. No retrial date has been set since he was discharged from the hospital, while Terto has remained in prison since the day after the attack.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The jury has not been reconvened, and a new date has not been assigned yet,&quot; the Pernambuco Court of Justice told British outlet Metro.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Former MLB All-Star J.J. Hardy catches heat from neighbors after starting construction on backyard field</title>
                    
                    <description>The neighbors of former MLB All-Star J.J. Hardy are apparently not too pleased with his plans to build a small field in the backyard of his Arizona home.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you build it, they might complain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Arizona woman is speaking out after she says her neighbor, former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;MLB-All Star J.J. Hardy,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; started construction on a baseball field in his backyard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pam Lang, a resident of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/arizona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chandler, Arizona,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; told KPHO a decision to build the miniature ballpark across from her property goes &quot;beyond what is reasonable to expect your neighbors to tolerate.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I didn’t sign up to live next to a baseball field,&quot; she said. &quot;It’s like a commercial – like living next to Top Golf, you know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disgruntled neighbor explained she only realized what was going on once she saw 20-foot poles go up in her backyard. She has since filed a complaint with Maricopa County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/as-announce-temporary-move-minor-league-ballpark-relocation-las-vegas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;A&apos;S ANNOUNCE TEMPORARY MOVE TO MINOR LEAGUE BALLPARK AHEAD OF RELOCATION TO LAS VEGAS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s very disappointing and frustrating that all I can do is file a complaint and hope that somebody in the county feels like listening to me,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the report, Hardy has not received the necessary permits to build the field and has until April 22 to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardy, 41, spent over a decade playing in the league with the Milwaukee Brewers and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/baltimore-orioles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Baltimore Orioles.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A three-time Gold Glove recipient and two-time All-Star, Hardy retired in 2017 with a career batting average of .256, 188 home runs and 688 RBIs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Social media users confused by USA Today claim that Biden has ‘clamped down on unauthorized border crossings’</title>
                    
                    <description>Social media users ripped into USA Today after the outlet claimed in a new report that President Biden has &amp;quot;clamped down&amp;quot; on illegal southern border crossing.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social media users this weekend were baffled by USA Today claiming that President Biden has &quot;clamped down&quot; on illegal immigration, blasting the outlet for making the claim in a recent piece about Biden’s visit to the site of the Baltimore bridge collapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlet published a report on Biden’s speech at the site of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse on Friday, where he grieved for the six immigrant workers who died after a cargo ship struck the bridge and triggered the destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to noting that Biden used the opportunity to urge &quot;Congress to take swift action to approve funding to rebuild the bridge,&quot; the piece also mentioned the president taking action on illegal immigration to America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/migrants-caught-new-video-streaming-remote-california-mountainside-illegally-cross-border&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MIGRANTS CAUGHT ON NEW VIDEO STREAMING DOWN REMOTE CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINSIDE TO ILLEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/04/05/president-biden-urges-congress-to-act-to-rebuild-baltimore-bridge/73208381007/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;It stated&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Biden, who has clamped down on unauthorized border crossings, steered clear of mentioning the victims&apos; status in the country, instead focusing on their contribution to their community.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quoting Biden, the piece added, &quot;’Most were immigrants, all were Marylanders − hardworking, strong and selfless,&quot; Biden said, during the visit 10 days after the devastating bridge collapse.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere the outlet noted where the immigrants were from, stating the deceased workers were &quot;from Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eagle-eyed critics of the president pointed out the &quot;clamped down&quot; line on social media, perplexed as to why USA Today would make the claim when Biden has overseen record numbers of border crossings during his time in office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of February, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/illegal-immigrants-biden-admin-amount-greater-population-36-states&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;nearly 7.3 million&lt;/a&gt; migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under Biden&apos;s watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/migrant-crisis-noem-national-guard-southern-borders-warzone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MIGRANT CRISIS: NOEM SENDS NATIONAL GUARD TO SOUTHERN BORDER&apos;S ‘WARZONE’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A USA Today spokesperson told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;We stand by the story.&quot; Fox News Digital also reached out to the White House for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RealClearInvestigations Senior Writer Mark Hemingway spotlighted the quote on X and commented, &quot;’Biden, who has clamped down on unauthorized border crossings…’ what the hell is going on here?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Examiner Editor-In-Chief Hugo Gordon altered the quote to be more accurate, posting, &quot;Clamped down on prevention of unauthorized border crossings.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former U.S. Armed Forces member and political commentator Robert Patrick Lewis called USA Today’s line, &quot;Propaganda, my dear boy. Pure, unadulterated election year political propaganda.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former CNBC journalist John Carney snarked, &quot;Alex, I’ll take Why People Don’t Trust the Media for $200.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Chris Pandolfo contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>NFL punters typically don&amp;apos;t garner much of the spotlight, but Mitch Wishnowsky managed to outperform his 49ers teammates during the Giants&amp;apos; home opener.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt; punter Mitch Wishnowsky was on hand for the Giants opening day festivities at Oracle Park. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special guests typically throw out the ceremonial first pitch at a Major League Baseball game, but Mishnowsky opted to do something he routinely does during &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NFL games&lt;/a&gt;, punt a football. Mishnowsky then knocked the ceremonial &quot;first punt&quot; over the ballpark&apos;s outfield wall and into McCovey Cove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A kayaker quickly retrieved the football after it splashed into the popular section of San Francisco Bay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wishnowsky&apos;s teammates, All-Pro receiver &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/49ers-deebo-samuel-delivers-hard-truth-losing-2-super-bowls-5-years&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Deebo Samuel&lt;/a&gt; and linebacker Fred Warner, also participated in the pregame ceremonies. Samuel and Warner simultaneously threw the traditional ceremonial first pitches to home plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bizarre-snowstorm-showers-pirates-home-opener-vs-orioles-pnc-park&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIZARRE SNOWSTORM SHOWERS OVER PIRATES&apos; HOME OPENER VS ORIOLES AT PNC PARK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wishnowsky was the recipient of the Ray Guy Award after his standout 2019 season at Utah.

Giants infielder Thairo Estrado hit an RBI double in the ninth inning to lift the Giants to a walk-off victory over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/san-diego-padres&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;San Diego Padres&lt;/a&gt; on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wishnowsky is averaging 45.7 yards per punt over 288 career games.

                    <title>Falcons&apos; Kirk Cousins says getting Kyle Pitts&apos; jersey number would&apos;ve cost ‘several hundred thousand’ dollars</title>
                    
                    <description></description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Kirk Cousins revealed in his introductory press conference with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/atlanta-falcons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Atlanta Falcons&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last month that tight end Kyle Pitts joked that he was willing to hand off the No. 8 jersey if it meant he would be targeted more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/minnesota-vikings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Minnesota Vikings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; quarterback would’ve happily made that exchange if it hadn&apos;t been for the NFL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a recent appearance on &quot;The Big Podcast with Shaq,&quot; Cousins said that keeping the No. 8 jersey would’ve been a costly move after the league stepped in to inform both Pitts and Cousins that they would have to both cut a check to cover the jerseys that already existed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[Pitts] wanted to switch numbers anyway, so it was like a perfect fit,&quot; Cousins said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And then the league spoke into it. They were like ‘Well, Kyle Pitts has a lot of jerseys that are No. 8 with Pitts on the back. You would have to buy every single one.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;NBA legend Shaquille O’ Neal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; quickly jumped in to say he would never pay for a number, especially after hearing what it would’ve cost Cousins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/shaquille-oneal-only-watching-womens-college-basketball-year-boys-suck&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SHAQUILLE O’NEAL SAYS HE&apos;S ONLY WATCHING WOMEN&apos;S COLLEGE BASKETBALL THIS YEAR: &apos;THE BOYS SUCK&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was a big number. And I was like ‘I don’t want to write that check. I’m good, I’m happy.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He estimated, &quot;It was several hundred thousand.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cousins will instead wear No. 18 next season when he steps on the field for Atlanta – a place he hopes will be his last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Falcons signed Cousins to a $180 million, four-year deal that includes a $50 million signing bonus and $100 million guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

I had my big giant &apos;80s hair, my blond hair down to my butt, it was permed and lots of makeup,&quot; McCarthy said. &quot;And when you go to an all-girls school, that’s not appreciated.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCarthy said a &quot;vicious&quot; group of girls would &quot;wait&quot; to torment her after school let out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jenny-mccarthy-donnie-wahlberg-renew-wedding-vows-anniversary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;JENNY MCCARTHY AND DONNIE WAHLBERG RENEW WEDDING VOWS ON 7-YEAR ANNIVERSARY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was very scary because they would wait for me after school,&quot; McCarthy said. &quot;And they did light my hair on fire at one point.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I just bottled it all up, because I was too embarrassed,&quot; she added. &quot;I thought my mom would think I’m a loser. Plus, I’m a person who doesn’t like empathy. I didn’t like people feeling sorry for me because I felt like I could handle anything … I didn’t want to be a burden anymore. My mom was always stressed about how we were going to put food on the table, so to come home and burden her more, it’s maybe a middle-child thing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, McCarthy said the experience had taught her resilience, which eventually helped her navigate the ins and outs of Hollywood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she admitted she kept her &quot;armor&quot; on as a way to protect herself. It wasn&apos;t until she met &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jenny-mccarthy-says-husband-donnie-wahlberg-still-gives-me-butterflies-with-romantic-weekly-gesture&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;husband Donnie Wahlberg &lt;/a&gt;that she was able to find peace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Once I knew Donnie was a safe space, my whole life changed,&quot; she said. &quot;Maybe that’s why I’m peaceful now, because I was able to comfort that little girl by taking off the armor and telling her, ‘You’re in a safe place now.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, McCarthy opened up about her relationship with Wahlberg as the couple prepared to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Every week [he sends me flowers],&quot; she told People. &quot;He&apos;s never missed a Monday, in 10 years. He treats me like a queen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He&apos;s my everything. He still gives me butterflies. He&apos;s the love of my life,&quot; she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Masked Singer&quot; host added that she cherishes the love that she and the &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; star share for their blended family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He loves my son Evan. He loves his kids. I love his kids. They&apos;re like my own,&quot; McCarthy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wahlberg shares two sons, Xavier, 31, and Elijah Wahlberg, 22, with his ex-wife, Kimberly Fey. McCarthy is mother to son Evan, 21, whom she shares with her ex-husband, John Asher.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Greek, Jewish, Puerto Rican: Biden has history of claiming to be &apos;honorary&apos; member of numerous ethnic groups</title>
                    
                    <description>President Biden has a history of tying himself to various ethnicity groups and cultures, saying just this week he inherited the nickname “Biden-opoulos&amp;quot; in his home state of Delaware.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt; has a long history of attempting to tie himself to a variety of ethnic groups and cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden reminded guests at the White House for a Greek Independence Day celebration this week of his claim that he inherited the nickname &quot;Biden-opoulos&quot; in his home state of Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attributing his early political success to the Greek community, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/04/04/remarks-by-president-biden-at-greek-independence-day-reception-2/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Biden said&lt;/a&gt; one of the things he &quot;learned early on was that I had a very close relationship with the Greek American community — for real, in the heart and I mean real — and the church there as well.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden said he believed &quot;every Greek American &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/delaware&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Delaware&lt;/a&gt; voted for&quot; him during his 1972 campaign for the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;By the way, as some of the Delawareans would tell you, that’s where I acquired a nickname I’m very proud of: I am Joe &apos;Biden-opoulos.&apos; That’s the nickname I got,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&apos;t the first time Biden mentioned his Greek-inspired nickname. During a 2009 White House event, then Vice President Biden said he was &quot;an honorary Greek.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-raises-90-million-march-187-million-first-quarter-2024&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN RAISES MORE THAN $90 MILLION IN MARCH, OVER $187 MILLION IN FIRST QUARTER OF 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden&apos;s remarks to Greek Americans gathered in the East Room of the White House are in line with his previous attempts to relate himself to ethnicities and communities from all across the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2022, during a reception at the White House to celebrate the Jewish New Year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-claims-he-was-raised-synagogues-adding-growing-list-exaggerated-background-claims&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Biden told&lt;/a&gt; the group Jewish Americans at the Rosh Hashanah that he &quot;went to shul&quot; more than them. Shul is the Yiddish word for synagogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You all think I&apos;m kidding. He can tell you I&apos;m not. I&apos;m not,&quot; Biden said to laughter at the time, pointing at a rabbi from Wilmington, Delaware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I&apos;m a practicing Catholic, but I&apos;d go to services on Saturday and on Sunday,&quot; he added. Biden then reaffirmed that he was not kidding about the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden has also claimed during his presidency to have been raised by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/us-puerto-rico&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Puerto Rican community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While discussing Hurricane Fiona response and recovery efforts from Puerto Rico in October 2022, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/10/03/remarks-by-president-biden-on-hurricane-fiona-response-and-recovery-efforts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden declared&lt;/a&gt; that he was &quot;sort of raised in the Puerto Rican community at home, politically.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/wapo-admits-biden-stretches-available-facts-his-background-speeches-lets-slide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WASHINGTON POST REPORTER ADMITS BIDEN ‘STRETCHES THE AVAILABLE FACTS’ ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND, BUT LETS IT SLIDE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Biden also claimed Delaware has &quot;a very, in relative terms, large Puerto Rican population in Delaware — relative to our population.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden has also attempted to make headway with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/trumps-improved-polling-black-voters-sparks-distress-liberal-pundits-hate-storyline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Black voters&lt;/a&gt; in America in recent years by claiming he came &quot;out of a Black community.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I come out of a Black community, in terms of my support,&quot; Biden said during a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/presidential-primaries&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;presidential primary debate&lt;/a&gt; in November 2019. &quot;If you notice, I have more people supporting me in the Black community that have announced for me because they know me, they know who I am.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While responding to the criticism over his remarks, Biden said a few months later, &quot;I&apos;m not saying, &apos;I am Black.&apos; But I want to tell you something — I have spent my whole career with the Black community.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some months later, in May 2020, Biden went on to claim that Black voters &quot;ain&apos;t black&quot; if they have a hard time determining whether to support him or his political rival Donald Trump. He later &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/us/politics/joe-biden-black-breakfast-club.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;walked back that comment&lt;/a&gt;, claiming he &quot;shouldn’t have been such a wise guy&quot; or &quot;so cavalier.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it doesn&apos;t stop there. Biden, who was born in Philadelphia and moved to Delaware at the age of 10, has also attempted to connect with Italian and Polish communities by touting his Irish ancestry and Catholic religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden said in 2020 that he &quot;grew up in a heavily Irish Catholic community in Scranton, Pennsylvania,&quot; as well as a &quot;heavily Italian Polish community in Claymont, Delaware.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/ireland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;connection to Ireland&lt;/a&gt; is something that he has mentioned often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We Irish are the only people who are nostalgic for the future,&quot; Biden said in 2021 ahead of a virtual meeting with Micheál Martin, who served at the time as Ireland’s taoiseach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Fairfax County police say an officer was injured while responding to a &amp;quot;street takeover&amp;quot; where hundreds gathered to watch cars do donuts in a parking lot.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fairfax County police released wild video of a &quot;street takeover&quot; that left one officer injured and a cruiser damaged last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of people gathered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/virginia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Springfield, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, at around 3 a.m. on Sunday to watch drivers do donuts and drive recklessly at a car meetup. Police Chief Kevin Davis said the purpose of the gathering was &quot;utter chaos and disorder,&quot; and that it proved dangerous for the first officer to respond to the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I believe we narrowly escaped a line-of-duty death scenario of our own. Because one of our officers was surrounded by a bunch of masked, tough-guy-wannabe-thugs who surrounded her car, and acted in a criminal manner, in a way that I’ll tell you is never going to happen again in Fairfax County,&quot; Davis told reporters at a news conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police chief said the &quot;street takeover&quot; in a parking lot in the 6600 block of Electronic Drive in Springfield endangered the lives of both the participants and bystanders. An officer on duty responded after she witnessed several vehicles pull into the lot and begin to drive recklessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/virginia-au-pair-murder-fetish-plot-affair-gun-range-tied-double-homicide-home-prosecutors-say&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIRGINIA AU PAIR MURDER: FETISH PLOT, AFFAIR, GUN RANGE TIED TO DOUBLE HOMICIDE AT HOME, PROSECUTORS SAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photos released by police showed at least one individual waving a rifle while hanging outside of a vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dashcam video released by the police department shows a large group of masked individuals surrounding the officer&apos;s cruiser. At least one person attempted to remove the license plate from her vehicle, and others blocked a second cruiser that arrived at the scene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fairfax County Police&lt;/a&gt; said some at the meetup attempted to get inside the cruiser while others banged on the windows. Davis said the officer exhibited &quot;a ton of grace under pressure in that very volatile scenario.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police chief said dozens of officers responded &quot;en masse&quot; to assist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So, what does that mean for residential and business communities? It means you didn&apos;t have any cops protecting your neighborhoods, your communities, your businesses because these criminals diverted all of our attention to handle an attack on one of our police officers,&quot; Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/va-town-dropped-police-academy-chiefs-criticism-chinese-signature-trainee-certificates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VA TOWN DROPPED BY POLICE ACADEMY FOR CHIEF&apos;S CRITICISM OF CHINESE SIGNATURE ON TRAINEE CERTIFICATES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once backup arrived, the mob of drivers and bystanders began to dissipate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four people have been charged in connection with the incident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlos A. Martinez Jr., 18, was apprehended at the scene and charged with reckless driving after he drove down the wrong side of the road and crashed into a cruiser, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fox5dc.com/news/fairfax-county-springfield-street-takeover-reckless-driver-meetup-suspects-identified-officer-injured-cruiser-damaged&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;FOX 5 DC reported&lt;/a&gt;. He was reportedly released on a summons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One driver struck an officer with their car and then fled the scene. The officer sustained minor injuries. Another police officer initiated a vehicle pursuit that ended without an arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/virginia-man-custody-following-brutal-horrifying-attacks-2-women-police&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIRGINIA MAN IN CUSTODY FOLLOWING ‘BRUTAL, HORRIFYING’ ATTACKS ON 2 WOMEN: POLICE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspected hit-and-run driver was later identified as Ronal Urrea-Hernandez, 18. Police have obtained a warrant for his arrest for felony hit-and-run, speed to elude and no operator&apos;s license. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another suspect wanted by police is 20-year-old Dylan Heckard, of Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. Police identified Heckard after he posted a selfie making a rude hand gesture on social media. His charges include assault on law enforcement and abduction for jumping on the police cruiser and preventing the officer from leaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 17-year-old, who was not identified because they are a minor, is also being charged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis said police have created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Civil Disturbance team&lt;/a&gt; to identify where these street takeovers are planned and respond to the incidents before they become dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is not going to happen again in Fairfax County,&quot; Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A campaign spokesperson for President Biden accused former President Donald Trump of inviting &amp;quot;tax cheats, scammers, racists and extremists&amp;quot; to his upcoming Palm Beach fundraiser.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; campaign has accused his Republican rival of courting unsavory groups for his upcoming fundraising dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Former President Donald Trump&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; Saturday evening fundraising dinner — held in Palm Beach, Florida, at the home of billionaire John Paulson — is being co-chaired by business mogul Robert Bigelow, former World Wrestling Entertainment executive Linda McMahon, real estate developer Steve Wynn, Red Apple Group chairman John Catsimatidis and former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-aims-shatter-bidens-fundraising-record-with-top-dollar-palm-beach-gathering&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP AIMS TO SHATTER BIDEN&apos;S FUNDRAISING RECORD WITH TOP-DOLLAR PALM BEACH GATHERING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guest list is expected to reach approximately 100 people with suggested ticket prices ranging from $250,000 to $814,600.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden campaign senior spokesperson Sarafina Chitika made an incendiary remark about the event on Friday, accusing Trump of inviting &quot;racists&quot; and &quot;extremists&quot; to dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you want to know who Donald Trump will fight for in a second term, just look at who he is having over for dinner Saturday night – tax cheats, scammers, racists and extremists,&quot; Chitika said in a statement to The Hill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-raises-90-million-march-187-million-first-quarter-2024&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN RAISES MORE THAN $90 MILLION IN MARCH, OVER $187 MILLION IN FIRST QUARTER OF 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Make no mistake, Donald Trump will do the bidding of his billionaire buddies instead of what is best for the American people,&quot; she continued. &quot;He’ll take their checks and cut their taxes, and leave hard-working Americans behind, shipping their jobs overseas, gutting Social Security and Medicare, ripping away health care protections, and banning abortion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump campaign predicts that it will haul in over $40 million at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Palm Beach&lt;/a&gt; fundraiser as they try to catch up a bit with Biden in the 2024 presidential cash dash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden re-election campaign announced Saturday that it raised more than $187 million in the first quarter of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, the campaign raked in over $90 million, up from $53 million the month before. His campaign announced it had $192 million in cash on hand, which it touted as &quot;the highest total amassed by any &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/democrats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Democratic candidate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in history at this point in the cycle.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter, 96% of donations were under $200, with more than 1.1 million donors making over 1.9 million contributions, according to the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign said it now has more than 212,000 sustaining donors — more than double the amount at this point in the 2020 cycle — who have pledged more than $5.2 million in monthly contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Kyle Morris and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Portland Trail Blazers radio host Mike Lynch took to social media to share the somber news of his ALS diagnosis and his departure from radio.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/portland-trail-blazers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Portland Trail Blazers&lt;/a&gt; fans have grown accustomed to turning on their radios and hearing Mike Lynch&apos;s voice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on Friday, the team&apos;s radio host revealed that he had been diagnosed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health/als&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (ALS) in January. Lynch also announced his retirement from radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sadly, this means the end of my radio career,&quot; Lynch wrote on X. &quot;I am thankful for all of those who listened over the last 12 years. I am also thankful to The Fan and the Blazers for believing in me and helping me grow in my dream career.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynch also expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support. He also acknowledged the difficulties he faces in his fight against the neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This has been really difficult for me, I am devastated and overwhelmed. I appreciate if you reach out, but please be patient as it is hard to respond to everyone, and I’m not always ready to talk about it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lakers-lebron-james-hints-nba-days-nearing-end-dropping-40-points-nets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LAKERS&apos; LEBRON JAMES HINTS AT NBA DAYS NEARING END AFTER DROPPING 40 POINTS ON NETS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynch graduated from Syracuse University and spent more than a decade at Portland radio station 1080 The Fan before taking a job with the city&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NBA franchise&lt;/a&gt; in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MikeLynch27/status/1776281960551473265&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW MOMENT ON X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/f/t4yrzf-help-mike-fight-als?utm_campaign=p_cp+fundraiser-sidebar&amp;amp;utm_medium=copy_link_all&amp;amp;utm_source=customer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; that Lynch&apos;s wife, Ashley, created described her husband&apos;s opportunity with the Trail Blazers as his &quot;dream job.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Since the diagnosis, Mike had to leave his career with the Blazers, and has been struggling to do the things that he really enjoyed prior to his diagnosis,&quot; the GoFundMe stated. &quot;He has been rushed through a series of doctor appointments with the ALS specialists, as well as started his treatment that is meant to slow the progress and prolong life by up to one year longer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The page also noted that Lynch was hoping to be accepted into a medical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Aid equipment has been having to be installed in the house including a soon to be stairlift, lift assist and movement assistance devices are now needing to be used regularly. We are also awaiting for our acceptance into a medical trial in hopes of finding a cure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Ahead of solar eclipse, NASA seeks public&apos;s help in recording strange animal behaviors</title>
                    
                    <description>NASA&amp;apos;s Eclipse Soundscapes Project attempts to replicate a similar study from 1935, proving the impact of solar eclipses on animal behavior. Here&amp;apos;s how the public can help.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space/nasa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NASA is asking&lt;/a&gt; for the public&apos;s help in its latest research project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2024 solar eclipse, which will occur in North America on April 8, is expected to cause several earthly disturbances, including the behavior of animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both physical and auditory &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;animal behaviors&lt;/a&gt; will shift during the eclipse, according to NASA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/solar-eclipse-2024-8-strange-things-rare-event&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLAR ECLIPSE 2024: 8 STRANGE THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN DURING THE RARE EVENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wildlife during a solar eclipse have reacted in the past as if the day suddenly turned to night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When darkness sweeps across the landscape during a total solar eclipse, unusual things start happening,&quot; NASA noted in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fooled by the false dusk, birds stop singing, crickets start chirping and bees return to their hives.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/some-schools-cancel-classes-april-8-solar-eclipse-ensure-safety&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FOR SOLAR ECLIPSE ON APRIL 8, SOME US SCHOOLS WILL BE CLOSED FOR THE DAY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As solar eclipses don’t come around often — the next event won’t occur in the U.S. for another 20 years — NASA is seeking some outside input to help with its research through its Eclipse Soundscapes (ES) Project, a NASA Citizen Science project funded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NASA Science Activation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/solar-eclipse-2024-where-how-view-rare-orbit-hitting-us&quot;

have been happening for centuries, NASA noted that &quot;the effects of an eclipse on plant and animal life are not fully understood.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The NASA-funded Eclipse Soundscapes Project will collect the sights and sounds of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/planet-earth/solar-eclipse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;total solar eclipse&lt;/a&gt; with help from interested members of the public to better understand how an eclipse affects different ecosystems,&quot; NASA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/some-schools-cancel-classes-april-8-solar-eclipse-ensure-safety&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SOLAR ECLIPSE 2024: FORMER NASA ASTRONAUT SHARES WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FROM SPACE, HOW TO SAFELY VIEW IT YOURSELF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the public can get involved by fulfilling several different roles, starting with the &quot;apprentice&quot; role, which requires online training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After apprentices earn their training certificates, they can choose to become an observer, data collector, data analyst or facilitator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All roles have accompanying training courses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data collectors will use a device called AudioMoth that collects and records soundscape data on or near the eclipse path — while observers will use any senses available to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hope is for these types of modern tools to replicate and expand upon previous studies to &quot;better understand &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/natural-science&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;animal and insect behavior,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; NASA stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This will be achieved through multisensory observations, such as audio recordings and written accounts of what is seen, heard or felt during the eclipse,&quot; the organization said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The project, which is particularly interested in learning about cricket behavior, aims to answer questions like, ‘Do nocturnal and diurnal animals act differently or become more or less vocal during a solar eclipse?’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelsey Perrett, the Massachusetts-based communications coordinator with the Eclipse Soundscapes Project, wrote in a statement that the more audio data observations that are collected, the better these questions can be answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Contributions from participatory scientists will allow us to drill down into specific ecosystems and determine how the eclipse may have impacted each of them,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When it comes down to it, answering our science questions about how eclipses impact life on Earth depends entirely on the data that people volunteer to contribute.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot;

                    <title>Families of American hostages in Gaza urge Biden to act after 6 months of conflict: &apos;Don&apos;t have time&apos; to wait</title>
                    
                    <description>President Biden&amp;apos;s slow-roll approach to attaining a cease-fire in exchange for the release of all hostages has drawn significant criticism as the conflict lurches past the six-month mark.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The families of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/six-months-families-us-hostages-gaza-stuck-ambiguous-trauma&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;American hostages who remain in terrorist custody&lt;/a&gt; in the Gaza Strip insist they have no time to wait for &quot;progress&quot; toward a deal to release their loved ones, urging President Biden to get results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;By now, they are all in dire humanitarian condition,&quot; Orna Neutra, mother of hostage Omer Neutra, said during a press conference in Lower Manhattan held on Friday. &quot;A cease-fire with a partial deal, or with no deal, could be a death sentence for our son.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are tired of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israelis-fear-bidens-intolerable-cease-fire-demand-means-victory-hamas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;hearing about progress towards a deal&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; Neutra said. &quot;We don’t have time for progress.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family members gathered Friday, marking six months since their loved ones disappeared into the Gaza Strip as hostages of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Reps. Mike Lawler, R-NY, and Dan Goldman, D-NY, joined the families in their plea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/body-israeli-hostage-retrieved-overnight-idf-operation-gaza&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BODY OF ISRAELI HOSTAGE RETRIEVED OVERNIGHT DURING IDF OPERATION IN GAZA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamas and Islamic Jihad &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-hamas-violating-cease-fire-deal-detonations-gunfire-target-idf-troops&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;released around half of their hostages&lt;/a&gt; in November during a temporary cease-fire as part of a deal that collapsed after just one week had passed, with both sides accusing the other of breaking the terms of the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Israeli military official told the Fox News Jerusalem Bureau that they estimate 133 hostages remain in the Gaza Strip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six surviving hostages are American, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-sink-amendment-halt-palestinian-aid-until-hamas-hostages-released&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;State Department said in January&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. continues to work with Qatar and Egypt to negotiate a deal to release all hostages in exchange for a cease-fire, but talks stalled out in recent weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier this week insisted, &quot;Our conviction remains that we need to see an immediate cease-fire to enable the release of hostages, but also to enable a dramatic surge in humanitarian assistance, as well as, obviously, better protecting civilians.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-defense-secretary-predicts-iran-will-strike-israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY PREDICTS IRAN WILL STRIKE AT ISRAEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamas also keeps the remains of those hostages who have died, as additional bargaining chips. Families have not been able to start the traditional grieving process of sitting Shiva, because they do not have the bodies back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/world-un-signals-no-exit-civilians-caught-gaza-war-politically-toxic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;devastation in Gaza is so tremendous&lt;/a&gt;, yes. The starvation, the destruction, the illness, the death,&quot; said Gillian Kaye, stepmother of American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen. &quot;How could people of conscience not feel that something has to happen? There needs to be a cease-fire.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Hamas has pursued a phased release of remaining hostages in exchange for ending the war and releasing Palestinian prisoners. Israel walked away from the negotiating table after Hamas rejected the most recent proposal, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the terrorist group’s demands delusional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Ackman, a billionaire and Harvard alumnus who has spoken out on a number of issues related to the Israel-Hamas conflict, wrote on social media platform X, &quot;I still believe the average American has no idea Americas are being held hostage by Hamas.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/professors-claim-pointing-hamas-brutalizes-lgbtq-people-homophobic-violence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSORS CLAIM POINTING OUT HOW HAMAS BRUTALIZES LGBTQ PEOPLE IS ‘HOMOPHOBIC VIOLENCE’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The White House issues hundreds if not thousands of statements and they do so to appease constituents among other reasons,&quot; Ackman wrote. &quot;But there is a big difference between the WH issuing a statement and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-chief-boasts-us-pressure-ending-gaza-conflict-israel-has-been-defeated&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden elevating an issue&lt;/a&gt; in his own words spoken by him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The media has written countless stories on Biden’s commentary on Snicker bar shrinkage, junk fees and shrinkflation, but I cannot think of an example where the media wrote about or talked on TV about Biden elevating the American hostage issue, and I am a big consumer of media,&quot; Ackman added. &quot;That is likely because for political reasons, the administration does not want to remind the American people that hostages are still being held.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The families spoke with Fox News Digital earlier this week, describing how they &quot;live in a different galaxy, all of us families,&quot; with every day &quot;a decision to get up and pretend to be a human.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re in a constant state of trauma, terror, agony, angst, misery, it&apos;s constant. There&apos;s never one second of not feeling trauma,&quot; said Rachel Goldberg-Polin, who last heard from her son minutes before his arm was blown off by terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her son, Hersh Goldberg Polin, 23, was kidnapped from the Nova music festival taking place near the border with Gaza when Hamas and Islamic Jihad launched their attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want to pray and be optimistic and hopeful that our leaders will be leaders,&quot; she said. &quot;Being a leader means doing what’s right for the people, even if it isn&apos;t always right for the leaders. It requires a lot of courage and selflessness and tenacity and bravery, and that&apos;s what I wish for the leaders of all these different entities that are trying to lean in.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politico reported that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/ex-obama-staffer-rips-biden-privately-angry-israel-not-changing-policy-looks-weak&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden was &quot;privately enraged&quot;&lt;/a&gt; about an airstrike that killed seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen, and former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau in response to a Politico story lashed out at the president for refusing to &quot;use leverage to stop the IDF from killing and starving innocent people,&quot; saying reports about his private opposition &quot;only make him look weak.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Ruth Marks Eglash and The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>&apos;Game of Thrones&apos; star Joseph Gatt sues DA George Gascon and LA for $40 million over false pedophilia claims</title>
                    
                    <description>&amp;quot;Game of Thrones&amp;quot; star Joseph Gatt filed a $40 million lawsuit against LA District Attorney George Gascón and more after being &amp;quot;publicly branded as a serial pedophile.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Game of Thrones&quot; star Joseph Gatt is suing Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón, the City of Los Angeles, L.A. County and others for $40 million after being arrested and charged with having &quot;online sexually explicit communication with a minor across state lines.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 52-year-old actor was arrested in April 2022 and released the same day after posting a $5,000 bail. Gatt &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/game-thrones-actor-joseph-gatt-denies-lapd-allegation-sexual-communication-minor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;vehemently denied the allegations&lt;/a&gt; at the time, and the charges were dismissed in February. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Gatt filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming that a &quot;thoroughly botched criminal investigation&quot; based on &quot;the uncorroborated word of a then-16-year-old, admittedly obsessed fan of Gatt&quot; caused the &quot;intentional destruction&quot; of his career and reputation after he was &quot;publicly branded as a serial pedophile,&quot; according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/progressive-la-county-da-gascon-faces-11-primary-challengers-amid-uproar-over-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;named Gascón&lt;/a&gt;, L.A. County, L.A. County Deputy District Attorney Angela Brunson, LAPD Detective Denos Amarantos and the City of Los Angeles as defendants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/actor-joseph-gatt-arrested-sex-crimes-minors-police&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&apos;GAME OF THRONES&apos; ACTOR JOSEPH GATT ARRESTED FOR CONTACT WITH A MINOR FOR SEXUAL OFFENSE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Defendants, using threats, intimidation and coercion, and with no cause, let alone probable cause, subjected Gatt—a successful actor with numerous film and television series credits, including Game of Thrones and Banshee, among many others — to an utterly baseless arrest, unlawful detention, unlawful search and seizure of property, and malicious prosecution in which Gatt was alleged to have electronically communicated with a minor in a sexually explicit manner,&quot; the documents stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, Gatt claimed that the arrest and investigation were due to the alleged actions of a teenage fan, referred to in the documents as &quot;Jane Doe,&quot; whom he &quot;did not know and has never actually met.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documents stated that the defendants did not interview &quot;Jane Doe&quot; until almost a year after Gatt was arrested, charged with &quot;baseless crimes&quot; and labeled a serial pedophile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the documents, a friend of the fan surprised her in October 2020 with a Cameo video from Gatt in which he wished her a happy 16th birthday. &quot;Jane Doe,&quot; who lived in Washington state, contacted Gatt on Instagram to thank him for the birthday wishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teen continued to message Gatt on Instagram for the next two to three months, and he &quot;responded in a manner that was wholly appropriate and consistent with typical celebrity-fan exchanges,&quot; according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unbeknownst to Gatt, throughout this time Jane Doe was an admittedly obsessed fan who was already using a naked picture of Gatt — a still image from his appearance on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;television show ‘Banshee’ &lt;/a&gt;that Jane Doe herself had apparently sought out and downloaded from the internet — as her phone’s lock screen even before Gatt had ever had any interaction with her,&quot; the documents claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gatt also learned much later that Jane Doe had professed that she had sexual dreams involving Gatt, and had also apparently downloaded from the internet pictures of Gatt from his appearance on the television show Z Nation and photoshopped a fake tattoo of her own name onto Gatt’s right bicep,&quot; the lawsuit added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Without Gatt’s knowledge, and apparently using software readily available on the internet for the specific purpose of creating fake social media conversations to trick and impress friends, Jane Doe thereafter wholly manufactured fake conversations between herself and Gatt via the social media platform Snapchat that were sexual in nature and pure fantasy,&quot; the lawsuit continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the lawsuit, Jane Doe&apos;s older sister found the fake Snapchat messages, took photos of them with her own phone and sent them to a police department in Washington. The documents stated that investigators referred the case to the LA DA and the LAPD in December 2021 after learning Gatt didn&apos;t live in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit accused the defendants of failing to confirm that the &quot;obviously fake&quot; photos were real before Gatt was arrested and charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gatt was arrested and prosecuted based solely on unauthenticated pictures of social media conversations displayed on an unidentified phone screen that, on their face, were highly suspicious and facially untrustworthy,&quot; the documents stated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the lawsuit alleged that Deputy District Attorney Brunson &quot;sought to destroy Gatt based on nothing more than bias and personal animosity&quot; stemming from political differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the documents, Brunson and Gatt are both active members of the high-performance sports car community in L.A., and the deputy district attorney&apos;s boyfriend worked at a motorsports tuning store that the actor frequented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gatt was well known in the high-performance sports car community generally, and to DDA Brunson specifically, for his liberal political beliefs, including his vocal support for the Black Lives Matter movement and for&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/la-prosecutor-says-boss-gascon-sent-cops-intimidate-her-home-after-blowing-whistle-soft-crime-memo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; LA County District Attorney &lt;/a&gt;George Gascón,&quot; the documents said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Like the vast majority of the high-performance sports car community, DDA Brunson espouses conservative political beliefs that are the polar opposite of Gatt’s beliefs, and she was also a vocal critic of Gascón despite working for him at the LA DA.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit alleged that Brunson &quot;ignored the glaring red flags&quot; in the evidence against Gatt before having him arrested and prosecuted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last summer, Brunson left Gascón&apos;s office for a position at the Riverside County District Attorney’s office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the documents, Gatt stated that he had lost professional opportunities after the defendants issued a statement to the press in which he was branded as a serial pedophile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gatt was immediately cancelled and what had previously been a burgeoning acting career was destroyed,&quot; the complaint reads. &quot;Gatt’s agent and PR representatives dropped him immediately, he was fired from two different movies in which he had already been cast, and he was also recast in a third movie in which he had been hired to play the lead role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Moreover, at least two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;other movies&lt;/a&gt; he had already filmed almost totally cut his scenes or reshot them with different actors, and he was not invited to attend the premieres. Gatt immediately stopped receiving any further role offers or audition opportunities, and instead received numerous death threats and was stalked and chased by a Daily Mail reporter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documents stated that Gatt had hired a private forensic investigator to examine the evidence. The lawsuit alleged that the defendants refused to allow the investigator to present his findings in court and had the case dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the lawsuit, Gatt has not worked as an actor since the arrest and had to sell his high-performance car, a Ford Shelby GT 500, to cover his legal expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a direct result of Defendants’ reckless investigation and malicious prosecution, Gatt has suffered immeasurable mental anguish and emotional distress that made him physically ill, and his reputation has been utterly destroyed,&quot; the lawsuit claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the lawsuit, Gatt is seeking &quot;to recover the more than $40 million in damages that he has suffered as a result of Defendants’ violations of his constitutional rights.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for the L.A. District Attorney&apos;s Office and the LAPD did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital&apos;s request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to Fox News Digital, Dean Z. Pamphilis, a partner with Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP and Gatt&apos;s attorney wrote, &quot;The arrest and charges against Mr. Gatt—for which he was branded by the Los Angeles DA and LAPD as a serial pedophile — were based on fabricated evidence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Twenty months later, when the fabricated evidence was finally disclosed to Mr. Gatt and Mr. Gatt’s forensic expert were prepared to expose the truth in open court, the Los Angeles DA voluntarily dismissed the criminal complaint,&quot; Pamphilis continued. &quot;Mr. Gatt, however, had already lost his community, his acting career and his personal reputation. We look forward to recovering Mr. Gatt’s enormous losses in court.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gatt is represented by Pamphilis, J. Michael Wilson, Daniel A. Saunders and Sara Wolfe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actor played Thenn Warg in the fourth season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/game-of-thrones&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Game of Thrones.&quot; &lt;/a&gt;He also is known for portraying &quot;The Albino&quot; in the Cinemax action show &quot;Banshee.&quot; Other credits include roles in movies including &quot;Black Adam,&quot; &quot;Dumbo,&quot; &quot;Titanic 666&quot; and &quot;The Retaliators.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A former Army colonel who&apos;s looking to flip a House seat from blue to red in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/north-carolina&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; says her Democratic opponent, whom she accused of being a &quot;career politician,&quot; is &quot;beholden&quot; to President Biden and the Democratic policies that continue to wreak havoc on her district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laurie Buckhout is the GOP nominee running against Rep. Don Davis, D-N.C., in the race to represent North Carolina&apos;s 1st Congressional District in the House. She spoke to Fox News Digital about her candidacy in the race, which has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;ranked as a &quot;Democrat Toss Up&quot;&lt;/a&gt; by the nonpartisan elections analyst Cook Political Report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have to admit that Davis is just Biden&apos;s, you know, surrogate on the ground. He&apos;s his agent, he&apos;s his guy. He does what Biden says, he votes with Biden,&quot; Buckhout said. &quot;He&apos;s beholden to guys like Hakeem Jeffries in Congress. He&apos;s beholden to Biden.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Davis, Buckhout claimed she&apos;s &quot;not beholden to anyone except for the voters and the constituents of eastern North Carolina.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-gain-3-us-house-seats-under-map-advanced-nc-senate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOP SET TO GAIN 3 US HOUSE SEATS UNDER MAP ADVANCED IN NC SENATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckhout accused Davis, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/air-force&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.S. Air Force veteran&lt;/a&gt; who served for 14 years in the North Carolina state Senate before getting elected to the House in Nov. 2022, of being a &quot;career politician&quot; who has &quot;never had a day in his life where he&apos;s run a business.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He&apos;s never created jobs. He&apos;s been a career politician,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You look at everything he&apos;s done, he goes down to the border, and all that is, is for photo ops,&quot; she added of Davis, who previously served as the mayor of Snow Hill, North Carolina, in the early 2000s. &quot;Has he made any changes or put forth any bills to stop the invasion? No. Has he done anything to stop illegal aliens [from] bringing fentanyl into the state or to his district? No.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckhout, who&apos;s been traveling the district to speak with voters about their concerns &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ahead of the election&lt;/a&gt;, said there are a number of issues she&apos;s hoping to tackle if elected, including poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;G.K. Butterfield, who hand-picked Don Davis to replace him, used to brag that this is the poorest district in North Carolina, and it is. It&apos;s been Democrat-led for 141 years and maybe that&apos;s the reason,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckhout said that two issues are at the top of mind in her district: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/border-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;border security&lt;/a&gt; and the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think border security is probably number one. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The economy&lt;/a&gt;, of course, is horrific, but even the poorest of people will tell you that they&apos;re just terrified about the border,&quot; she said. &quot;We caught a man on the terrorist watch list about three weeks ago in the county adjacent to mine, and we still haven&apos;t heard back from Biden about why this guy is here. So, border security is huge. And then, of course, the economy, boosting the economy, creating jobs is number two. And frankly, they&apos;re tied. We have to attack those issues head-on right away.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckhout also noted that residents in the district are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;extremely concerned&quot; about crime&lt;/a&gt; and opioid use in their neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/going-going-gone-could-republicans-slim-house-majority-slip-away-before-november&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOING, GOING, GONE: COULD THE REPUBLICANS&apos; SLIM HOUSE MAJORITY SLIP AWAY BEFORE NOVEMBER?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They&apos;re concerned about the lack of accountability of these folks coming in. They don&apos;t know who they are [or] where they came from,&quot; she said. &quot;I got a call from a couple who are very concerned about illegal aliens living next to them. They had rented out a house, and [there&apos;s] drug activity, all sorts of activity all day and night. They&apos;re concerned about drug dealers coming into the area, concerned about fentanyl, concerned about their children. So I would say crime and fentanyl are big issues.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Those of us who are adults now grew up in an America that&apos;s very different from what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Joe Biden&apos;s trying to shape&lt;/a&gt;, and we have to stop the progress that he&apos;s trying to make in ruining our country. Don Davis is a part of that,&quot; Buckhout added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to running for Congress, Buckhout served for 26 years in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/army&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt; and reached the rank of Colonel before she retired in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckhout, a graduate of James Madison University who went on to earn master’s degrees in national military strategy and information management, began her career with the Army in 1984 and later commanded an 800-person battalion attack task force as part of the initial spearhead &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/iraq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;attack into Iraq in 2003&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was blessed to come from a lineup of Army combat veterans and Army Air Corps. My mother was Army Air Corps World War II, my dad was World War II, Korea and Vietnam,&quot; she said. &quot;I grew up with that sort of military ethic. My father used to say, &apos;You guys have gotta look yourself in the eye at the end of the day and know that you did the right thing.&apos; So, serving your country and the idea of duty is really important to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The sense of standing up when you feel your country is in danger, that&apos;s never really gone away,&quot; Buckhout added. &quot;That&apos;s part of what made me decide to run for office was, as a mom and a citizen, as maybe a soldier for life, I guess, I can&apos;t step away and just watch our country burn. I feel compelled to stand up and, you know, try to change it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;tenure in the military&lt;/a&gt;, Buckhout, started a strategic consulting and services group specializing in electronic warfare and cyberspace operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We worked on some wonderful programs when I came back from Iraq, stopping our soldiers from getting blown up with IEDs,&quot; she said. &quot;When I retired from the Army in 2010, after being assigned to the Pentagon after going to Iraq, I did the same thing as a business, because it still needed to be done. Soldiers were still getting maimed and killed by improvised explosive devices in Iraq and Afghanistan. And, of course, now they&apos;ve spread all over the world, and we&apos;ve even found them on our own border.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from several national endorsements Buckhout has received, she said that her &quot;most valuable&quot; endorsements have come from those who she said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;know her best in the district&lt;/a&gt;, including Chowan County Sheriff Edward Basnight, Lenoir County Sheriff Jackie Rogers, Gates County Sheriff Ray Campbell, and District Attorney Jeff Cruden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2023, the North Carolina General Assembly adopted new congressional district boundaries, adding the counties of Chowan, Franklin, Greene, Pasquotank, Perquimans, Tyrrell and the remainder of Vance to the state&apos;s First Congressional District. The newly redrawn district now excludes Wayne County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckhout, who was elected as the district&apos;s Republican nominee last month in the GOP primary election, will face off against Davis in the state&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;general election&lt;/a&gt; on November 5.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>For some, it may seem that a controversial call in the final seconds of the semifinal game between Iowa and UConn gave way to the Hawkeyes&amp;apos; victory on Friday night.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/iowa-hawkeyes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Iowa Hawkeyes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are back in the women’s final for the second year in a row, but not without a bit of controversy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iowa battled through a tough first half &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/connecticut-huskies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;against UConn&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where star shooter Caitlin Clark was limited to just six points. A late surge in the second half, coupled with pivotal three-pointers from Clark, kept Iowa in the race. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a costly turnover with just a minute remaining gave way to Nika Muhl’s 3-pointer for a 70-69 Iowa lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in dramatic fashion, Aaliyah Edwards was called for an illegal screen on Gabbit Marshall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark made her first free throw attempt, and Sydney Affolter secured the offensive rebound on the second to end it all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversial call made waves on social media, with many disagreeing with officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My point of view, it was pretty clean,&quot; Edwards said of the offensive foul after the game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/march-madness-iowa-tops-uconn-face-undefeated-south-carolina-title-game&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MARCH MADNESS: IOWA TOPS UCONN TO FACE UNDEFEATED SOUTH CAROLINA IN TITLE GAME&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An emotional Paige Bueckers, who dropped 17 points, dismissed the significance the play had on the outcome of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everybody can make a big deal of that one single play, but not one single play wins a basketball game or loses a basketball game. I feel like there was a lot of mistakes that I made that could have prevented that play from even being that big or causing the game [to be lost].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yeah, you can look at one play and say, ‘That killed us’ or ‘That hurt us,’ but we should’ve done a better job – I should’ve done a better job of making sure we didn’t leave the game up to chance like that and leave the game up to one bad call going out way and that deciding it. Yeah, maybe that was a tough call for us, but I feel like I could’ve done a better job of preventing that from even happening.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added, &quot;We can talk about officiating, but players play. Players decide the game.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UConn coach Geno Auriemma, whose reaction on court was hard to miss, seemed displeased with the call after the game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There’s probably an illegal screen call that you could make on every single possession. I just know there were three or four of them called on us, and I don’t think there were any called on them.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iowa moves on to the title, game where they will take on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/south-carolina-gamecocks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;South Carolina.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Holly Madison accuses Crystal Hefner of ripping off book: &apos;Do your research and don&apos;t copy&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>The &amp;apos;Girls Next Door&amp;apos; star explains why Crystal Hefner&amp;apos;s memoir feels &amp;apos;too similar&amp;apos; to her own</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Holly Madison has some strong feelings about Crystal Hefner&apos;s memoir, &quot;Only Say Good Things: Surviving Playboy and Finding Myself.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a recent appearance on the &quot;LadyGang&quot; podcast, the &quot;Girls Next Door&quot; star and former Playmate, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/holly-madison-on-new-memoir-i-wasnt-out-to-write-fifty-shades-of-grandpa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;released her tell-all book&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Down the Rabbit Hole: Curious Adventures and Cautionary Tales of a Former Playboy Bunny,&quot; in 2015 explained why she feels Crystal&apos;s tale is &quot;too similar&quot; to her own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Anybody who&apos;s read my book that came out eight years ago and then read her book, tell me the narrative voice doesn&apos;t sound exactly the same,&quot; said Holly, who&apos;s been open about her tumultuous relationship with the late Hugh Hefner while living in the Playboy Mansion years ago. &quot;Drives me up a wall.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/holly-madisons-playboy-murders-investigates-horrible-true-crime-cases&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOLLY MADISON&apos;S &apos;PLAYBOY MURDERS&apos; INVESTIGATES &apos;HORRIBLE&apos; TRUE-CRIME CASES: &apos;COULD REALLY HAPPEN TO ANYONE&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She weaves fairy tale references in and out just like I did and uses a lot of the same psychological catchphrases, and things like that. I&apos;m weirded out by it, especially since she had a ghostwriter,&quot; Holly added. &quot;Like, do your research and don’t copy. . . . You would have thought that it went through somebody reading it that would be like, ‘That’s a little bit too similar.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[It felt] like reading my own book,&quot; she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crystal, whose marriage to Hugh ended when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/departed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;he died in 2017 at age 91&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, released her book earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She claimed her nearly five-year union with Hugh was &quot;emotionally abusive,&quot; noting in her book that he &quot;could be charming&quot; but also &quot;cruel.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Over a little bit of time, I gained a bit of weight, and he told me that I needed to tone up,&quot; Crystal claimed. &quot;Then he started telling me what color nails I could have and couldn’t have. [I had to] wear more colorful shirts, wear ‘the flag,’ which means the Playboy logo on my body, somewhere on my shirt. I had to dye my roots, bleach my roots. If that was growing out, he would tap it and tell me to go fix it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crystal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/marriage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;also alleged that during their marriage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, she had a restrictive curfew and was required to rush back to the Playboy Mansion before dark. The book claimed that if she were late, Hefner would scream at her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Holly detailed similar scenarios in her own memoir, she said it was &quot;relieving&quot; to hear that she wasn&apos;t the only one who had a horrific experience while living in the Playboy Mansion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of it&apos;s been very relieving for me to hear,&quot; Holly said of reading Crystal&apos;s book. &quot;Even before her book came out, when she talks about feeling like she always felt like she had to walk on eggshells or always felt like she was going to have the rug pulled out from her under any moment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the recent season of Investigation Discovery&apos;s (ID) true-crime series, &quot;The Playboy Murders&quot; - which looks at high-profile tragedies associated with the iconic magazine brand - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/holly-madison-recalls-playboy-founder-hugh-hefners-insecurities-jealous-streak&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Holly talks further about her own experience.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think people are really curious about the [Playboy] world,&quot; she told Fox News Digital in January. &quot;Even though there were a lot of negative experiences attached to it, I think for better or worse, that’s what I was put here to experience – [to] come out on the other side and tell people about it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I do look back, and I wish there were little ways I could have done it differently,&quot; she admitted. &quot;But you never know. If I had stuck up for myself more, had more of a voice back then, I probably wouldn’t have lasted there. So, I don’t think there’s any winning when it comes to that. I can’t really say I have any regrets, but would I want to go back and relive it? No.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The farewell episode was taped on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/wheel-of-fortune-fans-beg-pat-sajaks-daughter-maggie-host-show-vanna-white&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&apos;WHEEL OF FORTUNE&apos; FANS BEG PAT SAJAK&apos;S DAUGHTER MAGGIE TO HOST SHOW WITH VANNA WHITE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2023, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/pat-sajak-leaving-wheel-fortunehttps://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/pat-sajak-leaving-wheel-fortune&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sajak announced he was exiting the show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, the time has come,&quot; Sajak wrote in a statement. &quot;I’ve decided that our 41st season, which begins in September, will be my last. It’s been a wonderful ride, and I’ll have more to say in the coming months. Many thanks to you all. (If nothing else, it’ll keep the clickbait sites busy!).&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/wheel-of-fortune-vanna-white-doesnt-want-think-end-game-show-pat-sajak&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;‘WHEEL OF FORTUNE’S VANNA WHITE DOESN&apos;T WANT TO THINK ABOUT&apos; THE END OF GAME SHOW WITH PAT SAJAK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1975, the game show premiered with Chuck Woolery and Susan Stafford leading the show as hosts. It was not until 1982 that Sajak and Vanna White stepped in as co-hosts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to Sajak&apos;s exit news, Vanna White posted, &quot;When we started @WheelofFortune who could have imagined we’d still be at it 41 seasons later? I couldn’t be happier to have shared the stage with you for all these years with one more to come. Cheers to you, @patsajak!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

                    <title>James Cameron pokes fun at American gun culture during Paris ‘Terminator’ screening: ‘I can just go buy them’</title>
                    
                    <description>During a recent screening of &amp;quot;The Terminator,&amp;quot; director James Cameron joked that even though he had no knowledge of guns when making the film, he could just go buy them in America.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Legendary Hollywood director James Cameron poked fun at American gun culture during a screening of his classic film &quot;Terminator&quot; in Paris this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the screening – part of an exhibition at Paris’ Cinematheque Française on Cameron’s work – the director recounted fond memories and lessons he learned while directing the sci-fi action flick, which was his second directing effort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As noted &lt;a href=&quot;https://variety.com/2024/film/global/james-cameron-guns-terminator-america-can-buy-them-1235961822/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;in Variety&lt;/a&gt;, he provided one anecdote to the sold-out crowd about not having any idea about firearms while working on the movie, which features an iconic scene of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s character buying several massive weapons at a gun store while a giddy clerk tells them they’re &quot;ideal for home defense.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/24-celebrities-media-figures-who-ran-political-office&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24 CELEBRITIES AND MEDIA FIGURES WHO RAN FOR POLITICAL OFFICE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron, who’s from Canada, joked that at the time of directing the firearms heavy film, it didn’t matter that he had no knowledge about guns, because in America he could just go out and buy some. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I knew nothing about guns,&quot; he told the crowd. &quot;And then I thought, ‘This is America, I can just go buy them!’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a fan of guns, the &quot;Terminator&quot; and &quot;Avatar&quot; filmmaker has claimed he has been trying to use less of them in his more recent film projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/james-cameron-reveals-gunplay-action-avatar-sequel-rid-ugliness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; with Esquire Middle East in 2022, Cameron accused himself of &quot;fetishizing&quot; guns during his earlier movies and regrets it. He said, &quot;I look back on some films that I’ve made, and I don’t know if I would want to make that film now. I don’t know if I would want to fetishize the gun, like I did on a couple of Terminator movies 30+ years ago.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/joaquin-phoenix-150-jewish-creatives-hollywood-defend-oscar-winners-speech-condemning-israel&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOAQUIN PHOENIX, 150 HOLLYWOOD JEWISH CREATIVES DEFEND OSCAR WINNER&apos;S SPEECH CONDEMNING ISRAEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signaling he’s a supporter of strict gun control implemented in New Zealand, where he and his wife have a farm, he told the outlet, &quot;I’m happy to be living in New Zealand where they just banned all assault rifles two weeks after that horrific mosque shooting a couple of years ago.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also mentioned that he cut a significant portion of gunplay from that year’s &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/avatar-the-way-of-water-hit-theaters-americans-ready-long-awaited-sequel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Avatar: The Way of Water&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; telling the outlet, &quot;I actually cut about 10 minutes of the movie targeting gunplay action. I wanted to get rid of some of the ugliness, to find a balance between light and dark.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron did admit to some of the challenges of cutting down on such violent depictions, being one of the world’s most famous action filmmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As noted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt;, he said, &quot;You have to have conflict, of course. Violence and action are the same thing, depending on how you look at it. This is the dilemma of every action filmmaker, and I’m known as an action filmmaker.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Texas man, 105, to witness his 13th total solar eclipse: &apos;They&apos;re so beautiful&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>A 105-year-old amateur astronomer is planning to see his 13th total solar eclipse on April 8. The Fort Worth, Texas, resident will travel to Plano for an ideal viewing experience.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A 105-year-old Texas resident is gearing up to see the total solar eclipse on April 8 — and it&apos;s not his first rodeo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LaVerne Biser of Fort Worth said his interest in astronomy began in high school, back in the 1930s. The umbraphile, a term referring to people who chase eclipses, spent his childhood admiring stars from his parent&apos;s Troy, Ohio, farmland in the 1920s, he told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fox4news.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;FOX 4 Dallas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Growing up, we were familiar with Orion’s shield, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Big Dipper&lt;/a&gt; … all the G5 constellations,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/skydivers-enjoy-april-8-solar-eclipse-taking-plunge-totality-event&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SKYDIVERS TO ENJOY THE APRIL 8 SOLAR ECLIPSE BY TAKING THE PLUNGE DURING TOTALITY: &apos;SPECIAL EVENT&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He still recalls seeing the Milky Way for the first time as a child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it wasn&apos;t until 1963 that he saw his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/planet-earth/solar-eclipse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;first total solar eclipse&lt;/a&gt; — and he was hooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You see one, you want to see them all and will do everything you can to see them,&quot; Biser said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They&apos;re so beautiful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/solar-eclipse-2024-where-how-view-rare-orbit-hitting-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLAR ECLIPSE 2024: WHERE AND HOW TO VIEW THE RARE ORBIT HITTING THE US&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biser, an engineer by trade, earned his bachelor&apos;s degree from Ohio State University in 1942. He later completed his master&apos;s degree from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, before moving on to work for General Dynamics, a global aerospace and defense company headquartered in Reston, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biser and his wife, Marion, who died at age 97 in 2023, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/travel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;enjoyed traveling&lt;/a&gt; and watching eclipses as a couple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the couple wasn&apos;t visiting the U.S. Virgin Islands or the Black Sea, they would drive across the country to find the ideal spot to see a total solar eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The centenarian is still able to recite the years when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/how-photograph-total-solar-eclipse-tips-amateur-photographers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;witnessed a solar eclipse.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/solar-eclipse-2024-8-strange-things-rare-event&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLAR ECLIPSE 2024: 8 STRANGE THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN DURING THE RARE EVENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;1963, 1972, ‘79, ’84, ‘88, ’91, ‘94, ’98, &apos;99, 2012, 2017, 2023,&quot; Biser said to FOX 4. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eclipse of 2017 was the last eclipse that he witnessed together with his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was a good one,&quot; he recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biser carefully planned his next eclipse viewing. He has determined that he&apos;ll travel from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fort Worth&lt;/a&gt; to Plano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Over here, I’m at the edge of the pattern and it doesn’t last very long,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Over there is closer to the middle. It’ll last three or four minutes over there. That’s where we’re going to go. My daughter is there in Plano.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/solar-eclipse-eye-safety-can-staring-cause-blindness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLAR ECLIPSE EYE SAFETY: CAN STARING AT THE SUN CAUSE BLINDNESS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amateur astronomer cautions everyone to wear their safety glasses while gazing at a partial eclipse, but says they can remove them once a total solar eclipse is reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when asked about his health, Biser credited his longevity and energy to his teetotalism, plus never smoking cigarettes or taking illicit drugs, according to FOX 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just good Christian living,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Body of Israeli hostage retrieved overnight during IDF operation in Gaza</title>
                    
                    <description>Elad Katzir and his mother were taken on Oct. 7 from Kibbutz Nir Oz, but his mother was released as part of the late November 2023 temporary cease-fire agreement.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The body of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israeli-intelligence-confirms-dozens-hostages-thought-alive-gaza-dead-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;another Israeli hostage&lt;/a&gt; has been recovered from the Gaza Strip and returned to Israel overnight Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The operation to retrieve the body started at 20:00 p.m. (last night) and lasted several hours, where his body was excavated from underground in a compound located in the southern part of Khan Yunes,&quot; a military official told the Fox News Jerusalem Bureau. &quot;His body was then brought to Israel for further identification.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The whole effort was conducted and bolstered by comprehensive ground and air activity,&quot; the official said, adding that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;terrorist groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad&lt;/a&gt; still have 133 hostages hidden away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-dismisses-2-officers-deadly-drone-strikes-aid-workers-gaza&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISRAEL DISMISSES 2 OFFICERS OVER DEADLY DRONE STRIKES ON AID WORKERS IN GAZA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official identified the body as that of 47-year-old Elad Katzir. His mother, Hanna, was also a hostage but was released on Nov. 24, 2023, as part of the temporary cease-fire at that time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A joint statement from the Israel Security Agency (ISA) and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/idf-strike-killed-world-central-kitchen-workers-serious-failure-mistaken-identification&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Katzir was &quot;murdered in captivity,&quot; likely in January this year. Katzir’s sister in a post on Facebook claimed Hamas had murdered her brother, while the ISA and IDF indicated that Islamic Jihad likely bore responsibility.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-defense-secretary-predicts-iran-will-strike-israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY PREDICTS IRAN WILL STRIKE AT ISRAEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Following an identification procedure carried out overnight by medical officials at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, IDF and ISA representatives informed Elad Katzir&apos;s family that his body had been rescued,&quot; the statement read. &quot;The IDF and ISA express their deepest condolences to the family.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katzir and his mother were among those abducted on Oct. 7 from Kibbutz Nir Oz. The ISA and IDF stressed that they are working &quot;in full coordination with the relevant national and security bodies and will continue until the task is complete&quot; to retrieve all hostages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katzir was a farmer and social activist who volunteered for the &quot;Hadar Foundation,&quot; fighting for the release of two Israeli soldiers whose bodies are held in Gaza. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Yael Rotem-Kuriel and Yonat Friling contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Biden-appointed judge torches DOJ for defying subpoenas after prosecuting Trump advisor</title>
                    
                    <description>A Joe Biden judge blasted the president&amp;apos;s Justice Department Friday for hypocritically allowing its attorneys to defy a subpoena event though it prosecuted a Trump advisor for doing the same thing.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt;-appointed judge slammed the Justice Department’s apparent hypocrisy on Friday for allowing attorneys involved in the Biden family investigation to defy subpoenas — even though former Trump advisor Peter Navarro is sitting in prison for doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;District Judge Ana Reyes ripped the DOJ at a status conference for not letting DOJ lawyers Mark Daly and Jack Morgan provide testimony as part of the House Judiciary Committee&apos;s investigation into the Biden family and the impeachment inquiry into the president. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There’s a person in jail right now because you all brought a criminal lawsuit against him because he did not appear for a House subpoena,&quot; Reyes said during a hearing on the Judiciary Committee’s lawsuit, according to Politico, seemingly referring to Navarro. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-claimed-didnt-stand-to-gain-anything-controversial-burisma-role-despite-making-millions&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HUNTER BIDEN CLAIMED HE DIDN&apos;T &apos;STAND TO GAIN ANYTHING&apos; IN CONTROVERSIAL BURISMA ROLE DESPITE MAKING MILLIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navarro was sent to prison in March for four months, charged and convicted with contempt of Congress after he refused to comply with a congressional subpoena demanding his testimony and documents relating to the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Navarro said he could not cooperate with the committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;because Trump&lt;/a&gt; had invoked executive privilege, an argument that lower courts have rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; adviser Steve Bannon also received a four-month sentence for similar contempt of Congress charges but was allowed to stay free pending appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think it’s quite rich you guys pursue criminal investigations and put people in jail for not showing up,&quot; but then direct current executive branch employees to take the same approach, Reyes blasted. &quot;You all are making a bunch of arguments that you would never accept from any other litigant.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And now you guys are flouting those subpoenas. . . . And you don’t have to show up?&quot; Reyes continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that the DOJ’s position would delight defense attorneys up and down the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I imagine that there are hundreds, if not thousands of defense attorneys . . . who would be happy to hear that DOJ’s position is, if you don’t agree with a subpoena, if you believe it’s unconstitutional or unlawful, you can unilaterally not show up,&quot; Reyes said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-attorney-slams-abnormal-way-special-counsel-weiss-handled-case-judge-denies-dismissal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HUNTER BIDEN ATTORNEY SLAMS &apos;ABNORMAL WAY&apos; SPECIAL COUNSEL WEISS HANDLED CASE AFTER JUDGE DENIES DISMISSAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daly and Morgan, two attorneys with the Justice Department’s tax division, were subpoenaed for their &quot;firsthand knowledge of the irregularities in DOJ’s investigation that appear to have benefited Hunter Biden,&quot; according to Courthouse News Service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee says the pair were members of a team that recommended what charges to bring against Hunter Biden for suspected tax crimes in 2014 and 2015 when he served on the board of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ukrainian company&lt;/a&gt; Burisma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That team initially agreed Hunter Biden should be charged but then reversed course and suggested he should not be charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the reversal, the Justice Department allowed the statute of limitations for those charges to lapse. The committee argues looking into this timeline is crucial to its investigation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Department attorney James Gilligan tried to argue that the decision to defy the subpoena came after lengthy deliberations &quot;at a high level.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also argued that Daly and Morgan are current government employees, whereas Navarro and Bannon were no longer part of the government when their testimony was demanded, but Reyes seemed unimpressed by that reasoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But her criticism wasn’t all directed at Biden’s DOJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reyes scoffed at a Trump-era Office of Legal Counsel opinion contending that executive branch employees could defy such subpoenas if Justice Department lawyers were not allowed to be present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was also astonished that Gilligan wouldn&apos;t commit to instructing Daly and Morgan to testify if the committee were to drop its insistence that government counsel not be in the room for their depositions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I cannot answer that now,&quot; he said. To which Reyes responded, &quot;Are you kidding me?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Anders Hagstrom contributed to this report.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>March Madness: Iowa tops UConn to face undefeated South Carolina in title game</title>
                    
                    <description>The Iowa Hawkeyes and South Carolina Gamecocks are headed to the big stage where both teams will face off in Cleveland on Sunday for the women&amp;apos;s college basketball national championship.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/iowa-hawkeyes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Iowa Hawkeyes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are headed back to center stage after defeating a gritty and resilient  UConn team in the women’s semifinal on Friday night. But waiting for them will be their fiercest competitor yet – the undefeated South Carolina Gamecocks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iowa and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/south-carolina-gamecocks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;South Carolina&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will face off in Cleveland on Sunday afternoon after two very different journeys this season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caitlin Clark has left an indelible mark on college basketball on her way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/wnba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the WNBA.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In her final season at Iowa, Clark became the all-time leading women&apos;s scorer and, eventually, the NCAA Division I overall career scoring leader. All she has left to achieve is becoming a national champion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with all eyes on Iowa and the record books, South Carolina has flown under the radar, and Dawn Staley’s Gamecocks are undoubtedly out for revenge following last season’s heartbreaking loss to the Hawkeyes in the women’s semifinals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Carolina finished their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/south-carolina-dominates-nc-state-reach-womens-basketball-national-title-game&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;semifinal matchup against North Carolina State&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the same way they entered it – undefeated. All-America center Kamilla Cardoso dropped a team-high of 22 points with 11 rebounds to help South Carolina steamroll past the Wolfpack with a 78-59 victory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After closing out the first half with a one point lead, the Gamecocks turned it up, outscoring NC State 29-6. Raven Johnson added 13 points, two rebounds and five assists for the Gamecocks while Te-Hina Paopao had 10 points and six assists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Gamecocks easily secured their place in the final, Iowa &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/connecticut-huskies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;battled UConn&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a semifinal that was really anyone’s game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/final-four-power-rankings-march-madness-ncaa-tournament&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FINAL FOUR POWER RANKINGS: HOW EACH TEAM STACKS UP HEADING INTO NCAA TOURNAMENT SEMIFINALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Huskies successfully shutdown Clark in the first half, but the prolific shooter still managed to score 21 points including three momentum-turning 3-pointers in the second half to lead the Hawkeyes&apos; late push to victory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iowa held a four point lead with just under a minute remaining but Nika Muhl hit a 3-pointer with 39 seconds left to keep the Huskies alive. A controversial offensive foul called on Aaliyah Edwards with three seconds remaining sealed UConn’s fate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iowa moved on after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/iowa-survives-uconns-late-game-push-reach-ncaa-title-game&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;a 71-69 victory.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Carolina are looking to become the first team to win a national championship undefeated since UConn did so in 2016. But this isn’t their first go at. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gamecocks reached the semifinal last year with a perfect record, but it was Iowa that ended their run there. Clark dropped 41 points in the 77-73 victory to advance to the final, where they would eventually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/lsu-tigers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;lose to LSU.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite the circumstances being the same, no one is counting South Carolina out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;South Carolina has been the top of the top. They’re in a different league. We’re going to do everything we can to try to be right there with them,&quot; Clark said Friday night. &quot;But, yeah, I think the biggest thing is enjoy this tonight, and we’ll go over the scout early in the morning.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chasing history as well, Iowa is looking to earn the program’s first title – a feat that has eluded Clark up until this point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women’s national championship game will tip off in Cleveland on Sunday at 3 p.m. ET. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese officials are furious after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;People&apos;s Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; attempted to claim worldwide sympathies following a devastating earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China, which makes disputed claims of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/taiwan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ownership over Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, thanked the global community for expressions of grief after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake rocked the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We thank the international community for its expressions of sympathy and concern,&quot; Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the U.N. Geng Shuang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/taiwan-earthquake-survivors-recall-destruction-rescue-sealed-tunnels&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAIWAN EARTHQUAKE SURVIVORS RECALL DESTRUCTION, RESCUE FROM SEALED TUNNELS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized the statement as a &quot;shameless use of the Taiwan earthquake&quot; to push its international &quot;cognitive operations,&quot; according to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement by China — which implied sovereignty and ownership of the island — follows weeks of escalating tension in East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-sends-warplanes-boats-taiwan-phone-call-xi-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chinese warplanes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and multiple naval ships were reported around Taiwan this week, the largest coordinated display since last year. At least 30 planes and nine ships were detected in Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) by the country&apos;s Ministry of National Defense (MND).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/taiwan-earthquake-rescue-operations-ongoing-as-death-toll-reaches-10&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAIWAN EARTHQUAKE: RESCUE OPERATIONS ONGOING AS DEATH TOLL REACHES 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incursion into Taiwanese territory by People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA) planes and sea vessels followed a Tuesday phone call between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/xi-jinping&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chinese President Xi Jinping&lt;/a&gt; and U.S. President Joe Biden. It was the first time the two have spoken since July 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;China’s ongoing military expansion and gray-zone provocations have been posing formidable challenges to the region. MOFA welcomes the international community’s continued focus on peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,&quot; the Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement Wednesday. &quot;As a responsible member of the global village, Taiwan will do its utmost to enhance its self-defense capabilities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement added, &quot;It will also steadily deepen its comprehensive partnership and strengthen close cooperation with the United States. Taiwan will continue to work with like-minded partners to safeguard the rules-based international order and ensure peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific region.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
