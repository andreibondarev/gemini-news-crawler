                    <title>3 Native American tribes seeking rights to Colorado River water in $5B settlement</title>
                    
                    <description>A proposed water rights settlement would be the first step in securing Colorado River water for the Navajo, Hopi and San Juan Southern Paiute tribes.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A proposed water rights settlement for three Native American tribes that carries a price tag larger than any such agreement enacted by Congress took a significant step forward late Monday with introduction in the Navajo Nation Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Navajo Nation has one of the largest single outstanding claims in the Colorado River basin and will vote soon on the measure in a special session. It&apos;s the first of many approvals — ending with Congress — that&apos;s needed to finalize the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climate change, the coronavirus pandemic and demands on the river like those that have allowed Phoenix, Las Vegas and other desert cities to thrive pushed the tribes into settlement talks. The Navajo, Hopi and San Juan Southern Paiute tribes are hoping to close the deal quickly under a Democratic administration in Arizona and with Joe Biden as president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/plumbing-problem-glen-canyon-dam-threatens-water-supply-colorado-river-system&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLUMBING PROBLEM AT GLEN CANYON DAM THREATENS WATER SUPPLY OF COLORADO RIVER SYSTEM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A landmark 1922 agreement divided the Colorado River basin water among seven western states but left out tribes. The tribes are seeking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/water&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;water from a mix of sources&lt;/a&gt;: the Colorado River, the Little Colorado River, aquifers and washes on tribal lands in northeastern Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly one-third of homes on the Navajo Nation, which stretches across 27,000 square miles of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, don&apos;t have running water. Many homes on Hopi are similarly situated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Juan Southern Paiute will vote on the settlement within weeks, tribal President Robbin Preston Jr. said in an email. Along with guaranteed water deliveries, the tribe is asking Congress to approve a treaty it signed with the Navajo Nation in 2000 to establish an 8.4 square-mile reservation within the Navajo reservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will have economic opportunities that our tribal members have never seen before, and which will give hope and pride to our people,&quot; Preston said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a settlement, the tribes would be at the mercy of courts. Already, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the federal government is not bound by treaties with the Navajo Nation to secure water for the tribe. Navajo has the largest land base of any of the 574 federally recognized tribes and is second in population with more than 400,000 citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate case that has played out over decades in Arizona over the Little Colorado River basin likely will result in far less water than the Navajo Nation says it needs because the tribe has to prove it has historically used the water. That’s hard to do when the tribe hasn’t had access to much of it, Navajo Attorney General Ethel Branch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress has enacted nearly three dozen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mining-company-cant-tap-water-needed-for-okefenokee-wildlife-refuge-us-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;tribal water rights settlements&lt;/a&gt; across the U.S. since 1978. Federal negotiation teams are working on another 22 settlements involving 34 tribes in nine states, the Interior Department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The costliest one enacted by Congress was for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in Montana at $1.9 billion. The Navajo, Hopi and San Juan Southern Paiute tribes are seeking more than $5 billion in their settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $1.75 billion of that would fund a pipeline from Lake Powell, one of the two largest reservoirs in the Colorado River system, on the Arizona-Utah border. The settlement would require the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to complete it by the end of 2040.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, water would be delivered to dozens of tribal communities in remote areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whatever funding we walk away with is funding we don&apos;t otherwise have,&quot; Branch said. &quot;It will be a challenge.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Navajo Nation has settled its claims to the Colorado River basin in New Mexico and Utah. It&apos;s separately pursuing two other much smaller settlements in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona — situated in the Colorado River’s Lower Basin with California, Nevada and Mexico — is unique in that it also has an allocation in the Upper Basin. Under the settlement terms, Navajo and Hopi would get about 47,000 acre-feet in the Upper Basin — nearly the entire amount that was set aside for use at the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant that shut down in late 2019. Navajo previously had agreed not to seek that water for the 50 years prior to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal also includes a combined 9,500 acre-feet per year of water from the Colorado River&apos;s Lower Basin for Navajo and Hopi. Navajo additionally would have the right to draw 40,780 acre-feet from the Little Colorado River — about one-third of what&apos;s estimated to reach the reservation annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An acre-foot of water is roughly enough to serve two to three U.S. households annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona, in turn, gets certainty in the amount of water available throughout the state as it&apos;s forced to cut back as the overall supply diminishes. Navajo and Hopi, like other Arizona tribes, could be part of that solution if they secure the right to lease water within the state that could be delivered through a canal system that already serves metropolitan Tucson and Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two tribes came close to reaching a pact to settle water rights &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/arizona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Arizona&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, but the tentative deal fell through. This time around, Navajo officials launched a public education campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They held lengthy community meetings with translations in Navajo — &quot;tó bee há haz&apos; a&quot; meaning &quot;water right,&quot; for example — and described water&apos;s role in the tribe&apos;s creation story and in ceremonies. They explained complicated water law, past attempts to settle and what&apos;s at stake if the settlement fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Leupp, the audience mostly asked about immediate needs: fixing the electricity on the water pump, improving roads and drilling wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marlene Yazzie recalled her mother hitchhiking more than 100 miles to pressure tribal officials for electricity and water — which never came. Yazzie herself relies on water hauled to her home in nearby Birdsprings for washing, drinking and for her livestock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How many more years do we have to wait?&quot; she asked.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Putin to visit China this week to meet with Xi, Chinese Foreign Ministry says</title>
                    
                    <description>Russian President Vladimir Putin is set to visit China for two days, strengthening the alliance between the two authoritarian powers against the Western order led by the U.S.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; will make a two-day state visit to China this week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Tuesday, in the latest show of unity between the two authoritarian allies against the U.S.-led Western liberal global order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin will meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping during his visit starting on Thurday, the ministry said, saying the two leaders would discuss &quot;cooperation in various fields of bilateral relations ... as well as international and regional issues of common concern.&quot; No details were mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin in a statement confirmed the trip and said Putin was going on Xi’s invitation. It said that this will be Putin’s first foreign trip since he was sworn in as president and began his fifth term in office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/putin-secures-5th-term-russian-president-election-no-real-opposition-addresses-navalny-death&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PUTIN SECURES 5TH TERM AS RUSSIAN PRESIDENT IN ELECTION WITH NO REAL OPPOSITION, ADDRESSES NAVALNY DEATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;China has&lt;/a&gt; backed Russia politically in the conflict in Ukraine and has continued to export machine tools, electronics and other items seen as contributing to the Russian war effort, without actually exporting weaponry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is also a major export market for energy supplies that keep the Kremlin’s coffers full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has sought to project itself as a neutral party in the conflict, but has declared a &quot;no limits&quot; relationship &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;with Russia&lt;/a&gt; in opposition to the West. The sides have also held a series of joint military drills and China has consistently opposed economic sanctions against Russia in response to its now two-year-old campaign of conquest against Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two continent-sized authoritarian states are increasingly in dispute with democracies and NATO while seeking to gain influence in Africa, the Middle East and South America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin&apos;s visit comes just days ahead of Monday&apos;s inauguration of William Lai Ching-te as the next president of Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that China claims as its own territory and threatens to annex by force if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xi returned last week from a five-day visit to Europe, including stops in Hungary and Serbia, countries viewed as close to Russia. The trip, Xi&apos;s first to the continent in five years, was seen as an attempt to increase China&apos;s influence and drive a wedge between the EU and NATO on one side, and a yet-to-be-defined bloc of authoritarian nations on the other underpinned by Chinese economic influence that has been wavering amid a housing crisis and dramatically slower domestic economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Austrian judges have ruled that Josef Fritzl, who imprisoned and raped his daughter for 24 years, can be moved from psychiatric detention to a regular prison.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Austrian judges&lt;/a&gt; have ruled that a man who kept his daughter captive for 24 years, raped her thousands of times and fathered seven children with her, can be moved from psychiatric detention to a regular prison, a court said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision on Monday was the latest in a legal back-and-forth on Josef Fritzl&apos;s future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state court in the town of Krems said in a statement that the 89-year-old can be moved as he no longer poses the kind of danger that requires keeping him in psychiatric detention. The decision was based on an April 30 hearing with Fritzl, as well as reports by forensic and psychiatric experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/josef-fritzl-transfer-regular-prison&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOSEF FRITZL, WHO RAPED DAUGHTER AND KEPT HER CAPTIVE FOR 24 YEARS, COULD MOVE TO REGULAR PRISON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of Fritzl&apos;s advancing dementia and physical decline, psychiatric detention is no longer necessary for his &quot;combined personality disorder&quot; as there is no longer a danger of Fritzl committing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;serious crimes&lt;/a&gt;, the court said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court said Fritzl can be moved to the prison for a 10-year trial period but that he cannot be released from detention altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors appealed an earlier decision in January that Fritzl could be moved to a regular prison, and both sides also are entitled to appeal the latest decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His crime came to light in 2008 and he was sentenced in 2009 to life imprisonment for committing incest, rape, coercion, false imprisonment and enslavement of his daughter, and negligent homicide of one of his infant sons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fritzl became known as the &quot;Monster of Amstetten&quot; after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;northern Austrian&lt;/a&gt; town where he locked up his then-18-year-old daughter in a sound-proofed basement of his house in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next 24 years, he repeatedly raped her and fathered seven children with her, one of whom died.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Bill Maher says Louis C.K. should be allowed to return to mainstream after #MeToo scandal</title>
                    
                    <description>Comedian Bill Maher called on stand-up comic Louis C.K. to be allowed to return to the mainstream after he was canceled in 2017 for sexual misconduct scandals.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bill Maher called on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/comedy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;stand-up comic&lt;/a&gt; Louis C.K. to be allowed to return to mainstream entertainment after his sexual misconduct scandal during the height of the #MeToo movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Isn’t it time everyone just went: ‘OK, It wasn’t a cool thing to do, but it’s been long enough and welcome back.’ Enough!&quot; Maher said on a new episode of his podcast, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1V2nsKUeX8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Club Random&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I mean for Christ’s sake, it’s not the end of the world,&quot; Maher told comedian Bill Burr in a conversation on cancel culture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-i-speak-vast-middle-normies-tired-tribal-politics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BILL MAHER: I SPEAK FOR THE &apos;VAST MIDDLE&apos; AND &apos;NORMIES&apos; TIRED OF TRIBAL POLITICS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People have done so much worse things and gotten less,&quot; Maher told Burr. &quot;There’s no rhyme or reason to the #MeToo-type punishments.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louis C.K. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/louis-c-k-addresses-sexual-misconduct-accusations-its-true&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;admitted to sexual misconduct allegations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 after five women claimed that he masturbated in front of them without their consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his fall from grace at the time and Maher&apos;s complaints, C.K. returned to the spotlight to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/louis-ck-grammy-win-backlash&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;win a Grammy award&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 for his &quot;Sincerely Louis C.K.&quot; album, and has since returned to the stand-up circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-unleashes-stormy-daniels-testimony-trump-trial-shes-bad-witness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BILL MAHER UNLEASHES ON STORMY DANIELS’ TESTIMONY IN TRUMP TRIAL: &apos;SHE&apos;S A BAD WITNESS!&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They took $50 million, I think they punished him,&quot; Burr said of C.K. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burr also argued that cancel culture was no longer a relevant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;cultural force&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It started off with something everyone could agree on, and then quickly it just spun out of [control],&quot; Burr said of the beginnings of cancel culture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I remember whenever cancel culture got to the point of where it was, ‘I don’t like some of the topics in your stand-up act,’ right? That’s when it got weird,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Burr declared that cancel culture was &quot;over&quot; and that &quot;no one cares anymore.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&apos;s so not true,&quot; Maher said. &quot;Either one of us could get canceled in the next two minutes.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maher has spoken out against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/cancel-culture&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;cancel culture&lt;/a&gt; multiple times in his career. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Maher said that he has lost many &quot;super woke&quot; fans who disagree with his political views. While a progressive, Maher often mocks what he views as the excesses of the left. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don&apos;t let the door hit you in the a--,&quot; the comedian said. &quot;You were no fun to begin with. You have a terrible sense of humor.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Tracy Wright and Larry Fink contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>The mother of U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Gordon Black, who is being detained in Vladivostok, Russia, reveals to Fox News Digital what she would say to him now.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mother of a U.S. Army soldier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/russian-court-says-detained-us-army-soldier-held-july-allegedly-causing-significant-damage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;who has been detained in Russia&lt;/a&gt; after visiting a girlfriend tells Fox News Digital that if she could write a letter to her son, she would say &quot;I love you, I miss you, [and] I hope you get to come home soon.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melody Jones is speaking out as it is approaching two weeks since Staff Sgt. Gordon Black was taken into custody by Russian authorities in the far eastern city of Vladivostok. Black, 34, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/wife-army-soldier-detained-russia-previously-retained-divorce-lawyer-aware-his-travels-attorney&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;has been charged with criminal misconduct&lt;/a&gt; and is accused of stealing from his girlfriend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think he worries about shaming us, and I would tell him in a letter, no you haven’t,&quot; Jones told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that this past Mother’s Day without him was &quot;really hard&quot; and that she isn’t aware of his current condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/mother-soldier-detained-russia-girlfriend-begged-money-arrest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOTHER OF DETAINED US SOLDIER SAYS RUSSIAN GIRLFRIEND BEGGED FOR MONEY BEFORE HIS ARREST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We don’t hear anything, it’s bugging me,&quot; Jones said. &quot;What I understand, they have not been able to see him.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It would be nice to know that he is OK. You worry about those things, being a momma,&quot; she also said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Army spokesperson, when asked by Fox News Digital this week for further information on Black’s situation, said &quot;there are no new updates at this time.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department did not respond to a request for comment, but a spokesperson said last week that it is aware of Black’s reported arrest and detention and that the department has no higher priority than the safety and security of Americans abroad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black enlisted in the Army as an infantryman in 2008 and has been assigned to the Eighth Army U.S. Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea. He traveled to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Vladivostok, Russia,&lt;/a&gt; &quot;for personal reasons&quot; prior to his arrest on May 2, the Pentagon says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/mother-american-soldier-detained-russia-while-visiting-girlfriend-believes-set-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOTHER OF AMERICAN SOLDIER DETAINED IN RUSSIA WHILE VISITING GIRLFRIEND BELIEVES HE WAS ‘SET UP’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pervomaisky District Court of Vladivostok said &quot;When choosing the preventive measure in the form of detention, the court came to the conclusion that US citizen B. (Black) -- under the weight of the charges -- could hide from the preliminary investigation authorities and the court to avoid responsibility,&quot; according to Reuters.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reportedly added that Black will be detained until July 2 for &quot;secretly stealing the property of citizen T., causing the latter significant damage.&quot; Russian officials in Vladivostok said a 32-year-old woman had filed a complaint against Black. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters cited the officials as saying that the pair met in South Korea before Black came to visit her in Russia, during which they became involved in an argument. She then reportedly filed a police report accusing him of stealing money and Black was taken into custody at a hotel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On April 10, Black out-processed from Eighth Army and signed out on permanent change of station, to leave en route to Texas,&quot; Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said last Tuesday. &quot;However, instead of returning to the U.S., Black flew from Korea through China, and then to Vladivostok, Russia, for personal reasons.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Army has opened an administrative investigation to determine the facts and circumstances around his travel, Singh noted, and part of the investigation will involve looking into consequences for his actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones previously told Fox News that her son&apos;s Russian girlfriend asked her for money shortly before her son was arrested on theft charges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Bailee Hill, Louis Casiano, Greg Wehner and Pilar Arias contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Rescuers are searching for bodies, and whenever possible survivors, of flash floods that hit Indonesia’s Sumatra Island over the weekend, authorities say.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rescuers on Tuesday searched in rivers and the rubble of devastated villages for bodies, and whenever possible survivors, of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/flash-flood&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;flash floods&lt;/a&gt; that hit Indonesia’s Sumatra Island over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monsoon rains and a landslide of mud and cold lava from Mount Marapi caused rivers to breach their banks. The deluge tore through mountainside villages in four districts in West Sumatra province just before midnight Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The floods swept away people and 79 homes and submerged hundreds of houses and buildings, forcing more than 3,300 residents to flee to temporary government shelters, National Disaster Management Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/indonesias-mount-ibu-volcano-erupts-authorities-prepare-evacuate-thousands&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INDONESIA&apos;S MOUNT IBU VOLCANO ERUPTS, AUTHORITIES PREPARE TO EVACUATE THOUSANDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Search and Rescue Agency said in a statement that 52 bodies had been pulled from mud and rivers by Tuesday, mostly in the worst-hit Agam and Tanah Datar districts, while rescuers are searching for 20 people who are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/missing-persons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;reportedly missing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency said that more downpours were forecast for the West Sumatra province in the coming days, and that the danger of extreme rainfall would continue until next week. The agency recommended the application of weather modification to reduce rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Disaster Management Agency chief Suharyanto said that authorities would start seeding clouds in the province in a bid to prevent further rainfall and flash floods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are deploying weather modification technology starting tomorrow so that rain does not fall during this emergency response period,&quot; Suharyanto, who goes by a single name like many Indonesians, told reporters while visiting devastated areas in Agam district. He added that the emergency response will be ended on May 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Television reports showed rescue personnel using jackhammers, circular saws, farm tools and sometimes their bare hands, digging desperately in Agam district where roads were transformed into murky brown rivers and villages covered by thick mud, rocks, and uprooted trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scores of rescue personnel were searching through a river around the Anai Valley Waterfall area in Tanah Datar district where tons of mud, rocks and trees were left from flash floods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rescuers were focused on finding four people from a group of seven that were swept away with their cars. Three other bodies were pulled out on Monday, said Abdul Malik, who heads the Search and Rescue Office in Padang, the provincial capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;With many missing and some remote areas still unreachable, the death toll was likely to rise,&quot; Malik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy rains cause frequent landslides and flash floods in Indonesia, an archipelago nation of more than 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near floodplains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/disasters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The weekend disaster&lt;/a&gt; came just two months after heavy rains triggered flash floods and a landslide in West Sumatra, killing at least 26 people and leaving 11 others missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A surprise eruption of Mount Marapi late last year killed 23 climbers. The mountain’s sudden eruptions are difficult to predict because the source is shallow and near the peak, according to Indonesia’s Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marapi has been active since an eruption in January 2024 that caused no casualties. It is among more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia. The country is prone to seismic upheaval because of its location on the Pacific &quot;Ring of Fire,&quot; an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Mine authorities in southern Poland say that two miners are dead and one is missing while 12 others were hurt following a cave-in at the Myslowice-Wesola coal mine.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two miners were killed and one remains missing after a cave-in at the Myslowice-Wesola coal mine in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;southern Poland&lt;/a&gt; early Tuesday in which 12 other miners were hurt, mining authorities said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cave-in happened around 3:30 a.m. some 2,800 feet underground in an area where 15 miners were working, said Rajmund Horst, the deputy head of the company that runs the mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said two of the miners located &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/disaster-response&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;by rescuers&lt;/a&gt; and brought to the surface were declared dead, while one was being taken to the hospital. Eleven other miners were earlier brought to the surface with various injuries. Nine of them remain hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kentucky-house-votes-decrease-emergency-safety-measures-small-coal-mines&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KENTUCKY HOUSE VOTES TO DECREASE EMERGENCY SAFETY MEASURES IN SMALL COAL MINES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rescuers were still searching for one missing miner but had no contact with him. Six teams of rescuers were working in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/disasters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The accident&lt;/a&gt; happened near the coal face, an area especially exposed to cave-ins or explosions of methane gas, which is present in the rock in many Polish coal mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the second cave-in at the Myslowice-Wesola mine this year, following one on April 17 that killed one miner. Two other coal mine workers were killed in accidents inside other mines in Poland this year, while in 2023, 15 miners were killed in on-the job accidents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>North Carolina Republican congressional runoff shows Trump&apos;s sway in GOP state politics</title>
                    
                    <description>In a Republican runoff for North Carolina&amp;apos;s new 13th Congressional District, Kelly Daughtry suspended her campaign after her opponent, Brad Knott, received Trump&amp;apos;s endorsement.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Republican primary runoff for a North Carolina congressional district on Tuesday could demonstrate yet again the strong influence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; has on GOP politics across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voters will choose between attorneys Kelly Daughtry and Brad Knott in the runoff for the reconfigured 13th Congressional District. Daughtry finished first, and Knott second, in the March 5 primary. GOP candidates for the statewide offices of lieutenant governor and state auditor are also on runoff ballots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump endorsed Knott in April. Weeks later, Daughtry suspended her campaign, when early voting was already underway. The runoff continued on Tuesday with both names on the ballot. Knott must win the most votes to ensure victory; he&apos;s reminded his supporters that they need to get out and vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/north-carolina-gop-elects-trump-endorsed-executive-director-next-chairman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NORTH CAROLINA GOP ELECTS TRUMP-ENDORSED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AS ITS NEXT CHAIRMAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Daughtry were to win, but turned down the nomination, local Republicans would choose a replacement to take on Democrat Frank Pierce in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, won North Carolina, the country’s ninth-largest state, in both the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, and the state is expected to be a presidential battleground this fall. Turnout for Tuesday’s runoffs is expected to be very low, however. Democrats have no primaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former president has a history of intervening &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/north-carolina&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; politics. This year marks the second time he has endorsed a Daughtry opponent; in a 2022 primary for the 13th District, he backed her challenger and then-political newcomer Bo Hines, who won the primary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump also endorsed then-U.S. Rep. Ted Budd in the 2022 GOP primary for U.S. Senate. Budd easily defeated former Gov. Pat McCrory, then went on to win the general election. In the recent March primary, Trump also backed first-time candidate Addison McDowell, who ended up winning the 6th Congressional District race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 14 candidates had initially competed this year for the 13th District seat, which represents all or parts of eight counties in or close to the capital of Raleigh. The district was retooled to the right by the Republican-controlled legislature, prompting current Democratic U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel not to run for reelection. The seat is one of three the GOP expects to add to the U.S. House from North Carolina &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-makes-bold-2024-presidential-election-prediction-about-longtime-blue-state&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in the fall election&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to redistricting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daughtry was the top fundraiser and the top vote-getter in the March 5 primary, but she failed to garner at least 30% of the vote, the amount required to avoid a runoff. The second-place finisher must officially request a runoff for it to take place, and Knott did so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite those advantages, Daughtry essentially ended her campaign earlier this month in response to Trump’s April 5 endorsement of Knott, a former assistant U.S. attorney from Raleigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daughtry said the endorsement made clear to her &quot;that a pathway to victory is no longer feasible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I believe in the democratic process and respect the endorsement of our President,&quot; she said in a written statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a social media endorsement, Trump called Knott a &quot;Strong Patriot&quot; who would support law enforcement, secure the U.S.-Mexico border and protect gun rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Daughtry, the daughter of a longtime Republican legislative leader, Trump called her a &quot;RINO&quot; — Republican in Name Only — and someone who &quot;is no friend to MAGA,&quot; a reference to Trump’s &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; slogan. He said Daughtry had contributed to the campaigns of some Democratic candidates in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other races Tuesday, the runoff for lieutenant governor features Hal Weatherman, a former chief of staff to then-Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, and Forsyth County District Attorney Jim O’Neill. Forest finished first in the primary&apos;s initial 11-candidate field. The winner will take on Democratic state Sen. Rachel Hunt, daughter of former four-term Gov. Jim Hunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GOP auditor’s runoff features candidates Jack Clark and Dave Boliek. The winner will take on Democratic State Auditor Jessica Holmes. Libertarian Party candidates also are running for auditor and lieutenant governor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOP runoff voting is open to registered Republicans and unaffiliated voters who either voted in the March Republican primaries or didn’t vote at all.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Speaker Johnson to attend Trump trial in Manhattan in show of support</title>
                    
                    <description>Speaker Mike Johnson is the latest GOP official and Trump ally to appear at the Manhattan criminal court where the former president is on trial.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is expected in downtown Manhattan on Tuesday morning to show solidarity with former President Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ny-v-trump-prosecutors-resume-questioning-michael-cohen-testimony-stormy-daniels-payment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;during his criminal trial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Johnson told Fox News Digital early on Tuesday that he would be in New York City for the trial, making him the latest Trump ally in Congress to appear beside the ex-president in the Manhattan Criminal Court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&apos;s also expected to speak with reporters outside of the courthouse after attending the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michael-cohen-testifies-he-secretly-recorded-trump-lead-up-2016-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL COHEN TESTIFIES HE SECRETLY RECORDED TRUMP IN LEAD-UP TO 2016 ELECTION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson is slated to be there at the same time as Vivek Ramaswamy, the former 2024 Republican primary candidate-turned-possible Trump running mate choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former president&apos;s trial is related to accusations he falsified business records to cover up a payment to adult film star &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-unleashes-stormy-daniels-testimony-trump-trial-shes-bad-witness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Stormy Daniels&lt;/a&gt; during the 2016 election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson, who has long been a Trump ally but has grown significantly closer to him since becoming speaker in October, has criticized the prosecutions against Trump, including the Manhattan case, as inherently political.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-cohens-credibility-issues-brazen-tiktok-usage-raise-media-eyebrows-ahead-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL COHEN&apos;S CREDIBILITY ISSUES, BRAZEN TIKTOK USAGE RAISE MEDIA EYEBROWS AHEAD OF TESTIMONY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;One of the things that is also in jeopardy right now is our judicial branch, and it&apos;s our system of government itself. And I don&apos;t think we can say often enough here, how much that has been abused under this administration with local prosecutors, state prosecutors, and at the federal level, who are using lawfare,&quot; Johnson said during a press conference last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They&apos;re using our judicial system to get the most out of that, and I think the most egregious one is what is being done to Donald Trump right now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Manhattan trial specifically, Johnson said, &quot;That case should never have been brought.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That case is being orchestrated by Democrats, supporters of President Biden, who are trying to make a name for themselves,&quot; Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ny-v-trump-cohen-testifies-paying-stormy-daniels-his-own-pocket&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NY V TRUMP: COHEN TESTIFIES TO PAYING STORMY DANIELS FROM HIS OWN POCKET&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump appears to have played a critical role in helping Johnson keep his job as speaker amid an ouster threat led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., by showing public support for the Louisiana Republican even as one of his top supporters and campaign surrogates called for his firing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Trump allies in Congress who have made appearances at the Manhattan courthouse so far include Sens. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/sen-rick-scott&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rick Scott. R-Fla.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An unknown number of orcas rammed a sailing yacht in Moroccan waters in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Strait of Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday morning, causing it to later sink, the latest attack in a trend that has been terrifying sailors in the region for the past four years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest incident took place at around 9 a.m. when crew members aboard the 50-foot-long Alboran Cognac called rescue services for help, saying that their ship had been damaged by the apex predators about 14 miles from Cape Spartel, local outlet El Pais reports, citing Spain&apos;s maritime rescue service. Cape Spartel is located at the southern entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A helicopter was mobilized and the oil tanker MT Lascaux which was sailing nearby was also asked to provide assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/killer-whales-may-be-attacking-boats-revenge-injured-matriarch-scientists&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KILLER WHALES MAY BE ATTACKING BOATS AS REVENGE FOR INJURED MATRIARCH: SCIENTISTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tanker eventually rescued the two people onboard and transported them to Gibraltar. The yacht was left adrift and eventually sank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident is the latest example of recurring orca rammings around the Gibraltar Strait that separates Europe from Africa and off the Atlantic coast of Portugal and northwestern Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts believe them to involve a subpopulation of about 15 individuals given the designation &quot;Gladis.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the research group An Atlantic Orca Task Force (GTOA), which tracks populations of the Iberian orca subspecies, there have been nearly 700 interactions since orca attacks on ships in the region were first reported in May 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/video-shows-killer-whale-near-spain-biting-rudders-off-boat&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIDEO SHOWS KILLER WHALE NEAR SPAIN BITING RUDDERS OFF BOAT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear why the orcas are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/great-outdoors/boating&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;targeting boats&lt;/a&gt; but some experts believe they may be acts of revenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marine biologist Alfredo Lopez Fernandez told Live Science previously that the lead whale, a female orca scientists have called White Gladis, suffered a &quot;critical moment of agony,&quot; likely a collision with a boat or entanglement with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/great-outdoors/fishing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;fishing line&lt;/a&gt;, that turned her more aggressive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other theories include it being a playful manifestation of the mammals&apos; curiosity, a social fad or the intentional targeting of what they perceive as competitors for their favorite prey, the local bluefin tuna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All but a handful resulted in only minor injuries or damage. However, the attacks have grown more frequent and a few have led to boats sinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, in August last year, Phep Philouceros, 77, was sailing off the coast of Cape Vincent in Portugal, when his boat was attacked by orcas. The sailor, who has 55 years of experience, said the orcas continued for 30 minutes — even following the boat as it was towed to shore. He caught part of the attack on video. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Peter Aitken and Reuters contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Ron DeSantis addresses rumors about first lady Casey DeSantis&apos; political future</title>
                    
                    <description>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis shot down rumors that his wife, First Lady Casey DeSantis, would run for governor to succeed him, saying she has &amp;quot;zero&amp;quot; interest in doing so.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Florida Gov. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ron-desantis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ron DeSantis&lt;/a&gt; on Monday shot down rumors that his wife, first lady Casey DeSantis, would run for governor in 2026 when he leaves office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republican governor addressed speculation about his wife&apos;s political ambitions at an event in Coral Gables. Recent polls have suggested that Casey DeSantis would be strongly favored in a hypothetical Republican primary for governor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about those polls, DeSantis smiled and told reporters, &quot;If I had to characterize her interest in getting into the political thicket as a candidate, I would say, I would characterize it as zero. But, you know, I think it’s because she has had a front row seat on all the nonsense that goes on when you do it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bill-expand-floridas-safe-haven-law-now-desantis-desk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BILL TO EXPAND FLORIDA&apos;S ‘SAFE HAVEN’ LAW NOW ON DESANTIS&apos; DESK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He went on to say that the reason some people have said the first lady should run for governor is based on her successful programs, including Hope Florida, a service that helps people on government welfare transition back to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/casey-desantis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Casey DeSantis&lt;/a&gt; was a constant presence on the campaign trail as her husband, the governor, mounted an ultimately unsuccessful bid for the 2024 Republican nomination. Political observers and supporters often remarked that the first lady&apos;s charisma and inspiring story as a cancer survivor made her the highlight of her husband&apos;s events. The couple&apos;s young children, ages ranging from 3 to 7, would at times accompany them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/what-ron-desantis-can-do-to-help-donald-trump-in-presidential-election-with-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAJOR GOP DONOR REVEALS HOW TRUMP&apos;S FORMER RIVAL CAN BOOST HIM OVER BIDEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Ohio native, DeSantis graduated from the College of Charleston with a Bachelor of Science in economics as well as a minor in French. Before her husband&apos;s election as governor in 2018, DeSantis enjoyed a career as a television host, reporter and anchor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/casey-desantis-gets-candid-cancer-battle-role-florida-first-lady&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;interview with Fox News&apos; Harris Faulkner&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, DeSantis said &quot;humility&quot; is what defined her as the first lady of the Sunshine State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-desantis-meet-privately-several-hours-miami&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP, DESANTIS MEET PRIVATELY FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN MIAMI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think one who looks at the role with a lot of humility,&quot; Casey said. &quot;It isn&apos;t about me. It is about being in a position to be able to do good on behalf of the people of this state and hopefully of this country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent polls have suggested that DeSantis would be a favored Republican candidate for governor were she to enter the race to succeed her husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A poll released in April by Florida Atlantic University and Mainstreet Research showed 38% of Florida Republicans surveyed would support the first lady in a head-to-head matchup with Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., a firebrand House conservative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another University of North Florida Public Opinion Lab survey from November 2023 showed Casey DeSantis with 22% support in a crowded field of potential GOP candidates. However, 40% of respondents remained undecided in that survey. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A missing New Mexico man who is believed to have been traveling the Colorado River with his dog on a homemade raft has been found dead at the Grand Canyon.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The National Park Service says a missing New Mexico man who is &quot;believed to have attempted travel down the Colorado River with his dog on a wooden raft&quot; has been found dead inside &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/national-parks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Grand Canyon National Park.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Robison, 58, of Santa Fe, was discovered by park rangers in the Colorado River on Friday, according to the NPS.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency previously said on April 21, a champagne 2001 Toyota Tacoma belonging to Robison &quot;was found abandoned at Lee’s Ferry in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area&quot; and that his whereabouts were unknown at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is believed he may have attempted to go down the Colorado River with his dog, who is a Welsh Corgi, on a self-made raft,&quot; they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/idaho-man-arrested-kicking-yellowstone-bison-drunk-officials&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IDAHO MAN ARRESTED FOR KICKING YELLOWSTONE BISON WHILE DRUNK, OFFICIALS SAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robison’s body is now being examined by the Coconino County Medical Examiner and the NPS is investigating the incident. The NPS says &quot;initial information&quot; indicates that the body is of Robison. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of his death is unclear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/arizona-hikers-death-grand-canyon-trail-marks-10th-fatality-national-park-this-year&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;an Arizona hiker died&lt;/a&gt; on a popular Grand Canyon hiking trail in November 2023 in what was the 10th death that year at the national park. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NPS identified that hiker as 65-year-old James Handschy of Oracle, Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handschy had set off for a hike from the South Rim to the river and back along the Bright Angel Trail, the agency said, a roundtrip of about 18 miles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/climber-alaska-denali-park-national-park-dies-2-fall-1000-feet-off-mountain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLIMBER IN ALASKA’S DENALI NATIONAL PARK DIES AFTER FALLING OFF MOUNTAIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2023, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/grand-canyon-hiker-dies-attempting-rim-rim-trek-single-day&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;another Grand Canyon hiker died&lt;/a&gt; while trying to walk rim to rim in one day, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranjith Varma, 55, of Manassas, Virginia, was attempting to trek from the South to North Rim on Sept. 9 when he became unresponsive along the North Kaibab Trail, approximately one mile south of Cottonwood Campground, the National Park Service said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rangers responded to the emergency call about the hiker in distress and deployed a helicopter with search and rescue personnel, the NPS said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bystanders performed CPR until the rangers arrived. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Stephen Sorace contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Authorities in New Caledonia have implemented a two-day curfew and banned gatherings following violent unrest in Noumea and other areas, officials said.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Authorities in the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia announced a two-day curfew and banned gatherings on Tuesday after violent unrest erupted in the capital of Noumea and other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Paris, the French Interior Ministry announced that police reinforcements were being sent to island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The territory’s top &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/france&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;French official&lt;/a&gt;, High Commissioner Louis Le Franc, said 46 security forces had been injured in the unrest and 48 people had been arrested. No serious civilian injuries were reported, he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/magnitude-7-5-quake-strikes-in-pacific-near-new-caledonia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAGNITUDE 7.5 QUAKE STRIKES IN PACIFIC NEAR NEW CALEDONIA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Le Franc said Noumea was wracked by &quot;high intensity&quot; disturbances overnight Monday to Tuesday that damaged numerous stores and video surveillance equipment. Schools were closed on Tuesday, and most business and shops, some damaged in the unrest, remained shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French media reported that the unrest started with protests against voting reforms that French lawmakers are debating in Paris which would increase the number of people who could cast ballots in New Caledonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Caledonia, colonized by Napoleon’s nephew in the 19th century, is a vast archipelago of about 270,000 people east of Australia that is 10 time zones ahead of Paris and hosts a French &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;military base&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions in the archipelago between native Kanaks seeking independence and descendants of European colonizers who want to remain part of France have been simmering for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/new-caledonia-in-pacific-to-vote-on-independence-from-france&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW CALEDONIA IN PACIFIC TO VOTE ON INDEPENDENCE FROM FRANCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Le Franc said in an interview with French broadcaster BFM that clashes between police forces and pro-independence protesters and opponents of the constitutional reform occurred overnight in Mont-Dore, a town in the southeast near Nouméa. Shots were fired at gendarmes &quot;from high caliber weapons and hunting rifles,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of cars were set on fire and dozens of businesses and homes could be seen in flames on videos posted on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The situation remains extremely tense,&quot; Le Franc said. He said internal security troops and civil security forces have been mobilized to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gatherings on public roads and in public places have been prohibited in the municipalities of Nouméa, Dumbéa, Mont-Dore and Païta, and all travel on public roads and in public places there was banned from Tuesday afternoon until Wednesday morning, except for health and public emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Le Franc called for calm and &quot;strict compliance with the measures taken to ensure the safety of the population.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The archipelago’s population incudes native Kanaks, who once suffered from strict segregation policies and widespread discrimination, and descendants of European colonizers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A peace deal between rival factions was reached in 1988. A decade later, France promised in the Noumea Agreement to grant New Caledonia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;political power&lt;/a&gt; and broad autonomy and hold up to three successive referendums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three referendums were organized between 2018 to 2021 and a majority of voters chose to remain part of France instead of backing independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Caledonia became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III — Napoleon’s nephew and heir — and was used for decades as a prison colony. It became an overseas territory after World War II, with French citizenship granted to all Kanaks in 1957.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Chiefs&apos; Harrison Butker goes after Biden over abortion stance as a Catholic</title>
                    
                    <description>Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker ripped President Biden for his stance on abortion as a practicing Catholic at a commencement speech at Benedictine College.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Super Bowl champion kicker &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-star-kicker-harrison-butker-credits-prayer-sidelines-mental-fortitude&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Harrison Butker&lt;/a&gt; took aim at President Biden in his commencement address at Benedictine College in Kansas on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kansas City Chiefs&lt;/a&gt; players specifically pointed to Biden’s &quot;delusional&quot; stance on abortion as a member of the Catholic faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I’m sure to many people it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro-choice,&quot; he said, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outkick.com/sports/harrison-butker-rips-biden-pride-month-epic-speech&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;via OutKick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He is not alone. From the man behind the COVID lockdowns, to the people pushing dangerous gender ideologies onto the youth of America, they all have a glaring thing in common — they are Catholic. This is an important reminder that being Catholic alone doesn’t cut it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Butker implored the graduates to understand and &quot;stop pretending that the church of nice is a winning proposal&quot; and to &quot;never mistake charity for cowardice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lions-jared-goff-agrees-massive-4-year-extension-remain-franchise-qb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIONS&apos; JARED GOFF AGREES TO MASSIVE 4-YEAR EXTENSION TO REMAIN FRANCHISE QB FOR YEARS TO COME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion,&quot; Butker added. &quot;We fear speaking truth, because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Butker also hit out at Biden over &quot;poor leadership&quot; that had &quot;negatively affected&quot; their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique,&quot; he added. &quot;The bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for the degenerate cultural values and media all stem from pervasiveness of disorder.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The veteran kicker has not been one to shy away from his opinion on abortion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-harrison-butker-makes-strong-defense-unborn-children-greatest-victims-our-society&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;said in March&lt;/a&gt; in an interview with ETWN News that unborn babies &quot;are the greatest victims of our society.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>UK&apos;s Cameron discussed Ukraine-Russia peace deal with Trump: report</title>
                    
                    <description>British Foreign Secretary David Cameron reportedly floated a possible Ukraine-Russia peace deal during his visit with former President Donald Trump.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;British Foreign Secretary David Cameron reportedly discussed with former President Trump – the presumptive Republican presidential nominee – a potential peace deal between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ukraine and Russia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a source who spoke to The Sunday Times, Cameron met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida last month and told the former president that new U.S. aid would help Ukraine hold its front lines and give Trump the &quot;best possible conditions&quot; to attempt to secure an agreement with Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source reportedly said that Cameron asked Trump: &quot;What are the best conditions in which you as president can make a deal in January? It’s both sides holding their lines and paying a price for that.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That contradicts the United Kingdom&apos;s position that a peace agreement would be a Ukrainian matter, and Cameron has said publicly that &quot;peace comes through strength, not through appeasement and weakness.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/blinken-makes-unannounced-diplomatic-trip-ukraine-after-congress-approves-military-aid&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BLINKEN MAKES UNANNOUNCED DIPLOMATIC TRIP TO UKRAINE AFTER CONGRESS APPROVES $60B IN MILITARY AID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the report Monday afternoon, a spokesperson for U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Britain&apos;s &quot;position has not changed&quot; and that &quot;Putin must fail.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;It is crucial, now more than ever in this conflict, that Putin is sent a very clear message that we will support Ukraine for as long as is necessary,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;I’ve seen some anonymous source briefing. We do not recognize those reports.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reporters also pressed Sunak about the report in central London on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraines-kharkiv-residents-remain-defiant-russia-launches-new-offensive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UKRAINE&apos;S KHARKIV RESIDENTS REMAIN DEFIANT AS RUSSIA LAUNCHES NEW OFFENSIVE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I haven’t seen this Sunday Times article, so forgive me for that,&quot; Sunak said, according to Politico. &quot;But what I can tell you is that you we have led when it comes to Ukraine.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Investment in Ukraine’s security is investment in our security. Our NATO allies are already worried about the prospect of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;if Putin succeeds&lt;/a&gt;, that they’ll be next –  with all the consequences that would bring,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron said last month the meeting &quot;was entirely in line with precedent with government ministers meeting with opposition politicians,&quot; adding that he and Trump discussed a &quot;range of important geopolitical subjects&quot; and that a victory for Ukraine is &quot;vital for American and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;European security&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement in April, Trump’s campaign said the meeting was held &quot;to discuss several issues impacting both countries,&quot; including upcoming elections in both Britain and the United States, the implications of Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/nato&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;need for NATO allies&lt;/a&gt; to meet their commitments on defense spending and &quot;ending the killing in Ukraine.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>David McBride, a former army lawyer, has been sentenced to nearly six years in prison for leaking classified information about alleged Australian war crimes in Afghanistan.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An Australian judge sentenced a former army lawyer to almost six years in prison on Tuesday for leaking to the media classified information that exposed allegations of Australian war crimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/afghanistan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David McBride, 60, was sentenced in a court in the capital, Canberra, to five years and eight months in prison after pleading guilty to three charges including theft and sharing with members of the press documents classified as secret. He had faced a potential life sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice David Mossop ordered McBride to serve 27 months in prison before he can be considered for release on parole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/judge-rules-australias-decorated-war-veteran-unlawfully-killed-pows-committed-war-crimes-afghanistan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUDGE RULES AUSTRALIA&apos;S MOST DECORATED WAR VETERAN UNLAWFULLY KILLED POWS, COMMITTED WAR CRIMES IN AFGHANISTAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rights advocates argue that McBride&apos;s conviction and sentencing before any alleged war criminal he helped expose reflected a lack of whistleblower protections &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/australia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McBride addressed his supporters as he walked his dog to the front door of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court to be sentenced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’ve never been so proud to be an Australian as today. I may have broken the law, but I did not break my oath to the people of Australia and the soldiers that keep us safe,&quot; McBride told the cheering crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for McBride, Mark Davis, said that his legal team would appeal a ruling that prevented McBride from mounting a defense. Mossop ruled in November last year that McBride had no duty as an army officer beyond following orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We know that the Australian military teach a much broader notion of what the duty of an officer is in a battle field than to follow orders,&quot; Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/australias-most-decorated-war-veteran-appeals-court-ruling-blamed-unlawful-killing-afghans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUSTRALIA&apos;S MOST DECORATED WAR VETERAN APPEALS COURT RULING THAT BLAMED HIM FOR UNLAWFUL KILLING OF AFGHANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis said the severity of the sentence also created grounds for appeal, but their effort would focus on the earlier ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McBride’s documents formed the basis of an Australian Broadcasting Corp. seven-part television series in 2017 that contained war crime allegations including Australian Special Air Service Regiment soldiers killing unarmed Afghan men and children in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police raided the ABC’s Sydney headquarters in 2019 in search of evidence of a leak, but decided against charging the two reporters responsible for the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sentencing, Mossop said he did not accept McBride’s explanation that he thought a court would vindicate him for acting in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McBride’s argument that his suspicions that the higher echelons of the Australian Defense Force were engaged in criminal activity obliged him to disclose classified papers &quot;didn’t reflect reality,&quot; Mossop said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Australian military report released in 2020 found evidence that Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians. The report recommended 19 current and former soldiers face criminal investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police are working with the Office of the Special Investigator, an Australian investigation agency established in 2021, to build cases against elite SAS and Commando Regiments troops who served in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former SAS trooper Oliver Schulz last year became the first of these veterans to be charged with a war crime. He is accused of shooting dead a noncombatant man in a wheat field in Uruzgan province in 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also last year, a civil court found Australia’s most decorated living war veteran Ben Roberts-Smith had likely unlawfully killed four Afghans. He has not been criminally charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human Rights Watch’s Australia director Daniela Gavshon said McBride’s sentencing was evidence an Australia’s whistleblowing laws needed exemptions in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is a stain on Australia’s reputation that some of its soldiers have been accused of war crimes in Afghanistan, and yet the first person convicted in relation to these crimes is a whistleblower not the abusers,&quot; Gavshon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;David McBride’s jail sentence reinforces that whistleblowers are not protected by Australian law. It will create a chilling effect on those taking risks to push for transparency and accountability – cornerstones of democracy,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some lawmakers from minor parties and independents raised McBride&apos;s sentencing in Parliament on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greens lawmaker Elizabeth Watson-Brown told Prime Minister Anthony Albanese that McBride had been imprisoned for the &quot;crime of telling the truth about war crimes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why won’t your government admit that our whistleblower laws are broken and commit to urgent reform to keep whistleblowers like Mr. McBride out of jail?&quot; Watson-Brown asked the prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albanese declined to answer, saying it might prejudice McBride&apos;s appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m not going to say anything here that interferes with a matter that is quite clearly going to continue to be before the courts,&quot; Albanese told Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Wilkie, a former government intelligence analyst whistleblower who’s now an independent lawmaker, said Australian governments &quot;hate whistleblowers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The government wanted to punish David McBride and to send a signal to other insiders to stay on the inside and to stay silent,&quot; Wilkie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilkie quit his intelligence job in Australia&apos;s Office of National Assessments days before Australian troops &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;joined U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and British forces in the 2003 Iraq invasion. He publicly argued that Iraq didn’t pose enough of a threat to warrant invasion and that there was no evidence linking Iraq’s government to al-Qaida.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Georgian parliament holds final reading of divisive &apos;Russian law&apos; proposal on foreign influence in media</title>
                    
                    <description>Thousands gathered to protest again as Georgia&amp;apos;s parliament held its third and final reading of a divisive foreign influence bill known to critics as &amp;quot;the Russia law.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Georgia’s parliament on Tuesday began the third and final reading of a divisive bill that sparked weeks of mass protests, with critics seeing it as a threat to democratic freedoms and the country’s aspirations to join the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill would require media and nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofits to register as &quot;pursuing the interests of a foreign power&quot; if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/georgia-police-arrest-dozens-protesting-russian-law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;large crowd of demonstrators&lt;/a&gt; gathered on Tuesday morning in front of the parliament, amid a heavy presence of riot police, to protest the bill once again, as lawmakers were discussing it in the lead-up to a vote. Over the weekend, thousands poured into the streets of the Georgian capital Tbilisi, and many stayed in front of the parliament until Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/georgians-protest-proposed-law-restricting-foreign-influence-media-parliament-approves-final-vote&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GEORGIANS PROTEST PROPOSED LAW RESTRICTING &apos;FOREIGN INFLUENCE&apos; IN MEDIA AS PARLIAMENT APPROVES FINAL VOTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opposition denounces the bill as &quot;the Russian law,&quot; because Moscow uses similar legislation to crack down on independent news media, nonprofits and activists critical of the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill is nearly identical to one that the governing Georgian Dream party was pressured to withdraw last year after street protests. Renewed demonstrations have rocked Georgia for weeks, with demonstrators scuffling with police, who used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government says the bill is necessary to stem what it deems as harmful foreign influence over the country’s politics and to prevent unspecified foreign actors from trying to destabilize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party, has vowed to veto the law, but Georgian Dream has a majority sufficient to override a presidential veto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislature approved a second reading of the bill earlier this month, after protests that drew tens of thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European Council President Charles Michel on Tuesday spoke of Georgia in Copenhagen at a conference on democracy, and said that &quot;if they want &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/the-european-union&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to join the EU&lt;/a&gt;, they have to respect the fundamental principles of the rule of law and the democratic principles.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A falling rock struck and killed a hiker in North Fork of Lone Pine Creek Trail near Mt. Whitney in California, the third hiker fatality in a week.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A hiker was killed near Mt. Whitney on Sunday after being struck by a falling rock, marking the third fatality within a week near &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;California’s highest peak,&lt;/a&gt; authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hiker was in the North Fork of Lone Pine Creek Trail when bystanders reported that a rock fell and severely injured the individual, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Inyo County Sheriff’s Office&lt;/a&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search and rescue crews immediately responded to the scene via helicopter and lowered a team member down to the site of the accident. Rescuers determined the injured hiker had died from their injuries, the sheriff’s office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hiker’s body was then airlifted to Lone Pine and turned over to the Inyo County Coroner. Officials did not immediately release the identity of the hiker or provide additional details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/bodies-missing-hikers-recovered-identified-after-disappearing-hike-up-californias-highest-peak-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BODIES OF MISSING HIKERS RECOVERED, IDENTIFIED AFTER DISAPPEARING ON HIKE UP CALIFORNIA&apos;S HIGHEST PEAK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the third hiker fatality in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/great-outdoors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mt. Whitney region&lt;/a&gt; within a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bodies of two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/missing-persons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;missing hikers&lt;/a&gt; were recovered from the north face of Mount Whitney on Thursday. The hikers were identified as Andrew Niziol, 28, a resident of South Lake Tahoe, and Patty Bolan, 29. The pair were on a long-term hiking trip across the state of California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/utah-hunter-finds-skeletal-remains-man-missing-since-2019-remote-mountains&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;UTAH HUNTER FINDS SKELETAL REMAINS OF MAN MISSING SINCE 2019 IN REMOTE MOUNTAINS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials cautioned those visiting the area to be aware of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/weather&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;changing weather conditions&lt;/a&gt; as the seasons shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Early spring conditions prevail on the mountain, with treacherous steep snow, loose rock, and variable weather,&quot; the Inyo County Sheriff’s Office said. &quot;Parties venturing onto Mt. Whitney should stay together, turn around before deteriorating conditions become unmanageable, make responsible decisions, and be prepared and fit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mt. Whitney is the highest mountain in the contiguous U.S., reaching an elevation of 14,505 feet. More than 25,000 visitors per year seek to summit Mt. Whitney, according to the National Park Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Stepheny Price contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Austin Rivers, the veteran &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NBA point guard&lt;/a&gt;, sparked a debate on X recently when he said he could take 30 players from the NBA right now to play in the NFL, but it would not happen if football players tried to get on the court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/seattle-seahawks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Seattle Seahawks&lt;/a&gt; running back Kenneth Walker III begs to differ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No,&quot; he said bluntly to Fox News Digital while discussing his new partnership with RECOVER 180, an all-new, all-organic sports drink from beverage powerhouse Lance Collins, creator of BODYARMOR, among other drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think there are definitely a few athletes in the NBA that can play in the league or try to play in the league. But I think it’s the other way around. I feel like you can take NFL players and put them on the court.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Rivers gave options like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/minnesota-timberwolves&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Minnesota Timberwolves&lt;/a&gt;&apos; Anthony Edwards, New Orleans Pelicans&apos; Zion Williamson and LeBron James (who has been involved in this debate before), Walker pointed to his Seahawks teammate, DK Metcalf, as just one example of an NFL star who could thrive on an NBA court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 6 feet, 4 inches tall, weighing 236 pounds, Metcalf is a freakish athlete with speed and leaping ability that dazzles considering his size, and he put that to the test in last year&apos;s NBA All-Star Celebrity Game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metcalf was not playing against the pros, but he was entertaining everyone with a performance filled with dunks, blocks and fast break points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Definitely him because people saw he won the MVP [of the game],&quot; Walker said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/jj-watt-roasts-austin-rivers-implying-nba-players-could-play-nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J.J. WATT ROASTS AUSTIN RIVERS FOR IMPLYING NBA PLAYERS COULD PLAY IN THE NFL: ‘YOU DON’T GOT A JOB IN EITHER&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate has lasted decades with players in both leagues believing they are the superior athletes, especially those who have played the other sport at some time in their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivers said it on ESPN’s &quot;The Pat McAfee Show&quot; earlier this month, when the former NFL punter immediately questioned him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You cannot take 30 NFL players and put them in the NBA,&quot; Rivers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future Hall of Famer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/j-j-watt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;J.J. Watt&lt;/a&gt; jumped the gun with his response to Rivers on X by saying, &quot;You don’t have a job in either right now, go head and try it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivers responded to Watt by not just adding his examples of Edwards, Williamson and a prime James, but he also said he meant no disrespect. He simply wanted to have the debate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My comments weren’t meant to be disrespectful,&quot; he said, to which Watt apologized in a later post. &quot;Only a point to how athletically gifted SOME NBA players are…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now give me yours for the NFL to the NBA…I’ll wait. Notice I never said myself btw. So easy on the shade towards me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivers returned to &quot;The Pat McAfee Show,&quot; where he claimed former NFL receiver Brandon Marshall and Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley hit him up to say he was right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Walker puts Metcalf into the conversation, and there are others like Cleveland Browns edge Myles Garrett, Tampa Bay Buccaneers receiver Mike Evans and many others from the NFL who have been mentioned by sports fans on social media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until someone pulls a Deion Sanders or Bo Jackson and plays both sports at the same time professionally, this debate will simply be about who presents the better argument. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker is not one who is going to test those boundaries, as the Michigan State product is rather looking forward to his third year in the NFL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was not too happy with his performance last year, because he could not get back-to-back 1,000-yard rushing seasons, though he finished just short with 905 yards and eight rushing touchdowns. However, he is putting in the work at the team facility during OTAs to make sure he is prepared to get four digits in the rushing column in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help him through those tough workouts, Walker uses RECOVER 180 to make sure that he&apos;s staying hydrated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Usually I feel like with drinks that’s something for recovery or healthy, it doesn’t taste as good,&quot; Walker said of RECOVER 180, where his favorite flavor is Fruit Punch. &quot;It’ll be good for your body, but it doesn’t taste as good. With RECOVER 180, it tastes good, and it’s good for you. So it’s a win-win.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Hong Kong calls for respect of trade offices after UK staffer charged with espionage</title>
                    
                    <description>Hong Kong has called on foreign governments to respect the city&amp;apos;s trade offices abroad after a staff member in its London branch was charged in Britain.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/hong-kong&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hong Kong&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; leader on Tuesday urged foreign governments to respect its overseas-based trade offices after a staff member in its London branch was charged in Britain for allegedly working for the Chinese city&apos;s intelligence service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive John Lee said his administration had demanded the British government provide an explanation about the prosecution of Bill Yuen, the office manager of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London. Lee said any attempt to make unwarranted allegations against the city’s government is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British police allege that Yuen, along with Chi Leung (Peter) Wai and Matthew Trickett, agreed to engage in information gathering, surveillance and acts of deception that were likely to materially assist the Hong Kong intelligence service. The trio was charged under a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/national-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;national security&lt;/a&gt; act that gave British police additional powers to tackle foreign espionage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/3-men-charged-uk-allegedly-collaborating-hong-kong-intelligence-service&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 MEN CHARGED IN UK FOR ALLEGEDLY COLLABORATING WITH HONG KONG INTELLIGENCE SERVICE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his weekly news briefing, Lee said the duties of the trade office in London are to foster ties with various sectors in Britain and promote Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Any attempt to interfere with the work of the ETO offices in different places will be against free trade and free economy and will harm the economy of the countries that try to do bad things to the operation of the ETO offices,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday&apos;s prosecution is likely to sour relations between Britain and China. Chinese authorities in both the U.K. and Hong Kong have criticized the charges, saying they were the latest in a series of &quot;groundless and slanderous&quot; accusations that the British government has leveled against China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry&apos;s spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Tuesday that China is gravely concerned about the prosecution of the Chinese national and called on Britain to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For some time, the British side has been hyping up the so-called Chinese spying and Chinese cyberattacks,&quot; he said. &quot;China firmly opposes such despicable acts of political manipulation in the name of justice and national security.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, British prosecutors charged two men, including a former researcher working in the U.K. Parliament, with spying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;for China&lt;/a&gt;. The Chinese Embassy called the allegations fabricated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak warned the U.K. was facing an increasingly dangerous future due to threats from an &quot;axis of authoritarian states,&quot; including Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong has always been a specific source of tensions between Britain and Beijing. The former British colony returned to China in 1997 under an agreement that included promises by Beijing to keep for 50 years a degree of self-government and freedoms of assembly, speech and press that are not allowed on the Communist-ruled Chinese mainland. Critics say those freedoms have all but disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three men were granted bail in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;London court&lt;/a&gt; on Monday and their next court appearance is scheduled for May 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong media reported that Yuen is a former police officer in Hong Kong. The Associated Press found Yuen’s name printed in local police publicity materials online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the news conference on Tuesday, Lee also responded to reports of a photo he had taken with Yuen for a news article years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This photo appears to be a graduation group photo,&quot; he said. &quot;My impression of this person is solely based on this photo.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Morning Glory: Trump’s veepstakes is close to wrapping up</title>
                    
                    <description>Trump is getting close to making his vice presidential choice and the veepstakes is heating up. Will it be a North Dakota governor or one of the others in the Trump circle?</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m calling it,&quot; declared &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Commentary Magazine’s&lt;/a&gt; Editor-in-Chief John Podhoretz on the magazine’s Monday podcast. Podhoretz then went on to detail at some length, egged on by Commentary’s Washington columnist and American Enterprise Institute senior fellow Matt Continetti, as to why North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum would be former President Donald Trump’s running mate. They received support for their choice from Commentary Managing Editor Abe Greenwald and Commentary culture and arts commentator and another AEI fellow, Christine Rosen, in a very enjoyable meditation on Burgum-mania.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;You should listen. Actually, you should follow and rate the Commentary podcast with as many stars as are available on your podcast platform of choice because it is simply the best podcast available on a day-in, day-out, Monday-through-Friday basis. My exercise time is usually immediately following the conclusion of my own broadcast, so my sole complaint about the Commentary pod is it sometimes doesn’t post until half-way through my trundling, which obliges me to go farther and longer than I had intended because I won’t not finish a Commentary pod. (I would also like a weekend edition of the pod to listen to, but none of the really excellent pods except occasionally &quot;Call Me Back&quot; hosted by Dan Senor, post on the weekends.) &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Commentary pod really is a model for other magazines and newspapers. Get your four or five very best talents and throw them on a conference call every morning at around 8:30 and push it out fast. The world needs more serious and funny, smart and well-argued podcasts. Here is your model.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/massive-trump-beach-rally-deep-blue-nj-draws-stark-contrast-bidens-beach-weekend-biden-could-never&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MASSIVE TRUMP BEACH RALLY IN DEEP-BLUE NJ DRAWS STARK CONTRAST TO BIDEN&apos;S BEACH WEEKEND: &apos;BIDEN COULD NEVER&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, I am not so quick to declare Burgum as the running mate for the former president. Burgum is indeed impressive on the stump, comforting to &quot;normie&quot; Republicans, and wealthy. He’s also very, very smart. A formidable entry in the Veepstakes yes, and maybe the favorite today, but not a mortal lock. Did I say very smart? I want to repeat that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;If Trump tasked Burgum&lt;/a&gt; with figuring out what to do about AI and social media’s destructive effects on the culture, Burgum would come up with constructive, well-reasoned policies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quick word for four others (and two &quot;not likely but maybe&quot; entrants) in the lists. In alphabetical order of the serious contenders: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton is, like Burgum, razor-sharp smart and knows how to crush left wing media as it comes after Trump or attempts to prop up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Joe Biden.&lt;/a&gt; Cotton displayed that last week on ABC when Jon Karl hosted &quot;This Week&quot; and where Karl dropped any pretense of being a neutral journalist. The pro-Biden apologist pattern continued on this Sunday when Margaret Brennan hosted Cotton on &quot;Face the Nation,&quot; and like Karl a week earlier, Brennan wasn’t going to conduct an interview, but rather debated Cotton on PBiden’s arms embargo on Israel.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cotton dispatched both Brennan and Karl with ease. Harvard trains its lawyers well. Actual combat in Iraq, where Cotton led a platoon during &quot;The Surge,&quot; leaves a senator indifferent to lefty hosts’ attempts to muddle facts and prosecute absurd arguments. Cotton is simply unflappable. This is a skill set Trump values highly: the ability to &quot;do the shows.&quot; Cotton has it, and he’s young, and the &quot;new generation&quot; of leaders argument is a powerful one, not unlike the dynamic that led Ike to tap California Senator Richard Nixon as his running mate in 1952.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nixon had made a mark running the Soviet spy Alger Hiss to ground while in the House, and ran a brass-knuckled campaign to defeat an incumbent Democratic senator Helen Gahagan Douglas in the 1950 California senate campaign. Nixon was a young veteran of World War II, as Cotton is a young veteran of the long wars. The classic role for a VP is to attack, attack, attack. That’s what Ike wanted and got with RN and which Trump may want in his vice president. Cotton knows that battle and has carried it on for a decade inside the Beltway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iowa Senator Joni Ernst is also a warrior — and a woman warrior from the heartland. If the polling shows that a woman on the ticket provides a measurable, enduring advantage, Ernst seems to me to be the best choice open to Trump.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is another veteran and a West Point grad to boot (where, as Trump likes to note, Pompeo ranked first in his class of cadets.). Trump knows exactly what he is getting with the former CIA Director and Kansas Congressman (and another Harvard Law grad.) Trump may want Pompeo at Defense or back at State and Cotton as Attorney General or over at DOD. But the old shoe fits the easiest and Trump worked very well with Pompeo for four years and Pompeo kills &quot;the shows&quot; and partisan media with the same effectiveness as Cotton.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin brings enormous charisma, maybe a shot at carrying light blue Virginia, and a signature issue of huge importance this cycle with his efforts to restore sanity in left-wing public-school districts. Youngkin like Burgum enjoys great wealth. He’s been mentioned a lot by The Great Mentioner too, as has Florida Senator Marco Rubio. I worry that Rubio, unlike Dick Cheney in 2000, lacks a credible claim on any other state residence or that the former president is willing to establish his residency at Bedminster in New Jersey, but we will see. Like Youngkin, Rubio carries with him buckets of charisma to spare.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;So listen to the Commentary gang discuss the impressive North Dakota governor, but keep in mind that there are no &quot;mortal locks&quot; in politics, And there is always the dark horse, very surprising choice. (This year that horse is named Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/h/hugh-hewitt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM HUGH HEWITT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hugh Hewitt is host of &quot;The Hugh Hewitt show,&quot; heard weekday mornings 6am to 9am ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel. Hugh wakes up America on over 400 affiliates nationwide, and on all the streaming platforms where SNC can be seen. He is a frequent guest on the Fox News Channel’s news roundtable hosted by Brett Baier weekdays at 6pm ET. A son of Ohio and a graduate of Harvard College and the University of Michigan Law School, Hewitt has been a Professor of Law at Chapman University’s Fowler School of Law since 1996 where he teaches Constitutional Law.

Hewitt focuses his radio show and his column on the Constitution, national security, American politics and the Cleveland Browns and Guardians. Hewitt has interviewed tens of thousands of guests from Democrats Hillary Clinton and John Kerry to Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump over his 40 years in broadcasting, and this column previews the lead story that will drive his radio/TV show today.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>New polling doesn&amp;apos;t look good for the Biden campaign. A core group of Democrat voters seems to remember the Trump years fondly. Three out of four think Biden&amp;apos;s economy isn&amp;apos;t working.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent polling shows &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Joe Biden losing support&lt;/a&gt; from Black voters; Democrats appear genuinely shocked. Their confusion reflects a reprehensible and dated view of American minorities. New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, recently said at the Milken Institute Conference in California, &quot;we have young Black kids growing up in the Bronx who don’t even know what the word computer is,&quot; a statement so out of touch with reality and so condescending that she had to subsequently apologize.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats are so dug in on the narrative that Blacks in America are condemned by what Biden calls &quot;systemic racism&quot; to poverty and ignorance that they are oblivious to the needs and attitudes of successful middle class African Americans. As it happens, according to Pew research, in 2021, 47% of Blacks were in the middle class, the same as Asians and only slightly less than other ethnic groups.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This group, like all Americans, is concerned about the cost of living and jobs and crime in their neighborhoods. And, like much of the country, they find themselves &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/presidential&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;thinking fondly of the Trump years,&lt;/a&gt; when inflation was less than 2%, unemployment was low, prosecutors were doing their jobs and income inequality, according to the Federal Reserve, was narrowing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6352840418112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIM SCOTT: TRUMP GETTING 20% OF THE BLACK VOTE WOULD &apos;DECIMATE&apos; THE DEMOCRAT PARTY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A devastating new New York Times/Siena poll of critical swing states found 76% of Black voters rate the economy today as &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; while only 22% judged it &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good.&quot; Like other groups, Blacks rank the economy their No. 1 issue.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;opinion writer Charles Blow&lt;/a&gt; noted in a March column that Black business owners are nostalgic for the Trump era; he quotes the owner of a barber shop saying, &quot;I think Mr. Trump did a lot for the business community and ensuring that the entrepreneurs maintain stability to keep our community employed.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echoing those remarks, the New York Times recently published an article detailing the concerns of Black small business owners in Georgia, mostly long-time Democrats, who are considering switching their support to the GOP nominee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They describe the entrepreneurs as frustrated with high interest rates and drawn to former President Donald Trump because of his pro-business bias. As the Times reports, Black Americans are &quot;disproportionately affected by higher interest rates on mortgages, credit cards, student loans and business debts.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Biden and his Democrat colleagues blew out the federal budget early in his presidency, spending $1.9 trillion on the American Rescue Act, and then followed that nakedly political power grab with other hefty spending measures, inflation soared to 9.1% from 1.4% when Biden took office.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve stepped in to control inflation by jacking up interest rates, inflating the cost of buying a home, a car or borrowing to start a business. Even as Biden continues to argue that the economy is doing great and that inflation is coming under control, many – including in the Black community – disagree. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats are terrified that they can no longer count on overwhelming support from the African American community as they gradually move up the income ladder. As Blow wrote recently: &quot;For Democrats, the fear isn’t that Black voters will begin to vote differently from other voters, but that they’ll begin to vote like other voters.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How significant is the shift in support?  That same New York Times poll referenced earlier showed that only 63% of Blacks in six battleground states would pick Biden over Trump in a head-to-head match-up (with 15% saying they didn’t know or refusing to answer), though 87% of those who voted in 2020 went for Biden. Also worrisome for Democrats: only 58% said they considered themselves Democrats, while 30% listed themselves as Independents.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Wall Street Journal poll conducted in April found nearly one third of Black men were considering or were definitely planning to vote for Trump over Biden. Shockingly, some 42% of Black women in that survey are described by pollsters as &quot;up for grabs&quot; in the election.  This is a huge turnaround from 2020 when Biden captured 92% of the Black vote.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a rally held over the past weekend in New Jersey, former Giants football Hall of Famer and lifelong Democrat Lawrence Taylor declared his support for Donald Trump saying, &quot;He will not have to worry, nobody in my family ever voting for a Democrat again.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor is not alone. Republican South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, another Black Trump backer, recently responded to comments from &quot;The View&quot; hosts about Biden’s lock on Black voters saying, &quot;Four out of 10 Black men are wanting to vote for the Republican Party, doubling the number of Black women interested in voting for the Republican Party. What they’re afraid of is the monopoly is over.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the majority of Black voters will almost certainly support Biden in November, there does appear to be some erosion in that &quot;monopoly.&quot; It’s high time. Democrats have taken African Americans for granted for decades. When Biden told radio host Charlamagne tha God in 2020 that Blacks considering voting for Donald Trump &quot;ain’t Black,&quot; it signaled his conviction that Democrats &quot;own&quot; the Black vote. Maybe that is changing. To paraphrase Donald Trump, what do they have to lose? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/p/liz-peek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Progressive LGBTQ student sues Rutgers over &apos;hostile&apos; environment for Jews: &apos;Laboratory of antisemitism&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>The message to Rivka Schafer and other Jewish students was clear at Rutgers according to a new lawsuit: &amp;quot;Don’t support Israel. We know where you sleep.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Jewish student at Rutgers University in New Jersey has been exposed to and damaged by its &quot;laboratory of antisemitism,&quot; according to a lawsuit filed this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivka Schafer is suing Rutgers University, claiming the school failed to protect the safety of Jewish students following a series of antisemitic incidents in recent years, signaling a &quot;toleration of bullying, intimidation, harassment, discrimination, and retaliation against Jewish students [which] denies them their right to an adequate educational environment,&quot; according to a copy of the complaint reviewed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital.&lt;/a&gt; Following Hamas&apos; October 7 terrorist attack on Israel, this &quot;hostility at Rutgers towards Jewish students spiraled out of control.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, an escalating series of incidents led to this conclusion: &quot;The message to Schafer and other Jewish students was clear: ‘Don’t support Israel, we know where you sleep.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schafer, who is an Orthodox Jew, identifies as LGBTQ+ and uses the pronouns &quot;they&quot; and &quot;them,&quot; filed the suit in response to the university&apos;s failure to act in response to the antisemitic incidents Schafer said have taken place on campus since Oct. 7. In the fall of 2023, Schafer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/rutgers-students-stood-up-anti-israel-protests-usa-chant-speak-out-fed-up-with-anti-americanism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;enrolled at Rutgers&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate student and is one of only a few Jewish students living at Demarest Hall, colloquially known as the &quot;gay dorm,&quot; in the 2023- 2024 academic year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While living at Demarest Hall, Schafer was the target of numerous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/universities-cave-anti-israel-agitators-end-occupations-while-some-allow-encampments-continue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;antisemitic events&lt;/a&gt;, according to the lawsuit, which explained that Demarest Hall is &quot;quite different from the traditional on-campus dorm&quot; as most students actively choose to live there, rather than receiving it as part of their housing assignment with the primary purpose of housing students who want to be a part of the tight-knit community for liberal arts. Residents have the option to meet for weekly discussions of relevant topics in the humanities, such as History/Poli Sci, Visual Arts, Cinema Studies, Improv, and Sex, Sexuality, and Gender. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/university-michigan-grad-anti-israel-disruption-commencement-biggest-fear-months&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN GRAD SAYS ANTI-ISRAEL DISRUPTION AT COMMENCEMENT WAS ‘MY BIGGEST FEAR’ FOR MONTHS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These groups foster an engaged and diverse community as well as a noted pride for living in Demarest,&quot; the lawsuit stated. &quot;The students of Demarest also host frequent events, including coffeehouses, art shows, drag shows, band nights, and more.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Demarest Hall also offers inclusive housing options, allowing for co-roommate pairings, and providing gender-neutral bathrooms on the second floor,&quot; the lawsuit added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schafer was reportedly drawn to living in Demarest Hall because of these unique features. As someone who has struggled with feeling accepted, Schafer felt the perceived sense of inclusiveness for all individuals, regardless of their identity, would be a good match, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Schafer didn&apos;t feel as comfortable with that status starting around Oct. 15, when there was a meeting at Demarest Hall with residents, including Schafer, where at least one student expressed appreciation that there was a large death toll in Israel on Oct. 7. Other students showed their approval of this comment by &quot;snapping,&quot; which was the typical manner by which Demarest Hall residents show their agreement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The other students were also extremely aggressive in their commentary about Israel,&quot; the lawsuit said. &quot;As a result of this conduct by her fellow residents, Schafer left the meeting scared and ‘shaking.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jewish-student-defies-anti-israel-radicals-stalked-him-california-campus-wont-be-silenced&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JEWISH STUDENT DEFIES ANTI-ISRAEL RADICALS WHO ‘STALKED’ HIM ON CALIFORNIA CAMPUS: WON&apos;T BE &apos;SILENCED&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, a Mezuzah, which is a Jewish prayer scroll affixed to the doorposts of Jewish person’s homes, was taken from the doorpost of a Jewish student’s dorm room in Demarest Hall. It was later found in the women’s bathroom and interpreted as &quot;a clear act of antisemitism,&quot; according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;After this antisemitic incident occurred, which was reported to Rutgers, Rutgers did not enact any additional safety features to protect Jewish students residing at Demarest Hall, including Schafer,&quot; the lawsuit said. &quot;These incidents gave notice to Rutgers, that Jewish students at Demarest Hall were being targeted.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most recently, Schafer woke up on the morning of March 28, to a poster plastered right outside their room which included a photo of Schafer from two days before at an event where Jewish students showed their support for Israel and the Jewish community, the lawsuit stated. Surrounding the photograph read &quot;Free Palestine,&quot; &quot;Free Gaza,&quot; &amp;amp; &quot;Vote ‘Yes’ to Divest,&quot; in reference to the ongoing BDS referendum vote being held at Rutgers at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Schafer was terrified seeing this poster placed right outside their dorm room, started crying and walked down the hallway only to see the same poster plastered throughout the 2nd floor of Demarest Hall,&quot; the lawsuit stated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schafer&apos;s attorney Cory Rothbort told Fox News Digital there aren&apos;t any safe places left for college-aged American Jews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rutgers holds out Demarest Hall as a place of inclusion for all persons,&quot; he said. &quot;That Rivka was targeted in this dormitory shows that there are no safe spaces on American college campuses for Jews.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in April, faculty members and outside agitators unaffiliated with the school started illegally occupying &quot;encampments&quot; on campus and Schafer was present to personally observe the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/jewish-students-rutgers-speak-latest-anti-israel-incident-campus-horrifying-experience&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;antisemitic and hostile conduct&lt;/a&gt;, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 2, 2024, Schafer and other Jewish students were directly targeted by a female participating in the encampment who is believed to be a Rutgers student. That individual &quot;taunted them and told Schafer and other Jewish students that ‘Hitler would have loved you’&quot; and then &quot;attempted to defend Hamas while equating their actions with the German Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto who fought back against the Nazi regime,&quot; the lawsuit said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schafer has filed a Student Conduct Complaint and Bias Incident Report concerning this incident, but no disciplinary action has been taken against any student or organization for the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rutgers University told Fox News Digital that it does not comment on pending litigation, but pointed to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/chancellor/communications/update-antisemitism-harassment__;!!PxibshUo2Yr_Ta5B!1KLZs6c3fDOxOZb_hdmkX9PwxvRoWpSLkl5TSQcPR2fk2JN37XuKu50NzZUVFy52-tt86nHxdp_lVsdJN6mYQaQ5zmE%24&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWA32f393a1-343b-f9db-ba83-0c608b4b518f&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;university &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/chancellor/communications/update-antisemitism-harassment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWA32f393a1-343b-f9db-ba83-0c608b4b518f&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;message&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/chancellor/communications/update-antisemitism-harassment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;where Rutgers-New Brunswick Chancellor Francine Conway referenced the outcome of an investigation into a related incident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At Rutgers we abhor antisemitism and all forms of intolerance based on religion, national origin, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, ability, or political views,&quot; the statement said. &quot;The university takes seriously every claim of bias, intolerance, and hate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rutgers has policies in place for reporting and investigating bias incidents. When bias incidents are reported, we investigate them fully and take appropriate action, including working with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies when situations warrant to pursue thorough investigations and ensure the safety of Rutgers community members,&quot; the statement concluded. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Zionism explained from its biblical origins to the rebirth of the state of Israel</title>
                    
                    <description>Amid a flurry of antisemitic protests on college campuses, demonstrators have embraced a dangerous school of thought: anti-Zionism. Experts explain its significance to Israel and the Jews.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM – As Israelis mark the rebirth of their nation 76 years after the country’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, declared the modern founding of Israel in 1948, opponents of the Jewish state (anti-Zionists) seek its destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fanatic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/anti-semitism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;anti-Israel activists and antisemites&lt;/a&gt;, particularly on American college campuses, have launched a campaign to strip Jews of their national homeland, the state of Israel, and turn the Mideast’s only democracy into a pariah state, often using anti-Zionist tropes in their chants and on their banners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To many watching today&apos;s protests against Israel, Zionism might have developed a negative connotation, but both biblically and politically, some say it&apos;s a philosophy of action. Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism, famously wrote over 100 years ago about the creation of a new Jewish state&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;If you will it, it is no dream.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital spoke to experts about the mixture of biblical passages and modern philosophy – Zionism – that laid the religious and intellectual foundation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/anti-israel-pro-palestinian-protests-cheapen-concept-genocide-jewish-historian-author&quot;&gt;the re-establishment of Israel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/campus-chaos-anti-israel-rhetoric-reveal-stark-failures-today-higher-education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAMPUS CHAOS AND ANTI-ISRAEL RHETORIC REVEAL STARK FAILURES OF TODAY&apos;S HIGHER EDUCATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herzl, an Austrian-Hungarian Jewish journalist, wrote about the First Zionist Congress, in Switzerland in 1897, &quot;At Basel I founded the Jewish State. If I said this out loud today, I would be answered by universal laughter. Perhaps in five years, and certainly in 50, everyone will know it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herzl’s prescient vision about the Jewish state became a concrete reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ze&apos;ev Orenstein, the director of international affairs for the City of David Foundation in Jerusalem, explained its spiritual and religious importance. &quot;Zionism not only represents the return of the Jewish people as sovereign to their ancestral homeland – the Land of Israel – where we have had a continuous presence dating back some 3,500 years to the time of the Biblical Joshua until today.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/survivor-hamas-terror-attack-israel-recounts-pain-grief-losing-angel-boyfriend-oct-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SURVIVOR OF HAMAS TERROR ATTACK ON ISRAEL RECOUNTS PAIN, GRIEF OF LOSING ‘ANGEL’ BOYFRIEND ON OCT. 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A land where the Jewish people are worshiping the same God, practicing the same faith, walking upon the very same hills and valleys, speaking the same language and keeping the same traditions and festivals as our ancestors did millennia ago,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orenstein cited a biblical passage from Amos 9: 14-15 that grounds the creation of the Jewish state in the Holy land: &quot;I will restore My people Israel from captivity; they will rebuild and inhabit the ruined cities. They will plant vineyards and drink their wine; they will make gardens and eat their fruit. I will firmly plant them in their own land, never again to be uprooted from the land that I have given them, says the Lord your God.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orenstein noted the transition from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/bible-featuring-americas-constitution-passion-project-lee-greenwood-faith-country-star&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Bible&lt;/a&gt; to the modern solidification of Israel as a state &quot;also represents the return of the Jewish people to being masters of our own fate and destiny – only fully possible as sovereign in our homeland – striving to build a society which will serve as a source of light, inspiration and blessing – not only to Israel and the Jewish people, but to all the peoples of the region and to the entire world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/mother-american-israeli-hostage-oct-7-faith-dark-depths-pain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOTHER OF AMERICAN-ISRAELI HOSTAGE TAKEN ON OCT. 7 SAYS HER FAITH HELPS HER THROUGH HER DARKEST DEPTHS OF PAIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, &quot;The return of the Jewish people to Israel as sovereign after 2,000 years of exile, serves as an eternal reminder to individuals and nations alike that what was need not be. Despite seemingly insurmountable odds, and with equal measures of unwavering determination and unbreakable faith, good will ultimately triumph.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-Zionists continue to denigrate both Herzl’s founding philosophy of the modern Jewish state, Zionism, and the Biblical foundation of the state of Israel. The U.N. also played a key role in stoking antisemitism and anti-Israel hatred, argue its critics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1975, a majority of U.N. member states, spearheaded by the Soviets and Arab dictatorships, passed a resolution equating Zionism with racism. After the collapse of the communist Soviet Union and its allies in Eastern Europe, member states &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-accused-blood-libel-against-israel-latest-long-history-bias-against-jewish-state&quot;&gt;overturned the antisemitic resolution in 1991&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eugene Kontorovich, an Israeli legal scholar, told Fox News Digital, &quot;Opposition to Zionism means that Jews, having achieved national independence, are not entitled to keep it. There is no similar global opposition to any other people’s statehood, which makes it hard to separate ‘anti-Zionism’ from the millennia of antisemitism that faced Jews before they had a state. Indeed, with the plurality of the world’s Jews living in Israel and almost all of the rest strongly attached to it, ‘anti-Zionism’ is a transparent rebranding of antisemitism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/death-to-america-rapidly-emerging-key-slogan-anti-israel-agitators-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&apos;DEATH TO AMERICA&apos; RAPIDLY EMERGING AS KEY SLOGAN OF ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS IN US&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kontorovich noted, &lt;i&gt;&quot;&lt;/i&gt;Zionism is the national independence movement of the Jewish people. For 2,000 cruel years, the Jewish people did not have a home, and was at the mercy of the nations and empires they found themselves in – a minority everywhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, &quot;Supporting Zionism means that just as the Irish have Ireland, the Ukrainians have Ukraine, and Japanese have Japan, Jews should have an independent state in their ancestral homeland. Many ethnic groups are majorities in numerous states, like Arabs, which have over 20 countries that identify themselves as Arab. Zionism does not insist that Jews, have two states – say one for Azshkenazi Jews, and one for Sephardim. Just one. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azshkenazi Jews have their modern roots in Eastern and Central Europe, while Sephardic Jews have their origins in Portugal and Spain and later fled to North Africa and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many Jews, the yearning of a return to their Biblical homeland is also captured by the famous Psalm 126:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A song of ascents. When the Lord restored the captives of Zion, we were like dreamers. Then our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with shouts of joy. Then it was said among the nations, The Lord has done great things for them. The Lord has done great things for us and we are filled with joy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
