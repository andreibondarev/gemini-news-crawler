                    <title>Excused juror reveals selection process for Trump&apos;s hush money trial: &apos;Not a fan&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>An excused juror in former President Donald Trump&amp;apos;s hush money trial spoke to Fox News Tuesday about the selection process after she was dismissed.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A potential juror in former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Donald Trump&apos;s hush money&lt;/a&gt; trial in New York City spoke to the media shortly after she was excused from the pool, highlighting the &quot;serious&quot; mood inside the courtroom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Definitely serious,&quot; former potential juror Kara McGee, who works in cybersecurity, said on Tuesday. &quot;…Everyone was really taking it upon themselves to step in and do civic duty here, regardless of what people came into it thinking about the defendant.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGee said that she told the court she could serve as juror in an unbiased manner, while noting in her comment to the media it would be &quot;very difficult for anyone really in this country to not come to this without prior opinions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We all have prior opinions on the defendant, unless you&apos;ve been living in a cardbox,&quot; she said. McGee said she was excused from the jury pool due to scheduling conflicts with her employment in cybersecurity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m not a fan,&quot; McGee added of her personal thoughts on Trump. &quot;During COVID-19, I lived with someone who was immunocompromised, and I think his handling of COVID-19 was abysmal,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/april-16-trump-hush-money-trial-enters-day-two-jury&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIVE UPDATES: TRUMP HUSH MONEY TRIAL ENTERS DAY TWO AS JURY SELECTION CONTINUES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial kicked off Monday with a pool of 96 jurors, before roughly 50 were excused on the first day for saying they could not be impartial in the case. An additional nine were removed Monday for other reasons. Of that pool, an estimated 35 candidates remained on Tuesday morning, with 14 of those excused by early Tuesday afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-kicks-off-day-two-hush-money-trial-directing-ire-conflicted-judge-trump-hating&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP KICKS OFF DAY TWO OF HUSH MONEY TRIAL DIRECTING IRE AT &apos;CONFLICTED&apos; JUDGE: &apos;TRUMP-HATING&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGee said two of the questions asked of potential jurors most clearly indicated how they felt about Trump and the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;One of which is: Do you have opinions about the ability for a former sitting president to be tried in a court of law? Which I think the way people answered that showed how they felt about case,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-presiding-over-trump-hush-money-case-declines-recuse-himself&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;JUDGE PRESIDING OVER TRUMP HUSH MONEY CASE DECLINES TO RECUSE HIMSELF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The other one was: Do you have any opinions about legal limits for campaign finance donation amounts? Which I believe was another one that was kinda meant to gauge feelings about the particular case,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGee said she did make eye contact with Trump as she was excused from the trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I looked at him after I had finished giving final answer … I glanced over at him again, and made eye contact with him, and have no idea what he thought at that moment,&quot; she said of her interaction with Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday is the second day of trial in the hush money case, which marks the first time a former president has stood trial on criminal charges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced last year that Trump was charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records. The charges stem from the 2016 election cycle, when former Trump attorney Michael Cohen paid former pornographic actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 to allegedly silence her claims she had an extramarital affair with Trump back in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-calls-hush-money-trial-assault-america-case-officially-kicks-off&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP CALLS HUSH MONEY TRIAL &apos;ASSAULT ON AMERICA&apos; AS CASE OFFICIALLY KICKS OFF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors say the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen for the payment to Daniels and falsely recorded the payments as legal expenses. Prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified the records with an intent to commit or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conceal a second crime, which is a felony.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has repeatedly denied the affair and pleaded not guilty to the charges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump spoke to the media earlier Tuesday morning, ahead of entering the courtroom, where he railed against presiding Judge Juan Merchan as a &quot;conflicted&quot; judge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trial-jury-selection-resume-possible-jurors-excused-saying-they-could-not-be-impartial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP TRIAL: JURY SELECTION TO RESUME AFTER POSSIBLE JURORS EXCUSED FOR SAYING THEY COULD NOT BE IMPARTIAL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trump-hating judge&lt;/a&gt;. We have a judge who shouldn&apos;t be on this case. He&apos;s totally conflicted. But this is a trial that should never happen. It should have been thrown out a long time ago,&quot; Trump said Tuesday morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s a trial that is being looked upon and looked at all over the world. … They&apos;re looking at, analyzing it. Every legal pundit, every legal scholar said this trial is a disgrace,&quot; he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial is anticipated to last at least six weeks, with jury selection expected to last at least a week. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Circus performer follows in parents&apos; footsteps as human cannonball, feeling 7 G&apos;s with each launch</title>
                    
                    <description>Skyler Miser has grown up around the circus. Now as the Ringling Rocket, she knows circus life well, as both of her parents are also former performers.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The circus is full of compelling acts, dangerous stunts and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/arts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;entertaining performers&lt;/a&gt;. One performer who is part of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp;amp; Bailey is Skyler Miser, who stars as the Ringling Rocket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the show, in some cases three times a day, Miser acts as a human cannonball — she&apos;s blasted through the air out of a rocket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though this is Miser’s first time performing as the Ringling Rocket, she&apos;s no stranger to circus life. She was born into it, she told Fox News Digital during a stop in Worcester, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/my-world-has-changed-forever-ohio-girls-big-success-big-apple-radio-city-rockette&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&apos;MY WORLD HAS CHANGED FOREVER&apos;: OHIO GIRL&apos;S BIG SUCCESS IN BIG APPLE AS A RADIO CITY ROCKETTE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/parenting/family&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;parents, Brian and Tina Miser,&lt;/a&gt; performed as human cannonballs before her, making her upbringing extremely unique. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Growing up in the circus has been the best experience. There&apos;s not a lot of people that can say that they grew up in the circus, but I did,&quot; Skyler Miser said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s not an experience that everybody gets to experience. I don&apos;t know anything more. It&apos;s been my life since I was born — Ringling has been my life since I was born. So to actually be here and to be performing is really incredible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though a childhood spent traveling with her performing parents in their motor home was less than ordinary, there was still some normalcy in her day-to-day schedule, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We had a nursery. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;We had a school there,&lt;/a&gt; so I did grow up on the show learning regular school stuff, playing with other children. But of course, they didn&apos;t think that our lifestyle was weird, either,&quot; Miser said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not long before Miser started to perform herself. Her first professional performance came at age 13, but her very first time on stage came far earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My first professional performance, I did the aerial silks. My dad was working, and he was doing the rocket on another show, and he thought it would be fun for me to come and join them, so that was my first professional experience,&quot; Miser said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My first time ever actually being out on stage was on Ringling. I was 2. My parents did an act in the pre-show for about five minutes. So my dad would do a high fall and my mom would give a little speech about the cannon and that act.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Miser does not remember the details from her first, smaller scale launch that she completed at 11 years old when the family &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/indiana&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;was based in Indiana&lt;/a&gt; — one thing she will never forget is the feeling she got flying through the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/why-do-we-say-break-leg-popular-expressions-fun-origin-stories&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY DO WE SAY ‘BREAK A LEG’ AND OTHER POPULAR EXPRESSIONS? HERE ARE 3 FUN ORIGIN STORIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My very first time I was 11 years old, so I don&apos;t really remember much from then. It was February and it was freezing cold outside. So my dad had made an eight-foot-long cannon for a clown act in England,&quot; said Miser. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Before he sent it over, he asked if I wanted to be the ‘test dummy.’ So, of course, I said yes. I only went about 18 feet, but I remember that thrill and that big adrenaline rush I got even from that 18 feet … When I started going farther when I was 18, I didn&apos;t realize that that very first shot I did was very baby compared to what I&apos;m about to do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it feel like to fly through the air at the speed Miser does with each show? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She described the feeling as &quot;a mini car crash.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think the rocket is more mentally challenging than physically. Obviously, it takes a physical toll on you, because you&apos;re going at 7 G&apos;s,&quot; Miser said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I like to think of it as like a mini car crash every show. You have to make sure that you&apos;re really warmed up and your body&apos;s well-prepared,&quot; she told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Otherwise, you can get hurt. We do lots of checks before the show. So I&apos;m going and I&apos;m checking things every 30 minutes, just because if you don&apos;t check something, you might forget something. So it&apos;s just a lot of mental preparation, a lot of stretching.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the days Miser is not being launched through the air for her daring circus act — landing on what looks like a giant inflated pillow — she enjoys exploring whatever city she is in and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;trying some of the local cuisine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The typical day off is interesting. Normally, I like to sleep and just kind of recover from the week that we just had ... Depends on the city. I like to go out and find historical things to do. I&apos;m a big foodie ...so finding fun restaurants,&quot; Miser said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who has grown up around the circus for her entire life, Miser has been able to see the way it has evolved and changed over the years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve seen the show change completely. Even from when I was a kid to before when they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/ringling-bros-and-barnum-bailey-circus-drop-curtain-on-greatest-show-on-earth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;closed in 2017,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Miser said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It took a switch, but I think that&apos;s what you have to do in order to keep up with the current times of the entertainment industry.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — It&apos;s a moment in history — the first U.S. president facing criminal charges in an American courtroom. Yet only a handful of observers are able to see or even hear what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, most of the nation is getting news of former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/five-most-dramatic-moments-first-day-trumps-hush-money-trial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Donald Trump&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; hush money trial secondhand. Starting with preliminary motions and jury selection Monday, reporters in a Manhattan courtroom must convey what is being said to the outside world after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trial-jury-selection-resume-possible-jurors-excused-saying-they-could-not-be-impartial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP TRIAL: JURY SELECTION TO RESUME AFTER POSSIBLE JURORS EXCUSED FOR SAYING THEY COULD NOT BE IMPARTIAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s all because New York state law regarding media coverage of court proceedings is one of the most restrictive in the country. Last week&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/oj-simpson-new-york-times-oj-simpson-sparks-outcry-saying-world-ruined-murder-trial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;death of O.J. Simpson&lt;/a&gt;, whose murder trial beamed live from a California courtroom captivated a nation three decades ago, was a telling reminder of how New York is behind the times — or, at least, a holdout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHY WON&apos;T NEW YORK LET ME SEE IT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulations limiting media coverage in courtrooms date back nearly a century, when the spectacle of bright flashbulbs and camera operators standing on witness tables during the 1935 trial of the man accused of kidnapping and killing Charles Lindbergh&apos;s baby son horrified the legal community, according to a 2022 report by the New York-based Fund for Modern Courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rules to enforce decorum spread nationally, amended to account for the invention of television, as defense lawyers worried that video coverage would harm their cases, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet an interest in open government chipped away at these laws and — slowly, carefully — video cameras began to be permitted in courts across the country, often at the discretion of judges presiding in individual cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York allowed them, too, on an experimental basis between 1987 and 1997, but they were shut down. Lobbyists for defense lawyers remain strong in New York and hold particular sway among lawyers in the state Assembly, said Victor Kovner, a former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/law-enforcement-officers-killed-gunfire-ambush-identified-new-york-officials&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; corporation counsel who advocates for open courtrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York and Louisiana are the only states remaining that completely restrict video coverage, the Fund for Modern Courts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Kovner and others, that&apos;s outrageous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re the media capital of the world, we like to think, and the fact that cameras aren&apos;t permitted in one of our three branches of government is unacceptable,&quot; said New York State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who has sponsored a bill to try to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s one of the most consequential trials of our modern age,&quot; the senator said. &quot;I think the public has a right to see exactly what happens in that courtroom.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the trial&apos;s first day, some reporters suggested that it appeared there were times that Trump drifted off to sleep while watching the proceedings. The former president&apos;s campaign disputed that. With no video camera in place and trained on him, there&apos;s no way of knowing for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WAIT — I SAW A PICTURE OF TRUMP IN COURT AT THE TRIAL&apos;S START&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s because the presiding judge, Juan M. Merchan, permitted a handful of still photographers to shoot photos of Trump before the day&apos;s proceedings started. Once court was called into session, courtroom sketch artists — a dying communications form — hold sway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is actually some video coverage of the trial, available on monitors in an overflow room adjacent to the main courtroom. It was packed Monday with reporters, court officers and a few members of the public, including Ron Sinibaldi, a former accountant from Long Island who lined up outside the courthouse before midnight for a seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I read presidential biographies,&quot; Sinibaldi said. &quot;I go to presidential libraries. I&apos;m here for the history.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW CAN THOSE INVOLVED GET AROUND THE RESTRICTIONS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a hallway outside of the courtroom, a limited number of cameras and a small pool of reporters are positioned to capture remarks of anyone involved in the trial who want to address the outside world. That included Trump, even before the proceedings started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absent live coverage of the trial, how often the former president chooses to take advantage of those cameras and whether news organizations carry his remarks either live, taped or not at all will play a big role in how the case is perceived publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSNBC carried his remarks live on Monday morning. &quot;They&apos;re trying to grab the narrative regardless of the outcome,&quot; CNN reporter Phil Mattingly said of the Trump defense team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW ARE JOURNALISTS COVERING THE TRIAL HANDLING IT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With some difficulty. CNN stationed a team on the streets of Manhattan outside the courtroom, where a truck festooned with pro-Trump flags frequently drove by, blaring horns and music from loudspeakers. Reporters sometimes struggled to be heard. &quot;It is kind of a circus down here,&quot; CNN&apos;s Kaitlan Collins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commentators and experts, many of them with experience in jury selection, offered opinions from outside the courtroom or from studios. Fox News analyst Jonathan Turley said &quot;most cities, at least those outside of New York,&quot; will see the case as a weaponization of criminal justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With estimates that jury selection could take two weeks, and no way of showing it, journalists will have a lot of time to fill unless they turn their attention elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WILL OTHER TRUMP CASES BE TELEVISED?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgia, where Trump faces charges of election meddling, gives judges discretion over whether to allow television cameras. Superior Court of Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee has said he will make all hearings and trials in that case available for broadcast. That has already included hearings on whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis would be allowed to argue the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal courts do not allow cameras in criminal cases. Trump is facing separate federal cases for election interference and mishandling classified documents, although it is not clear when, or if, trials will take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feds offer one glimmer of hope: The U.S. Supreme Court permits audio of oral arguments to be broadcast outside of the courtroom. But there&apos;s no indication that this would apply to Trump&apos;s case. New York&apos;s law does not allow audio coverage of his hush money trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proponents of legislation to open up New York courts to electronic media coverage are hoping the attention paid to the Trump case may boost their proposals. The idea is being considered as part of current negotiations over the New York state budget so, theoretically, a new law could even affect the Trump trial if it is passed and goes into effect immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given New York state&apos;s history, it&apos;s best not to count on it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>The lawyer for Lee Chatfield, the former leader of the Michigan House, said Tuesday that prosecutors plan to file charges against Chatfield for financial crimes.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Prosecutors plan to file charges of financial crimes against the former leader of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michigan-gop-lawmakers-slam-taxpayer-funded-rent-subsidies-migrants-pending-asylum-applications&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; House, his lawyer said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-michigan-ag-calls-tlaib-cruel-hateful-israel-comments&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Attorney General Dana Nessel&lt;/a&gt; said she would speak to reporters in the state capital at 2 p.m. EDT. Her office disclosed no other details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/swing-states-dem-governor-condemns-death-to-america-chants-her-state-more-than-week-after-protest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SWING STATE&apos;S DEM GOVERNOR CONDEMNS &apos;DEATH TO AMERICA&apos; CHANTS IN HER STATE MORE THAN A WEEK AFTER PROTEST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ex-michigan-house-speaker-aides-plead-not-guilty-embezzlement-nonprofit-funds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Lee Chatfield&lt;/a&gt;, a Republican who is no longer a state lawmaker, was House speaker in 2019 and 2020 when the GOP controlled the chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;ve learned that the charges are financial in nature,&quot; Chatfield&apos;s attorney, Mary Chartier, told The Associated Press. &quot;We&apos;re prepared to fight them each and every step of the way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It took almost 2 1/2 years for the AG&apos;s office to come up with charges. It&apos;s going to be pretty flimsy if it took that long,&quot; Chartier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chatfield has been under investigation since his sister-in-law said he sexually assaulted her. He has denied the allegations and said they had a consensual affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;ve learned there is no CSC charge or something like that,&quot; Chartier told AP, referring to criminal sexual conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people who were top aides to Chatfield when he ran the House were charged last year with crimes, including embezzlement from nonprofit funds created for political purposes. Rob and Anne Minard have pleaded not guilty.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Scott Peterson, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/true-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;convicted wife killer&lt;/a&gt; who has maintained his innocence since before his arrest in 2004, returned to court Tuesday to withdraw a motion to seal a document in the case after prosecutors told the court most of the information is already public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A California jury found Peterson guilty in 2004 of the murders of his pregnant wife, Laci, and their unborn son, Conner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At issue were the identities of some witnesses whose names have already come out in the nearly 20 years since Peterson&apos;s conviction. However, other witnesses&apos; identities have not even been divulged to prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 20-minute hearing was largely uneventful ahead of another one next month expected to delve into DNA evidence that the defense believes could clear Peterson&apos;s name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/scott-peterson-killer-pregnant-wife-sports-new-look-court-latest-bid-freedom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCOTT PETERSON, KILLER OF PREGNANT WIFE, SPORTS NEW LOOK IN COURT IN LATEST BID FOR FREEDOM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 51-year-old appeared remotely from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ione, California&apos;s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Mule Creek State Prison wearing a blue collared shirt. He only spoke in response to the judge when she asked if he could hear her and when asked if he consented to appearing remotely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is seeking a new trial with help from the Los Angeles Innocence Project, which picked up his case in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key evidence against Scott Peterson:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/story/timeline-the-laci-peterson-case&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TIMELINE: THE LACI PETERSON CASE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A California court initially sentenced Peterson to death for the murders, and while the sentence was later overturned, his appeal for a new trial failed in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/scott-peterson-case-taken-los-angeles-innocence-project-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Los Angeles Innocence Project&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are seeking new DNA testing on a hammer linked to a burglary across the street from the Peterson family home as well as a stained mattress found in a burned-out van parked less than a mile away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peterson and his supporters have long focused on suspects who allegedly burglarized the Medina family house across the street from his home, alleging they could have killed his wife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Peterson has previously raised issues of juror misconduct and the potential that the burglars could have abducted and killed his wife, the new appeal hinges on conducting new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/natural-science/genetics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA testing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the mattress with present-day technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional hearings on DNA evidence and discovery have been scheduled for May 29 and July 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His stint in state prison began in March 2005.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-sues-beach-city-voter-id-law-backed-majority-residents&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; might step in to regulate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/groundwater-reservoir-levels-remain-at-historic-lows-but-rainwater-and-flooding-should-help&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;groundwater&lt;/a&gt; use in part of the crop-rich San Joaquin Valley, which would be a first-of-its-kind move that comes a decade after lawmakers tasked local communities with carefully managing the precious but often overused resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At issue is control over a farming-dependent area where state officials say local water agencies haven’t come up with a strong enough plan to keep the water flowing sustainably into the future. The State Water Resources Control Board will hold a hearing Tuesday to decide whether to place the region under monitoring, which would mean state, not local, officials would temporarily watch over and limit how much water could be pumped from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-considers-adding-treated-wastewater-drinking-supply-new-proposal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CALIFORNIA CONSIDERS ADDING TREATED WASTEWATER TO DRINKING SUPPLY THROUGH NEW PROPOSAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s a huge deal,&quot; said Dusty Ference, executive director of the Kings County Farm Bureau, which represents regional farmers. &quot;What you gain in having local control is the ability to build groundwater recharge projects and some flexibility with how water is used and moved and traded or not.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ference said the state board wouldn’t have the local expertise or staff to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It will just be, ‘Here’s the pumping amount we authorize. Do with it what you can.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hearing is seen as a test of how California’s groundwater rules are working 10 years after lawmakers passed them. The limits came after years of overpumping and drought led to a host of problems ranging from residential wells running dry to sinking land. The goal was to make the most critically overdrafted groundwater basins sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities have since formed groundwater sustainability agencies and drafted management plans. In the Tulare Lake Subbasin, five local agencies worked on a single proposal, only to see it rejected last year by the state Department of Water Resources over concerns about lowering groundwater levels, sinking land and degrading groundwater quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the state water board steps in after Tuesday’s hearing, officials could require anyone who extracts more than a minimal amount of groundwater to report how much they take and pay fees for it. The state could also require larger pumpers to install and use meters that measure water use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tulare Lake Subbasin covers a stretch of Kings County, which is home to about 150,000 people halfway between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/los-angeles-hot-water-spending-hundreds-millions-worsening-homeless-crisis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; and San Francisco. The county is a major producer of milk, pistachios, cotton and processed tomatoes, according to a county agricultural report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also home to Tulare Lake, a large, dry basin that fills with water in rainy years. The lake most recently reappeared in 2023 after intense winter downpours that flooded farms and roads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doug Freitas, an almond grower who owns property in areas governed by three different groundwater agencies, said each agency has been talking about what to do next. He said he knew about the state’s groundwater law, but like most small farmers, he was so busy trying to make ends meet that he couldn’t foresee the impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a farmer, my opinion is we need more time,&quot; Freitas said. &quot;I would like to go to that meeting and beg for mercy and ask for them to let us come back to the table.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the agencies, the Mid-Kings River Groundwater Sustainability Agency, proposed an April 23 vote on charging landowners fees and limiting pumping. The move has met with some resistance, and agency director Dennis Mills recently told residents something must be done if they want to try to keep the state from stepping in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They will not accept more promises at this point,&quot; Mills said. &quot;Just a revised plan is not good enough. They need to see concrete steps as to how we’re addressing these things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there are people like Joaquin Contente, a longtime dairy farmer in Kings County, who said pumping fees and caps spell trouble for him, whether they are imposed by local or state officials. He relies on groundwater to grow the alfalfa he feeds his 800 cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know there’s a lot of people losing sleep over it, because I am one of them,&quot; Contente said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ference, the farm bureau director, said he supports local control so that farmers can have a say in what happens and communities can invest in local recharge projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a community, countywide issue that, if it’s not managed properly, will be catastrophic,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>House delivers Mayorkas impeachment articles to Schumer, setting up trial proceedings</title>
                    
                    <description>The long-awaited articles of impeachment against DHS Secretary Mayorkas were delivered to the Senate on Tuesday, setting in motion a required procedure in the upper chamber.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;House impeachment managers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-mayorkas-impeachment-articles-gop-dismissal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;officially delivered two articles&lt;/a&gt; of impeachment passed against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., shortly after 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After delaying the planned delivery last week and pushing it to Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., directed impeachment managers to bring the long-anticipated articles to the Senate, which will set off a number of procedural actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-dems-reveal-massive-79-million-ad-spend-protect-majority-ahead-key-match-ups&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SENATE DEMS REVEAL MASSIVE $79M AD SPEND TO PROTECT MAJORITY AHEAD OF KEY MATCH UPS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The articles were initially passed in February, but the House held off sending them to the Senate until after the appropriations process was over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With custody of the articles, Schumer has urged all senators to be present during the week as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-mayorkas-impeachment-articles-gop-dismissal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;they will be sworn in&lt;/a&gt; as jurors for the impeachment trial on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-tuberville-quarterly-abortion-reports-veterans-affairs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALABAMA SENATOR SEEKS TO EXPOSE ABORTIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once sworn in, it&apos;s unclear whether a trial will proceed. Republicans in the Senate have accused their Democratic counterparts of wanting to dismiss the trial, using a motion to table, effectively killing it. And while some Democrats, such as Sen. Tammy Baldwin, Wis., said they haven&apos;t heard about plans for their caucus to do this, others have pushed for it. Sens. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who are both up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-dems-reveal-massive-79-million-ad-spend-protect-majority-ahead-key-match-ups?intcmp=tw_fnc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;competitive re-election races&lt;/a&gt;, as is Baldwin, revealed they want to dismiss the impeachment trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-ukraine-loan-dems-gop-aid-package&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP&apos;S LOAN PROPOSAL FOR UKRAINE AID MAY BE COMMON GROUND FOR COMPREHENSIVE FOREIGN AID PACKAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Democratic senators prepping for tough re-election battles in November have been considered the factors that will decide whether the trial moves forward. Sens. Bob Casey, D-Penn., Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Baldwin still haven&apos;t revealed their plans. Each vote will be critical, as the Senate is divided narrowly 51 to 49, Democrats to Republicans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schumer has not indicated whether Democrats will seek a procedural off-ramp for the trial, as some caucus members have said they would like to see. However, the majority leader said in a recent statement, &quot;We want to address this issue as expeditiously as possible,&quot; regarding the articles of impeachment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As I’ve said repeatedly, impeachment should never be used to settle a policy disagreement,&quot; Schumer also claimed. &quot;That would set a horrible precedent for the Congress.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) has advised all Republican competitors in key states with vulnerable Democratic incumbents to pressure their opponents in the impeachment trial. If those candidates seeking re-election look to dismiss the trial, Republicans are expected to hold it against them during the campaign. This could be particularly persuasive as the southern border has become an increasingly important issue for voters across the country. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Belgian police shut down a far right conference as it rallies ahead of Europe&apos;s June elections</title>
                    
                    <description>An annual gathering of far-right politicians and supporters, held this year in Brussels, was shut down by Belgian police on Tuesday who cited concerns about public order.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (AP) — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/belgium-disband-military-platoon-serious-violence-harassment-defense-minister-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; police shut down a gathering of far-right politicians and supporters on Tuesday, citing concerns about public order, while attendees protested curbs on free speech and vowed to find another venue for Day 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual National Conservative conference, held this year in Brussels, comes ahead of Europe-wide elections. As campaigning for the June 6-9 event heats up, mainstream parties fear that disenchanted voters might turn to the people at NatCon 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/belgian-police-arrest-adult-3-minors-plot-attack-concert-hall&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BELGIAN POLICE ARREST ADULT, 3 MINORS IN PLOT TO ATTACK CONCERT HALL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is what we’re up against. We’re up against a new form of evil ideology,&quot; Nigel Farage, the man credited with taking Britain out of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/eu-lawmakers-approve-overhaul-migration-law-hoping-deprive-far-right-votes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, told the gathering of a few hundred stridently nationalist and fundamentalist Christian politicians and think-tankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-migrant sentiment featured in a number of speeches. Some targeted what they saw as the follies of climate policy, &quot;narco-socialism&quot; or &quot;woke indoctrination,&quot; often with sharp opposition to multinational organizations like the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lashing out at the bloc’s treaties, and the pledge in the preamble of the founding EU texts to an &quot;ever-closer Union&quot; among the 27 member countries, Polish lawmaker Ryszard Legutko said it all makes &quot;medieval monks look almost like intellectual anarchists.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys suggest that mainstream political parties are likely to retain power after the June elections, but quite possibly with a reduced majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belgian police quietly shut down the conference by barring attendees from re-entering the venue if they dared to leave. A dozen or so officers blocked the main entrance. It was the third venue for the gathering after the owners of two other locations shied away when anti-fascist protesters vowed to disrupt proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s NatCon, organized by the conservative U.S. think tank the Edmund Burke Foundation, was held under the banner of &quot;National Conservatism, Preserving the Nation-State in Europe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French far-right figurehead Eric Zemmour was scheduled to criticize the EU’s new migrant and asylum rules but was turned away by police. Suella Braverman, who served as U.K. home secretary for just over a month in 2022 before being fired, railed for 27 minutes against the European Court of Human Rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians and former leaders from Spain, Poland and the Netherlands were also on the agenda. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/hungary-pm-orban-blasts-western-world-calls-trump-victory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban&lt;/a&gt; was due to speak on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I guess they couldn’t take free speech any longer,&quot; Orban posted on the social media platform X. &quot;The last time they wanted to silence me with the police was when the Communists set them on me in ’88. We didn’t give up then and we will not give up this time either!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speakers summoned the grand ideas of figures like the Pope, Homer, Dostoyevsky, Leo Strauss, Tocqueville and Gramsci. English was the common language, spattered with classical Latin. Modern liberal democracy was likened to a form of &quot;neo-Marxist authoritarianism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mostly though, those who could speak before the gathering was shut down for the day focused on their &quot;enemies&quot; among the mainstream political parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have to know our enemies are in panic and they show it every day,&quot; said EU lawmaker Hermann Tertsch, from Spain’s far-right Vox party. &quot;The enemy knows their time is running out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Brussels police warned that the conference&apos;s time was limited, too, Edmund Burke Foundation Chairman Yoram Hazony invited participants to stay as long as they dared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The new democracy works in mysterious ways. Your goal as someone in the new democracy is to prevent the other guy from speaking,&quot; Hazony said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Chris Smith has introduced legislation that would ensure &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-finalizes-crackdown-gas-cars-forcing-more-than-50-of-car-sales-to-be-electric&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;minerals key to green energy&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. are not extracted using child labor in the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith&apos;s legislation — called the Stop China’s Exploitation of Congolese Children and Adult Forced Labor through Cobalt Mining Act — would specifically block cobalt extracted or processed with the use of child or forced labor from entering the U.S. market. Cobalt is a vital component of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, but is largely sourced from the DRC where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cecc.gov/events/hearings/from-cobalt-to-cars-how-china-exploits-child-and-forced-labor-in-the-congo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;human rights investigations&lt;/a&gt; have found child labor is rampant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Chinese companies often own cobalt mines in the DRC that export raw materials to China to be processed. The vast majority of worldwide cobalt is processed in Chinese facilities, according to the International Energy Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Communist Chinese government — which has gained almost full dominance of every single step of the cobalt supply chain — profits from child and forced labor used to extract cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo and power our so-called ‘green economy,’&quot; said Smith, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Global Human Rights Subcommittee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/study-casts-doubt-electric-vehicles-climate-cost-benefits-wont-achieve-goals-intended&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;STUDY CASTS DOUBT ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES&apos; CLIMATE, COST BENEFITS: &apos;WON&apos;T ACHIEVE THE GOALS INTENDED&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith&apos;s legislation was crafted alongside House Ways and Means Committee &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/jason-smith&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chairman Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo.,&lt;/a&gt; whose committee has jurisdiction over the bill. The committee will mark the legislation up on Wednesday, setting it up for a potential floor vote in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill was also written, in part, in response to a November congressional hearing chaired by Rep. Chris Smith that put a spotlight on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/researchers-reveal-ev-industry-can-still-linked-child-labor-fueled-mines&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;forced labor in the DRC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-nominee-wants-hijack-little-known-agency-ram-through-climate-agenda&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN NOMINEE WANTS TO HIJACK LITTLE-KNOWN AGENCY TO RAM THROUGH CLIMATE AGENDA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;America has long fought to end child and adult forced labor, yet the cobalt vital to the batteries in our technology is unethically mined with the use of forced labor under Chinese control,&quot; Rep. Jason Smith said. &quot;This legislation is a critical step to blocking material tainted by these inhumane labor practices from entering this country. I am thankful to Rep. Chris Smith for introducing this legislation to stop these dangerous practices.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, in 2023, the DRC produced 74% of the world&apos;s cobalt and is home to more than half of known global reserves of the mineral, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-cobalt.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S., on the other hand, mined less than 1% of the world&apos;s cobalt supply and contains less than 1% of its reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it remains unclear exactly how many of the mines are artisanal and employ child laborers, a USGS National Minerals Information Center study published in June determined that up to 11% of cobalt produced in the nation is tied to child labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Labor&apos;s Bureau of International Labor Affairs previously found that more than 40,000 children, including children as young as 6 years old, work in cobalt mines in the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stop China’s Exploitation of Congolese Children and Adult Forced Labor through Cobalt Mining Act comes as the Biden administration continues to push for a rapid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-cracks-down-on-diesel-trucks-in-bid-to-fight-climate-change-reduce-emissions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;economy-wide transition to electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. In recent weeks, the administration has finalized rules pushing for more than 50% of car sales to be electric by 2030 and a large share of trucks to be zero-emissions in that same timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Three years ago, I set an ambitious target: that half of all new cars and trucks sold in 2030 would be zero-emission,&quot; President Biden said last month. &quot;I brought together American automakers. I brought together American autoworkers. Together, we’ve made historic progress. Hundreds of new expanded factories across the country. Hundreds of billions in private investment and thousands of good-paying union jobs. And we’ll meet my goal for 2030 and race forward in the years ahead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Man gets 37 years for carjacking, kidnapping FBI employee in South Dakota</title>
                    
                    <description>Juan Alvarez-Sorto, a 25-year-old Salvadoran national, was sentenced to 37 years in prison Friday for carjacking and kidnapping an FBI employee in South Dakota.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of three people convicted of carjacking and kidnapping an FBI employee in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/south-dakota&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt; has been sentenced to 37 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juan Alvarez-Sorto, 25, was sentenced Friday in federal court, the Rapid City Journal reported. Alvarez-Sorto and Deyvin Morales, 29, were found guilty in January. Alvarez-Sorto also was convicted of unlawfully entering the U.S. after being deported to his home country, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/regions/central-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third suspect, 29-year-old Karla Lopez-Gutierrez, pleaded guilty in August. Morales and Lopez-Gutierrez are both scheduled for sentencing April 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/south-dakota-jury-finds-2-men-guilty-kidnapping-carjacking-fbi-employee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOUTH DAKOTA JURY FINDS 2 MEN GUILTY OF KIDNAPPING, CARJACKING FBI EMPLOYEE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said the trio left Greeley, Colorado, on May 5, 2022, and were on a &quot;drug trafficking trip&quot; to South Dakota in a Ford Expedition. Nearly out of gas at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Morales told the others they needed to &quot;take over&quot; a new vehicle, Lopez-Gutierrez testified in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A short time later, the FBI employee speeding in his Dodge Durango saw the Expedition and pulled over, believing it was a tribal officer. Prosecutors said the suspects took the Durango at gunpoint and forced the victim to go along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m still haunted by the trauma you inflicted upon me,&quot; the victim told Alvarez-Sorto at the sentencing hearing. He said Alvarez-Sorto threatened his family and held a gun to the back of his head as he was face-down in the Badlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the group stopped to buy gas and zip ties in the town of Hermosa, South Dakota, the victim managed to escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morales and Alvarez-Sorto were arrested in Greeley a week later. Lopez-Gutierrez was arrested in August 2022 in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/colorado&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Loveland, Colorado&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alvarez-Sorto’s attorney, Alecia Fuller, said his client was remorseful and noted that relatives had abused Alvarez-Sorto as a child.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Dorien Ray, 21, of McComb, Mississippi, has been arrested under suspicion he killed a 79-year-old man at a New Mexico rest stop, before stealing his car and leading police on a chase.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A suspect has been arrested after allegedly killing a man at a northern &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/new-mexico&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; rest area, stealing a vehicle at knifepoint and leading state police on a car chase, authorities said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police said 21-year-old Dorien Ray was arrested Monday on suspicion of numerous charges including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;first-degree murder&lt;/a&gt;, armed robbery and possession of a stolen vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ray allegedly was driving a car reported stolen from Aurora, Colorado, when he stopped around 7 a.m. at a rest stop in Colfax County south of Raton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/former-unm-football-player-convicted-robbing-postal-carrier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORMER UNM FOOTBALL PLAYER CONVICTED OF ROBBING POSTAL CARRIER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ray is accused of fatally stabbing a 79-year-old man while the victim’s wife was in the bathroom, State Police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colorado couple was headed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/arizona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to Arizona&lt;/a&gt; before Ray drove off in their car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman told police that the vehicle was gone when she came out of the bathroom, and her husband was on the ground covered in blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A State Police officer spotted the stolen vehicle on Interstate 25 in San Miguel County, and Ray was arrested after the pursuit ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ray is from McComb, Mississippi, according to a criminal complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ray did not have an attorney assigned to his case as of Tuesday. But authorities said he should have a public defender at his initial court appearance Wednesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Legal experts say Biden admin&apos;s legal theory in Jan 6 prosecution &apos;on the ropes&apos; after Supreme Court argument</title>
                    
                    <description>Legal experts say the DOJ was “on the ropes&amp;quot; in Tuesday’s oral arguments at the Supreme Court in a case questioning whether a Jan. 6 rioter can be charged with obstruction.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Legal experts said the Biden administration was &quot;on the ropes&quot; in Tuesday’s oral arguments &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/supreme-court&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;at the Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; in a case questioning whether a Jan. 6 rioter can be charged with a federal &quot;obstruction&quot; crime, which carries implications for former president Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Jeffrey Green, lawyer for Joseph Fischer – who is one of more than 300 people charged by the Justice Department with &quot;obstruction of an official proceeding&quot; in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol – argued that the federal statute shouldn’t apply, and that it had only ever been applied to evidence tampering cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/justice-department&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; argued that Fischer’s actions were a &quot;deliberate attempt&quot; to stop a joint session of Congress directly from certifying the 2020 election, thus qualifying their use of the statue that criminalizes behavior that &quot;otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do,&quot; and carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But legal experts told Fox News Digital that the government’s argument started to &quot;fall apart&quot; after questioning from the justices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-debate-sleeper-case-affect-trump-federal-prosecution&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUPREME COURT TO DEBATE &apos;SLEEPER&apos; CASE THAT COULD AFFECT TRUMP FEDERAL PROSECUTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Turley, a practicing criminal defense attorney and professor at George Washington University, praised Solicitor General Elizabeth Preloger as one of &quot;the best appellate litigators,&quot; but said she appeared &quot;clearly on the ropes&quot; and &quot;made some uncharacteristic concessions&quot; on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned whether, under the government’s argument, heckling at the State of the Union address or the recent incident of Rep. Jaamal Bowman, D-N.Y. pulling a fire alarm and diverting a House vote would constitute &quot;obstruction.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are multiple elements of the statue that I think might not be satisfied by those hypotheticals,&quot; Preloger replied, adding that obstruction requires &quot;meaningful interference&quot; and &quot;corrupt intent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/special-counsel-jack-smith-hits-back-judge-fundamentally-flawed-legal-premise-trump-documents-case&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH HITS BACK AT JUDGE FOR &apos;FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED LEGAL PREMISE&apos; IN TRUMP DOCUMENTS CASE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gorsuch laid bare the problems for the government&apos;s argument,&quot; Turley said. &quot;This is where the government&apos;s arguments seem to fall apart in that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When pressed… Preloger started to introduce contextual standards and said that these would just not be strong cases. And that was not the way to go, in my opinion.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrie Severino, former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas and president of JCN, noted that the government &quot;had a hard time explaining how this wasn&apos;t going to be such a broad, open door that it could allow a lot of behavior that we clearly understand to be protected First Amendment speech – peaceful protests, etc. – to get swept in the way that they&apos;re charging it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There’s not a First Amendment right to trespass or to block things. But I think you do have to worry about…this is an incredibly Draconian type of response that could be applied to things that we absolutely wouldn&apos;t believe should be subjected to a 20-year prison sentence,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Attorney General Mark Brnovich told Fox News Digital that the government &quot;shouldn’t be trying out untested or ‘novel’ theories in high-profile cases.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trials-heres-where-each-case-against-former-president-presumptive-gop-nominee-stands&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP TRIALS: HERE’S WHERE EACH CASE AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT AND PRESUMPTIVE GOP NOMINEE STANDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m a big believer in the rule of lenity. That basically means criminal statutes should be construed narrowly and when in doubt, you err on the side of the individual and not just throw stuff against the wall,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice John Roberts pressed Preloger about an opinion issued in 2019 by DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) – an office that serves as a legal adviser to the department and other executive agencies –which said that the obstruction statute should be viewed narrowly and contradicts DOJ’s position in Tuesday’s case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preloger said that opinion was never &quot;formally&quot; adopted, but couldn’t say what the DOJ’s process to formerly accept an OLC paper is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was not a good moment, or a good look for the government,&quot; Turley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There were a lot of shrugs coming from the government in this oral argument. I mean, time and time again, when pushed to the wall, the government would simply shrug off the contradiction. That&apos;s not going to work with these justices,&quot; Turley added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turley said that, should the justices decide the case in favor of the Jan. 6 defendant, it could mean that Special Counsel Jack Smith’s drops the two obstruction counts against Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The obstruction counts allowed Smith to frame the President&apos;s remarks in a conspiracy to obstruct and prevent the counting of votes. The elimination of those counts makes the narrative more challenging for Smith because those two counts were emblematic of his narrative,&quot; Turley noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That is, they specifically alleged an effort to obstruct the proceeding. Those two counts amplified that aspect of the government&apos;s theory.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decision in the case, Fischer v. United States, is expected in early summer. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Pro-life and Christian activists say that former President Donald Trump risks alienating a key voting bloc with his moderated stance on abortion ahead of the 2024 election.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Former President Trump&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; opposition to a strict abortion ban in Arizona has put him at odds with pro-life and Christian activists, who represent a voter base key to his presidential election effort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Trump presidential campaign released a statement saying that states should decide how to regulate abortion. Days later, that position was tested when the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that an 1864 law banning abortion without exception for rape or incest should be enforced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, who claims to be the most pro-life president in U.S. history, said the court&apos;s decision &quot;went too far&quot; and urged lawmakers to &quot;ACT IMMEDIATELY, to remedy what has happened.&quot; He said that &quot;ideally&quot; anti-abortion laws must contain exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. In other comments, he expressed confidence that the Arizona law will be &quot;straightened out.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That message was ill-received by Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood director turned pro-life activist, who leads the group &quot;And Then There Were None.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-arizona-pro-life-law-went-too-far-biden-camp-claims-policy-u-turn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP SAYS ARIZONA PRO-LIFE LAW WENT ‘TOO FAR’ AS BIDEN CAMP CLAIMS POLICY U-TURN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What I heard was that [Trump] is a person that does not believe in banning abortion,&quot; Johnson told Fox News Digital in an interview. She said there was a conflict between Trump&apos;s position that states should decide for themselves and his statement that Arizona went &quot;too far.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So, here was a state that said we&apos;re going to ban abortion. And now he says, &apos;well, no, I don&apos;t want you to,&apos;&quot; Johnson said. &quot;That tells me he doesn&apos;t want to ban it at the federal level. But he also doesn&apos;t believe the states should have a right to ban it at the state level.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a disappointing development &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/planned-parenthood-clinic-what-should-know-about-workers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;for Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, who spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention in support of Trump&apos;s re-election. In her speech, she said Trump &quot;has done more for the unborn than any other president.&quot; She pointed to several of his accomplishments, including reinstating the Mexico City policy — critics call it the &quot;global gag rule&quot; — which blocks U.S. federal funding for non-governmental organizations that support abortion services, as well as appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, making state abortion restrictions possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Trump takes credit for his pro-life record regularly on the campaign trail. But he has also repeatedly criticized fellow Republicans for taking a hard-line stance on the issue, blaming candidates who did not allow for exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the pregnant person is at risk, for the GOP&apos;s setbacks in the 2022 midterm elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of politicians who are pro-life do not know how to discuss this topic, and they lose their election. We had a lot of election losses because of this, because they didn’t know to discuss it. They had no idea,&quot; he said last year at a leadership summit of the Concerned Women of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-abortion-should-be-decided-the-states-will-the-people&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP SAYS ABORTION SHOULD BE DECIDED BY THE STATES, &apos;WILL OF THE PEOPLE&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pro-life cause has also suffered a handful of defeats on ballot initiatives that enshrined abortion rights protections even in red states like Ohio and Kansas. Similar initiatives in Arizona and Florida, among other states, are expected to drive up turnout in the November election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Wolfe, a former Trump official who served in the State and Defense Departments, said those defeats show that &quot;the culture in America still loves abortion, or deeply misunderstands what is happening in an abortion.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfe is the executive director of the Center for Baptist Leadership (CBL), a newly-founded nonprofit that exists to revitalize the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), America&apos;s largest Christian protestant denomination. Though the group does not endorse or support political candidates, it released a statement last week chastising Trump for his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/abortion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;abortion position&lt;/a&gt; and urging him &quot;to forsake the advice of compromising political consultants.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Wolfe described the Arizona abortion ban as &quot;a great law&quot; and encouraged Trump to make an &quot;unapologetic moral argument&quot; about how abortion &quot;ends innocent life&quot; and &quot;should be recognized as murder.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Evangelicals and Southern Baptists are eager to support candidates who show unflinching courage and make moral arguments against the civilizational suicide that is abortion. I would encourage everybody to stand strong on this issue and run to it and not away from it, because we know that human life is valuable and should be protected from the moment of fertilization until the natural death,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/arizona-supreme-court-upholds-near-total-abortion-ban&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ARIZONA SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS NEAR-TOTAL ABORTION BAN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker Wildmon, vice president and spokesman of the American Family Association, said the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/arizona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Arizona Supreme Court ruling&lt;/a&gt; was a valid ruling that recognizes the pro-life position, that life begins at conception and should be protected until natural death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While giving Trump credit for his record, Wildmon said the former president&apos;s most recent statements are &quot;out of line with his party and the entire pro-life movement.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just as slavery was a stain on our country, abortion is also a stain on our country. So in our view, since we believe that every life begins at conception, any abortion is too many abortions,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wildmon warned that Trump risks alienating a significant number of Evangelical Christian voters by attempting to appeal to independents or suburban women by watering-down his pro-life stance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The reality is that wiggling or squirming on the abortion issue isn&apos;t going to pick him up many voters,&quot; he said. &quot;It will really suppress the Evangelical Christian vote. There&apos;s already Evangelical Christians out there, a large voting bloc in the Republican Party, that have some concerns about President Trump and how he handles things and his self-control.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that Trump &quot;really needs to be moving to the right on this issue&quot; to consolidate his supporters ahead of a general election showdown with President Biden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-skewers-trump-gops-shift-abortion-so-killing-babies-ok-some-states&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BILL MAHER SKEWERS TRUMP, GOP&apos;S SHIFT ON ABORTION: ‘SO KILLING BABIES IS OK IN SOME STATES?&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Republicans triangulate their position on the issue, Democrats have attempted to portray Trump as the man singularly responsible for stripping away women&apos;s rights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Here in Arizona, they have turned the clock back more than a century on women’s rights and freedoms. The overturning of Roe was a seismic event. And this ban in Arizona is one of the biggest aftershocks yet,&quot; Vice President &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kamala Harris&lt;/a&gt; said at a campaign event in Tuscon on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She called Trump &quot;the architect of this health care crisis&quot; and argued a second Trump term would mean &quot;more bans, more suffering, less freedom.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Burch, president of CatholicVote, said Trump appears mindful that far-reaching laws that restrict abortion access could make his re-election difficult. He and the other pro-life activists interviewed for this story emphasized that Trump remains the best alternative to President Biden for pro-life voters in the upcoming election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Trump may hold the position that, under the circumstances, states shouldn&apos;t go that far. And he&apos;s certainly entitled to that position. I believe he&apos;s wrong on that, but that&apos;s a far-cry from Joe Biden, who is saying he&apos;s willing to impose a nationwide abortion at any stage, for any reason, paid-for-by-taxpayers regime on the country,&quot; Burch told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Johnson said that many pro-life activists she&apos;s met with have told her Trump has lost their votes with his criticisms of the Arizona law and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/florida-supreme-court-approves-abortion-ballot-initiative-upholding-15-week-ban&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Florida&apos;s six-week abortion ban&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;It doesn&apos;t mean that they&apos;re going to go cast their vote for Biden, but they are not going to vote for Trump&quot; she told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think that just saying that you&apos;re pro-life is not going to be good enough anymore for some pro-life voters,&quot; Johnson added. &quot;And so while I think there&apos;s a lot of people who are waiting to see, and I&apos;m one of those people who are waiting to see if Trump is going to right this ship, I think that he does need to be very careful with how he moves forward between now and the election.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Paul Steinhauser and Anders Hagstrom contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An elusive rodent considered to be a &quot;sensitive species,&quot; has been spotted on a West Virginia trail in the Allegheny mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials of Monongahela National Forest, a unit of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, posted a video on Facebook last week showing a small creature moving around in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail camera had captured a 17-inch-long rodent known as an Allegheny woodrat which is on the Regional Forester’s Sensitive Species list, the post said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/rare-gray-wolf-hunted-michigan-currently-investigation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RARE GRAY WOLF KILLED DURING HUNT IN MICHIGAN, OFFICIALS LAUNCH INVESTIGATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The footage showing the woodrat was recorded on March 12, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social media post noted that Allegheny woodrats dwell &quot;primarily in hardwood forests with plenty of rocks and boulders.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the name and size of the creature may allude to a rat, the woodrats are more closely related to mice, according to officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The population of Allegheny woodrats is slowly declining in the U.S., with an estimated population of 100,000 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in the wild,&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. Forest Service reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/colorado-park-shock-one-bear-took-400-selfies-trap-camera-woods&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLORADO PARK SHOCK: ONE BEAR TOOK 400 &apos;SELFIES&apos; VIA TRAP CAMERAS IN THE WOODS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is still speculation surrounding the rodent&apos;s decline, but scientists have a few ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Many scientists blame the gypsy moth, which harms acorn-bearing oak trees (an important food source for Allegheny woodrats) and habitat degradation,&quot; the U.S. Forest Service wrote in the Facebook post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service considered the Allegheny woodrat to be a &quot;species of concern&quot; and in some states, including Pennsylvania, the rodent is listed as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/endangered&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;threatened and protected.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common predators of the elusive creature include raccoons, coyotes, weasels, great horned owls and black rat snakes, the Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC) reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At one time, the Allegheny woodrat&apos;s range extended from southwestern Connecticut west to Indiana and south to northern Alabama. It is now extirpated from Connecticut and New York, studies in remaining northern states document decline, and its status in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;southern states&lt;/a&gt; is unknown because of a shortage of recent surveys,&quot; according to the PGC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, both adult and young Allegheny woodrats were discovered in West Virginia&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/national-parks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Harpers Ferry National Historical Park,&lt;/a&gt; making this the first time the animal had been seen for 20 years, the National Park Service wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the discovery, officials were convinced the rodent had gone extinct in the area and other parts along the Appalachian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the U.S. Forest Service for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman said Monday that Donald Trump glared at her before walking out of the courtroom, after she reported that Trump had fallen asleep.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman said she noticed Donald Trump specifically staring at her after she reported he fell asleep in the courtroom during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/april-16-trump-hush-money-trial-enters-day-two-jury&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;hush money trial&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haberman, who was part of the reporter pool in the courtroom, gave live updates on the trial and reported that Trump had fallen asleep in the courtroom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You were actually in the room for that. At one point, the pool said that he was glaring at you for several seconds. You had reported shortly before that, during a break, that he appeared to be falling asleep at one point, as that proceedings were getting tedious. Did you notice that?&quot; host Kaitlan Collins asked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haberman said she did notice and added, &quot;he made a pretty specific stare at me and walked out of the room.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trial-jury-selection-resume-possible-jurors-excused-saying-they-could-not-be-impartial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP TRIAL: JURY SELECTION TO RESUME AFTER POSSIBLE JURORS EXCUSED FOR SAYING THEY COULD NOT BE IMPARTIAL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haberman wrote on Monday that Trump had appeared to be sleeping and added, &quot;his head keeps dropping down and his mouth goes slack.&quot; Minutes later, she had reported, &quot;Trump has apparently jolted back awake, noticing the notes his lawyer passed him several minutes ago.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She claimed Trump didn&apos;t like when such things were reported on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I reported earlier that he had appeared to fall asleep. Now, we had seen him – I want to be clear that I’ve seen lots of people fall asleep in courtrooms. I’ve seen jurors fall asleep. I’ve seen judges fall asleep. If anyone falls asleep who’s a criminal defendant in a case, we’re going to report on it. But he doesn’t like when such things are reported and I’m guessing – I don’t know – that that’s what this was about,&quot; Haberman told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think that having to sit there and be captive while we all report on him is going to be deeply uncomfortable for him because he is somebody who likes to control things,&quot; she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hush-money-trial-judge-tees-up-ruling-whether-trump-violated-gag-order-should-pay-thousands&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HUSH MONEY TRIAL JUDGE TEES UP RULING ON WHETHER TRUMP VIOLATED GAG ORDER, SHOULD PAY THOUSANDS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a dozen additional jurors have been excused from participating in the trial so far Tuesday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court started on Monday with 96 potential jurors, with roughly 50 being excused on Monday for saying they could not be impartial in the case, and an additional nine were removed for other reasons. That left roughly 35 candidates on Tuesday, and now 14 of those have been excused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manhattan District Attorney Alvin&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bragg-files-motion-hold-trump-contempt-alleged-gag-order-violations-threatens-30-days-jail-time&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; Bragg filed a motion&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday to hold Trump in contempt of court, claiming he violated the gag order imposed upon him by publishing three social media posts relating to two known witnesses in his criminal trial — Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bragg is urging Manhattan Judge Juan Merchan to also warn Trump that &quot;future violations&quot; of the gag order can be punished &quot;not only with additional fines, but also with a term of incarceration of up to thirty days.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Brooke Singman contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Texas set to be fined $100,000 per day after failing to investigate allegations of abuse in foster care system</title>
                    
                    <description>U.S. District Judge Janis Graham Jack is fining Texas $100,000 per day for not adequately investigating the allegations of abuse in the state&amp;apos;s foster care system.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/federal-courts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;federal judge&lt;/a&gt; is fining Texas $100,000 per day for routinely neglecting to adequately investigate allegations of abuse and neglect raised by children in the state’s struggling foster care system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Janis Graham Jack in Corpus Christi ruled Monday that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Texas Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; agency has shown contempt of her orders to fix the way the state investigates complaints by children in its care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the third such contempt finding in a case that began with a 2011 lawsuit over foster care conditions at the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, the child welfare arm of HHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/if-you-want-fix-foster-care-heres-where-start&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IF YOU WANT TO FIX FOSTER CARE, HERE&apos;S WHERE TO START&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 427-page ruling, the judge cited a &quot;continued recalcitrance&quot; by the agency&apos;s Provider Investigations unit to conduct thorough, accurate and timely probes of allegations of abuse, neglect and exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As demonstrated by the stories of the children and PI’s failure to take any action to remedy the egregious flaws identified by the Monitors, PI represents a significant, systemic failure that increases the risk of serious harm,&quot; the judge wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas has about 9,000 children in permanent state custody for factors that include the loss of caregivers, abuse at home or health needs that parents alone can’t meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The judge’s ruling is measured but urgent, given the shocking evidence,&quot; said attorney Paul Yetter, representing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/kids-foster-care-get-love-support-they-need-angels-committed-happiness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the foster children&lt;/a&gt; in the lawsuit. &quot;Innocent children are suffering every day. After all these years, when will state leadership get serious about fixing this disaster?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at the DFPS declined comment. A spokesperson at HHS said the agency, led by Commissioner Cecile E. Young, was reviewing the order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-attorney-general-sues-biden-administration-states-ability-work-faith-based-organizations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL SUES BIDEN ADMIN OVER STATE’S ABILITY TO WORK WITH FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the state have previously said that while there is always room for improvement, state officials have sufficiently complied with the court’s remedial orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state has also argued that the court monitors haven’t reviewed a large enough sample size of children to make sweeping conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fines levied against Texas will be lifted when the state can demonstrate that its investigations are in compliance. A hearing is set for late June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2019, court-appointed monitors have released periodic reports on DFPS progress toward eliminating threats to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ossoff-blackburn-inquiry-georgias-foster-care-system-after-alleged-abuse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;foster children’s safety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A January report cited progress in staff training, but continued weaknesses in responding to investigations into abuse and neglect allegations, including those made by children. Monitors also said children aren’t told how to report sexual abuse and the state hasn&apos;t proved that it has properly trained its caseworkers to identify potential victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one case, plaintiffs say, a girl was left in the same residential facility for a year while 12 separate investigations piled up around allegations that she had been raped by a worker there. The girl remained exposed to that worker until she was &quot;dumped in an emergency room, alone, with her jaw broken in two places,&quot; the judge said. The facility was eventually shut down by the state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The fan at the center of a viral video that showed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ufc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;UFC fighter Arman Tsarukyan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; throwing punches in his direction before his bout against Charles Oliveira on Saturday is speaking out after UFC President Dana White expressed concern over a potential lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident took place as Tsarukyan was walking out toward the octagon for his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufc-star-renato-moicano-praises-american-values-urges-fans-read-economists-teachings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;UFC 300&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; fight against Olveria. Videos shared online appeared to show the 27-year-old fighter throwing a punch at a fan before being ushered forward by security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear if Tsarukyan hit the fan or what prompted that altercation, but on Monday, the man came forward to clear a few things up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obed Ardon told &lt;a href=&quot;https://bloodyelbow.com/2024/04/15/dana-white-arman-tsarukyan-ufc-300/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bloody Elbow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he was attending the fight with his brother, and while getting caught up in the excitement, he flipped Tsarukyan off as he was walking by. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’d like to apologize to Arman for provoking him by flipping him off. I was buzzing all day and the moment got to me,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was my first time attending a live UFC event, and it was absolutely incredible. I’m glad the incident wasn’t as bad as it could have been. I do want to make clear that I didn’t pull him towards me, yell out offensive words or anything of that nature. I flipped him off nothing else. Congrats to Arman on a great performance and best of luck to him against whoever he fights for the title.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/max-holloway-levels-justin-gaethje-epic-knockout-blow-final-seconds-ufc-300-fight&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MAX HOLLOWAY LEVELS JUSTIN GAETHJE WITH EPIC KNOCKOUT BLOW IN FINAL SECONDS OF UFC 300 FIGHT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the post-match press conference, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/dana-white-keeping-bud-light-ufc-beer-sponsor-brilliant-business-move-ex-espn-star-sage-steele-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;White expressed concern&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the UFC might face a potential lawsuit, but Ardon made it clear to the outlet on Monday that he has no plans to seek legal action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Ardon is hoping White might extend him an invitation to the next fight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To answer Dana White’s comments about suing: I will not sue, that never crossed my mind. My first thought was I hope I don’t get kicked out. Thank you Uncle Dana for blessing us with an amazing 300 card… and can you bless me and my brothers up with tickets to UFC 303?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tsarukyan’s record improved to 22-3-0 after defeating Oliveira in a third round decision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Elderly Army veteran carjacked delivering pizzas, survives violent attack by playing dead</title>
                    
                    <description>Ernie Aimone, 81, was attacked last Wednesday for the first time in 40 years delivering pizza in Chicago. He was punched by a teen who stole his car, then crashed it in a police chase.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ernie Aimone, 81, said he has never feared for his life in his 40 years of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/chicago&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;delivering pizzas in Chicago&lt;/a&gt; – until last Wednesday, when he was robbed by teen carjackers on his route. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I had just finished delivering a pizza, and I was walking back to my car and somebody behind me was yelling &apos;gimme the keys, gimme the keys&apos; and ran at me real fast from behind,&quot; Aimone told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the attackers punched him in the face – a &quot;glancing blow,&quot; the former Army sergeant said – and he &quot;laid down and made them think that I was unconscious&quot; while they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/robbery-theft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;took off&lt;/a&gt; with his 2015 Hyundai Sante Fe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/chicago-family-gathering-turns-deadly-after-gunfire-erupts-child-killed-7-wounded&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHICAGO FAMILY GATHERING TURNS DEADLY AFTER GUNFIRE ERUPTS; CHILD KILLED, 7 OTHERS WOUNDED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aimone said he was just two blocks away from his home and rushed there to call his boss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was all frantic, saying &apos;They got my car, They got my car. They&apos;ve got food in it from the delivery,&apos;&quot; Aimone&apos;s boss at Joe&apos;s on Higgins, Frank Demonte, said. &quot;I said &apos;Whoa, I don&apos;t care about the food, are you OK?&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours after the 9:30 p.m. carjacking, state police saw Aimone&apos;s car on an expressway, according to an incident report obtained by Fox News Digital – but the driver would not pull over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/john-wayne-gacy-lawyer-wanted-look-evil-eye-believes-least-20-more-victims&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOHN WAYNE GACY&apos;S LAWYER &apos;WANTED TO LOOK EVIL IN THE EYE,&apos; BELIEVES AT LEAST 20 MORE VICTIMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thieves crashed Aimone&apos;s vehicle in the subsequent police chase. Police arrested one underage suspect, according to a press release, who Aimone said was just 15 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His insurance may not cover the extensive damages because Aimone was using the car for commercial purposes, according to a GoFundMe started by the Gladstone Chamber of Commerce to get the beloved driver back on the road. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He’s like a local legend,&quot; president of the chamber, Dan Ciolino, told the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2024/04/14/us-news/veteran-81-punched-and-carjacked-while-delivering-pizzas-in-chicago/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;He’s been loyal to Joe’s for 40 years. He served our country. He deserves our support in his time of need.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He&apos;s delivered to so many people in the community and has such a great rapport. He&apos;s such a wonderful person,&quot; Ciolino told Fox News Digital. &quot;He&apos;ll do magic tricks for kids, he&apos;s just been so entrenched in everything on the northwest side of the city through delivering for us for so many years that everyone knows him.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the fundraising campaign was launched last Wednesday, more than $54,000 has been raised for the &quot;fixture on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/illinois&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Northwest side of Chicago,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; according to the GoFundMe page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/chicago-man-shot-9-times-while-pumping-gas-violent-easter-weekend-leaves-7-dead&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHICAGO MAN SHOT 9 TIMES WHILE PUMPING GAS, AS VIOLENT EASTER WEEKEND LEAVES 7 DEAD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demonte, who has known Aimone since his childhood when his father owned the family restaurant, said this was the first time one of his delivery drivers had run into trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[But] &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;this type of thing&lt;/a&gt; is happening a lot here… in 40 years we&apos;ve never had a driver held up or anything. This shouldn&apos;t happen to anybody, especially an 81-year-old man,&quot; Demonte said. &quot;It&apos;s disgusting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aimone emerged with just slight bruising to his face. Despite his ordeal, he intends to get back to delivering pizzas, although he may stop working into the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can&apos;t retire, I&apos;d go crazy,&quot; he told Fox News Digital. &quot;Walking the floors, watching TV – that&apos;s not me.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The food is delicious, and I like the people when I deliver… I love the people. I couldn&apos;t wait to get out there when the pandemic hit. I know a lot of people were afraid to go out and stuff, but I wanted to help the people,&quot; he said of his four decades delivering pizzas for Joe&apos;s. &quot;If they have a dog I pet it. The kids, I kind of wave to them. If I have time, a little card trick – a real fast one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daughter Robyn Aimone said the outpouring of support from their community has been heartwarming and eye-opening for her dad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;His whole life… he always thought he didn&apos;t do enough for me and my family,&quot; she told Fox News Digital. &quot;Now he can finally see that people love and respect him. Now he sees it. I think that&apos;s very important to see and to have him be acknowledged for that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aimone&apos;s daughter said her dad initially felt like a &quot;coward&quot; for &quot;not fighting back&quot; when he was attacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I said &apos;Dad, you&apos;re not a coward, you&apos;re a hero. You stayed down...  [and] you came home to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>&amp;quot;Blue Bloods&amp;quot; star Tom Selleck is releasing a new memoir about his life and career, revealing he had not always planned on being an actor.</description>

I’d never taken an acting class. I had no training, no desire.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People would say, ‘Oh, he was bitten by the acting bug’ or, ‘He wanted to be a star,’&quot; he added. &quot;I’ve never talked that way in my life. I just wanted to get a job and work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selleck reflected on his life and career in his new memoir, &quot;You Never Know,&quot; out May 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/blue-bloods-star-donnie-wahlberg-calls-tom-selleck-dad-just-become-real-family&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&apos;BLUE BLOODS&apos; STAR DONNIE WAHLBERG CALLS TOM SELLECK &apos;DAD&apos;: &apos;WE’VE JUST BECOME A REAL FAMILY&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don’t have the hooks that a lot of people do,&quot; he told People of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/tom-selleck-recalls-how-he-got-his-start&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;writing the memoir.&lt;/a&gt; &quot;I didn’t rehabilitate myself or have this tragic life. I had my own share of certainly ups and downs, but I’ve been very fortunate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though he sees himself as someone who &quot;just wanted to get a job and work,&quot; Selleck said the memoir &quot;is a lot about failing, endless failures.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you’re going to get in the acting business, you better get an appetite for it. And I tried to communicate that... Because it was kind of a long road.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selleck won a basketball scholarship to USC while majoring in business administration before landing a job as a basketball player in a Pepsi commercial. From there, he appeared on &quot;The Young and the Restless,&quot; as well as roles in Westerns before landing his breakout role in &quot;Magnum P.I.&quot; in 1980 at the age of 35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1983, he met &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/tom-selleck-family-over-fame&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;his wife Jillie Mack&lt;/a&gt; while she was performing in the musical &quot;Cats,&quot; and the couple married in 1987. They share one daughter together, Hannah. Selleck also shares a son, Kevin, with ex-wife Jacqueline Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Michigan-born star says his favorite thing about his wife is &quot;the friendship&quot; they share, adding, &quot;And Jillie&apos;s sense of humor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

                    <title>AG Garland pressed on Hur report, says Biden &apos;has no impairment&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Attorney General Merrick Garland, when asked on Capitol Hill about special counsel Robert Hur&amp;apos;s report on President Biden, said the president has &amp;quot;no impairment.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Merrick Garland vowed Wednesday that President Biden has &quot;no impairment&quot; after being pressed by a Republican lawmaker about the findings of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/special-counsel-calls-biden-sympathetic-well-meaning-elderly-man-poor-memory-brings-no-charges&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;special counsel Robert Hur’s report&lt;/a&gt; on Biden’s improper handling of classified documents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garland, speaking to Rep. Ben Cline of Virginia during a House Appropriations Committee hearing on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/justice-department&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Justice Department’s&lt;/a&gt; Fiscal Year 2025 budget request, said &quot;I have seen the president effectively guide the members of the Department of his Cabinet and his military.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garland declined to comment when asked by Cline if he agreed with Hur’s characterization that Biden is a &quot;sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,&quot; saying &quot;I&apos;ve said before, and I&apos;ll say again with respect to the report that it&apos;s improper for the attorney general to editorialize.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The president has no impairment. I don&apos;t know how many ways I can say this. I have complete confidence in the president and I reject your characterization,&quot; Garland also said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-debate-sleeper-case-affect-trump-federal-prosecution&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUPREME COURT TO DEBATE ‘SLEEPER’ CASE THAT COULD AFFECT TRUMP FEDERAL PROSECUTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hur said in his report that he would bring no criminal charges against the president after a monthslong investigation into his improper retention of classified documents related to national security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During another part of his testimony, Garland said &quot;I am glad to be able to report that last year we saw a significant decrease in overall &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;violent crime&lt;/a&gt; across the country compared to the previous year, including an over 13% decline in homicides.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-pressure-biden-doj-to-probe-activists-calling-for-death-to-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPUBLICANS PRESSURE BIDEN DOJ TO PROBE ACTIVISTS CALLING FOR ‘DEATH TO AMERICA’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That is the largest one-year decline in homicides in over 30 years,&quot; he continued. &quot;And data indicates that this decline is continuing.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garland said the Justice Department is &quot;seeking a total of $21 billion to support the efforts of the FBI, ATF, DEA, the U.S. Marshals Service and U.S. Attorney&apos;s offices, as well as the criminal Division and the National Security Division.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the funding would be used to fight gun violence and &quot;strengthen our work to counter both foreign and domestic terrorism.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Brooke Singman contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Supreme Court sides with decorated war veteran who did not receive his full educational benefits</title>
                    
                    <description>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Department of Veterans Affairs improperly calculated educational benefits of war veteran James Rudisill, who served in Afghanistan and Iraq.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/supreme-court&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday sided with a decorated veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in a protracted fight with the government over 12 months of G.I. Bill educational benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court ruled 7-2 that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/veterans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Department of Veterans Affairs&lt;/a&gt; improperly calculated the educational benefits for James Rudisill, a retired Army captain who lives in northern Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rudisill, who&apos;s now an FBI agent, is in a category of veterans who earned credit under two versions of the G.I. Bill. One version applied to people who served before the Sept. 11, 2001, attack. Congress passed new legislation after Sept. 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/footnote-supreme-courts-affirmative-action-ruling-excludes-military-academies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOOTNOTE IN SUPREME COURT’S AFFIRMATIVE ACTION RULING EXCLUDES MILITARY ACADEMIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Rudisill served both before and after the attack, including tours in Afghanistan and Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each program gives veterans 36 months of benefits, and there&apos;s a 48-month cap. Rudisill thought he had 10 months of benefits remaining under the old program, plus another year in the new system. But the VA denied the additional year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rudisill said the decision forced him to give up his plan to attend Yale Divinity School, be ordained as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/faith&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;an Episcopal priest&lt;/a&gt; and reenter the Army as a chaplain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lawyers said the decision could affect roughly 1.7 million veterans, but the VA disputed that the number is &quot;anything close&quot; to 1.7 million, noting that his lawyers didn&apos;t identify any other cases that presented the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Federal judge says Harvard Medical School professor engaged in ‘rampant plagiarism’ for Lockheed Martin trial</title>
                    
                    <description>A federal judge has ruled Harvard Medical School assistant professor Dipak Panigrahy plagiarized large portions of an export report for a Lockheed Martin lawsuit.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/former-harvard-medical-school-dean-anti-racism-social-justice-jargon-hurting-future-doctors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt; professor plagiarized extensive segments of a report on potentially carcinogenic chemicals, according to a federal judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/4/15/hms-professor-plagiarized-report/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;The Harvard Crimson&lt;/a&gt; reported that assistant professor Dipak Panigrahy previously submitted an expert report exceeding 500 pages on behalf of plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit against Lockheed Martin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report claimed that a Lockheed Martin facility in Orlando, Florida, had caused a variety of injuries, including cancer, after releasing toxic chemicals into the nearby area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Court Judge Roy B. Dalton Jr. granted a motion by the weapons manufacturer on March 18 to remove Panigrahy’s report from evidence and claimed his research lifted heavily from works by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/harvard-chief-dei-officer-accused-40-counts-plagiarism-including-plagiarizing-husband&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HARVARD CHIEF DEI OFFICER ACCUSED OF 40 COUNTS OF PLAGIARISM, INCLUDING LIFTING FROM HER OWN HUSBAND: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dr. Panigrahy’s report is — put plainly — a mess,&quot; Dalton wrote. &quot;Indeed, the plagiarism is so ubiquitous throughout the report that it is frankly overwhelming to try to make heads or tails of just what is Dr. Panigrahy’s own work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panigrahy told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt; that the court made &quot;clear factual errors&quot; and he expects the ruling to be reversed on appeal. He claimed he cited all the underlying report and articles he was accused of plagiarizing and the initial report included 1107 references. His supplemental report also included 338 references. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As I made clear in my reports and my deposition, I relied on IARC reviews for their comprehensive discussion of the available literature and study results, and then conducted my own analysis based on the body of available evidence. The Court ignored this, or did not understand this, and heedlessly accepted the defendants’ mischaracterization of my work. We expect the Judge’s order to be overturned,&quot; he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/critics-cheer-resignation-antisemitic-plagiarist-harvard-president-claudine-gay&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CRITICS CHEER RESIGNATION OF &apos;ANTISEMITIC PLAGIARIST&apos; HARVARD PRESIDENT CLAUDINE GAY: &apos;BYE FELICIA&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the judge said Panigrahy’s deposition made the plagiarism &quot;appear deliberate&quot; and claimed he repeatedly &quot;outright refused&quot; to acknowledge that huge portions of the report quote other works verbatim without quotation marks. Dalton also said he stubbornly insisted he had cited more than 1,100 references.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The volume of references actually makes the problems with Dr. Panigrahy’s methodology more glaring, as he admitted that he did not even read the 1,100 papers in their entirety,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dalton also claimed Panigraphy misrepresented IARC research and &quot;conveniently left out&quot; sentences that noted the limitations of their finding, thereby &quot;misleadingly presenting&quot; evidence as definitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In sum, the rampant plagiarism in Dr. Panigrahy’s report leads the Court to conclude that his general causation methodology as a whole is too unreliable to put before a jury,&quot; Dalton continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Harvard affiliates and faculty have also faced accusations of plagiarism over the last several months, including Harvard Business School professor Francesca Gino and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/harvard-president-claudine-gay-faces-six-new-plagiarism-charges-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;former Harvard President Claudine Gay.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

John Fetterman, D-Pa., ripped &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;anti-Israel agitators&lt;/a&gt; who have recently blocked bridges or yelled at Starbucks employees and customers, posting a strongly worded message on X Tuesday. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fetterman responded to a video posted Sunday showing protesters with a megaphone and donning Palestinian flags and other garb entering a Starbucks in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/michigan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ann Arbor, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, chanting, &quot;Starbucks, Starbucks, you can’t hide, not ‘til we free Palestine.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t know who needs to hear this, but blocking a bridge or berating folks in Starbucks isn&apos;t righteous, it just makes you an a--hole,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/senfettermanpa/status/1780226804990480419&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Fetterman wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Demand Hamas to send every hostage back home and surrender.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As hundreds of anti-Israel agitators stopped traffic in California along the Golden Gate Bridge and in Oakland on Monday, several other large protests have surfaced across the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/anti-israel-agitators-shut-down-traffic-disrupt-cities-all-across-us-demand-gaza-ceasefire&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS SHUT DOWN TRAFFIC, DISRUPT CITIES ALL ACROSS US IN DEMAND FOR GAZA CEASEFIRE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In New York City, nearly 300 protesters gathered outside the New York Stock Exchange on Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Fetterman’s home state of Pennsylvania, dozens of protesters disrupted traffic during rush hour in Center City on Monday as they waved Palestinian flags during a teach-in, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. The Philadelphia Police Department told the newspaper 67 people were arrested for obstruction of highway, as another coordinated group of anti-Israel protesters led a funeral procession of cars up I-95. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/video-shows-chicago-activists-cheer-after-learning-iran-launched-attack-israel-hands-off-iran&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;VIDEO SHOWS CHICAGO ACTIVISTS CHEER AFTER LEARNING IRAN LAUNCHED ATTACK ON ISRAEL: &apos;HANDS OFF IRAN!&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demonstrations come after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Iran launched hundreds of drones&lt;/a&gt;, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles at Israel in an attack over the weekend. The Israeli military said that 99% of the drones and missiles were intercepted by Israel&apos;s own air defenses and warplanes and in coordination with a U.S.-led coalition of partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel’s military chief said Monday that his country will respond to Iran’s attack, but he did not elaborate on when and how, as world leaders &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/israel-on-alert-as-iran-launches-drones-toward-jewish-state&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;urged against retaliation&lt;/a&gt;, trying to avoid a spiral of violence in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Stepheny Price and The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Johnson likely forced to get Dem help on foreign aid plan as Republicans decry lack of border measures</title>
                    
                    <description>Speaker Mike Johnson is facing opposition to his foreign aid plan from Republicans calling for border security measures.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/johnson-unveils-plan-fund-israel-ukraine-closed-door-house-gop-meeting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;foreign aid plan&lt;/a&gt; Speaker Johnson, R-La., unveiled on Monday night is already facing a growing red wave of opposition from his own colleagues as of Tuesday morning, making it likely he will have to seek House Democratic support to get the proposal passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Johnson’s tentative plan, aid for Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel would all be considered as separate bills. A fourth bill would combine miscellaneous national security priorities, including the House’s recently passed bill that could pave the way to a TikTok ban and the REPO Act, a bipartisan measure to liquefy seized Russian assets and send that money to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of any border security measures, however, has prompted even reliable leadership allies to be wary of letting the bills move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m thinking of voting against the rule,&quot; Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital. &quot;Unless we vote to send something to the Senate the same day that addresses the border, requires the president to take action on his executive orders. Or we can put something with the underlying legislation that would actually do a couple of things – we can stop money from going to NGOs that are transporting individuals, we can stop Homeland Security from releasing criminals into the interior.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/johnson-pitch-house-gop-israel-ukraine-aid-plans-closed-door-meeting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;JOHNSON TO PITCH HOUSE GOP ON ISRAEL, UKRAINE AID PLANS IN CLOSED-DOOR MEETING&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the four bills are designed to get separate House floor votes, they will first have to pass a procedural hurdle known as a rule vote, a House-wide measure that if passed will allow for debate and eventual votes on the four individual pieces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rule votes traditionally fall along party lines, and with Johnson&apos;s razor-thin majority, he can only afford to lose two Republicans on any party-line vote – and it&apos;s becoming increasingly likely that he might, meaning Democrats will need to break precedent to help get the bills over the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., whose disagreements with Johnson have led her to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/motion-to-vacate-filed-against-speaker-johnson-lawmakers-say&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;threaten his leadership role&lt;/a&gt;, said on Tuesday morning that she would vote against the rule unless the Democrat-controlled Senate took up the House GOP&apos;s comprehensive border security bill known as H.R.2 – which Democrats have panned as a nonstarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;NO, I am NOT voting for the rule on Johnson’s bundle of funding bills for billions more to Ukraine and other foreign wars. When Joe Biden signs HR2 into law and Schumer holds the Mayorkas impeachment trial in the Senate, I will agree to vote for the rule only,&quot; Greene said on X. &quot;Speaker Johnson is not holding Democrats accountable nor leading our Republican majority, he’s actually giving in to Democrats every demand. And he’s using dirty swamp tactics to push through the America Last agenda.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-pressure-biden-doj-to-probe-activists-calling-for-death-to-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;REPUBLICANS PRESSURE BIDEN DOJ TO PROBE ACTIVISTS CALLING FOR &apos;DEATH TO AMERICA&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, a member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, would not say how he would vote on the rule but told reporters, &quot;The rule that was proposed last night at conference will fail.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other critics of foreign aid similarly declined to say how they would vote but signaled they were opposed to Johnson&apos;s proposal itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think it leaves much to be desired. It doesn&apos;t have border control in it, it doesn&apos;t have any pay-fors in it,&quot; Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., told Fox News Digital. &quot;I think those are two problems.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Republicans, however, argued it&apos;s a better plan than the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-expected-pass-controversial-foreign-aid-bill-billions-ukraine-israel-taiwan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Senate-passed $95 trillion supplemental aid&lt;/a&gt; package that its leaders are now pressuring Johnson to take up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No one wants to swallow the senate supplemental as a whole, and if we wait any longer without taking any action, that&apos;s exactly what&apos;s going to happen,&quot; Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-tees-up-17-bills-related-to-iran-israel-for-week&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HOUSE TEES UP 17 BILLS RELATED TO IRAN/ISRAEL FOR THIS WEEK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Anthony D&apos;Esposito, R-N.Y., urged his colleagues to remember that they had already passed H.R.2 and have furiously been pushing for Democrats to take it up. He also told Fox News Digital that there were &quot;conversations&quot; about including border provisions before the text is released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think we&apos;re in a critical time that, obviously, our allies need our support more than ever, and I hope that there&apos;s a way that we could include more border security into these packages,&quot; D&apos;Esposito said. &quot;But I think we need to remind ourselves that we&apos;ve as House Republicans done our job. We sent a comprehensive border bill over to the Senate. They have failed to act.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Kiefer Sutherland recently shut down rumors that he &amp;quot;picked on&amp;quot; his younger &amp;quot;Stand by Me&amp;quot; costars once and for all.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kiefer-sutherland-shares-advice-to-new-24-legacy-star&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kiefer Sutherland&lt;/a&gt; has addressed a viral claim that he bullied &quot;Stand by Me&quot; costars Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O’Connell while on the set of the 1982 film. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a recent episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cbs-internal-review-the-talk-sharon-osbourne-racism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;The Talk,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Sutherland shut down rumors that he &quot;picked on&quot; his younger costars once and for all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After &quot;The Talk&quot; cohost Natalie Morales brought up the claim, Sutherland said, &quot;Absolutely not true. First of all, I’m not that kind of actor and I wouldn’t want to be that kind of person. I spent a lot of time with River Phoenix because we both played guitar, and so that was kind of an in to him. Even though I was seven years older, we were both beginning, right. And so there was a lot of discussion about ‘How do you develop a character, what is your process?’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kiefer-sutherland-shares-advice-to-new-24-legacy-star&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;KIEFER SUTHERLAND SHARES ADVICE TO NEW &apos;24: LEGACY&apos; STAR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, a fan wrote on X, &quot;Stand By Me fact: To keep in character while off-camera, Kiefer Sutherland often picked on Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman and Jerry O&apos;Connell.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, O&apos;Connell, who also cohosts &quot;The Talk,&quot; replied, &quot;Yes but we can take him now. Any time. Any place.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his new interview, Sutherland said he actually wishes he had more time to spend with his younger costars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Actually, it’s very funny, that at the age of 17, which I was in ‘Stand by Me’, I had probably a more in-depth process than I even do now. But we didn’t get to work together,&quot; he told O&apos;Connell. &quot;I think one of things that’s been frustrating for me when I think about ‘Stand by Me,’ is they always ask me what everybody else was like … we really only had the one big scene at the end, where Wil Wheaton pulls the gun and I had to run away like a girl.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You were 17 when you did &apos;Stand by Me&apos;? I felt like you were like 40,&quot; O&apos;Connell said. &quot;I just thought you were the most grown-up person … Now, I will say that Kiefer did not bully us, there was no bullying. But Kiefer, I was so scared of you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the appearance, Sutherland took to social media to share a photo of the mini-reunion with fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C5o1q9qvhfe/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;ig_rid=de5c0bb6-f4ea-4cd6-bc3b-8dcb43cfeb02&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APP USERS CLICK HERE TO VIEW POST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Got to visit with an old friend this morning on @thetalkcbs. @mrjerryoc … fantastic!&quot; he captioned the post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Sutherland spoke with Fox News Digital on the Critics Choice Awards red carpet and talked about the challenges of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kiefer-sutherland-admits-challenges-of-working-in-hollywood-every-three-months-im-out-of-a-job&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;working in Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Does that exist?&quot; he said when asked if he has ever fully settled into his career. &quot;You know, there have been moments where I felt calmer than others.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think &apos;24&apos; for me was a fantastic opportunity because it was the first thing that felt like a real job. I went to work five days a week, eight months to 10 months a year, and then I was lucky enough to do it nine years in a row. So, there was a moment where that made me feel calmer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH: KIEFER SUTHERLAND SHARES STRUGGLES OF WORKING IN HOLLYWOOD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But I&apos;m back to the every three months I&apos;m out of a job kind of thing,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 57-year-old added, &quot;I&apos;ve been so fortunate, I&apos;m certainly not going to complain about that. But it does take a certain kind of wear, you know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Elizabeth Stanton contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
