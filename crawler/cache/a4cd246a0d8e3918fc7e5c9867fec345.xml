                    <title>Billy Dee Williams shocks Bill Maher when arguing actors should be allowed to wear &apos;blackface&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Hollywood icon Billy Dee Williams argued that actors should be allowed to wear &amp;quot;blackface&amp;quot; during a recent exchange on Bill Maher&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Club Random&amp;quot; podcast.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Star Wars&quot; icon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/star-wars-actor-billy-dee-williams-faced-backlash-han-solo-betrayal-empire-strikes-back&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Billy Dee Williams&lt;/a&gt; floored liberal comedian Bill Maher while arguing that actors should be allowed to perform in &quot;blackface.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday&apos;s installment of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEWNzLJJ0Jo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Club Random&quot; podcast&lt;/a&gt;, Williams spoke about his past friendship with acting legend Laurence Olivier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then pointed to Olivier&apos;s Oscar-nominated performance as Othello in the 1965 film adaptation of Shakespeare&apos;s &quot;Othello,&quot; which the British performer famously donned black make-up, something Maher noted was &quot;problematic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except the black make-up wasn&apos;t what had Williams &quot;laughing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-grills-esper-not-backing-biden-calling-trump-threat-democracy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BILL MAHER GRILLS ESPER FOR NOT BACKING BIDEN AFTER CALLING TRUMP A ‘THREAT TO DEMOCRACY’: A ‘BINARY’ CHOICE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When he did ‘Othello,’ I fell out laughing,&quot; Williams said. &quot;He stuck his ass up and he walked around with his ass, you know, because Black people are supposed to have big asses.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, I understand,&quot; Maher responded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I fell out laughing,&quot; Williams chuckled. &quot;I thought it was hysterical! I loved it! I loved it! I love that kind of stuff.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-calls-covid-commission-powers-refuse-admit-they-got-it-wrong&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BILL MAHER CALLS FOR COVID COMMISSION: THE ‘POWERS THAT BE’ REFUSE TO ADMIT THEY ‘GOT IT WRONG’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Maher pointed out that &quot;they would never let you do that&quot; in showbiz today, Williams pushed back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why?&quot; Williams asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Blackface?!?&quot; a shocked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-vows-everything-can-make-sure-trump-loses-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Maher reacted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why not?&quot; Williams doubled down. &quot;If you&apos;re an actor, you should do anything you want to do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&apos;s a great point of view, but the theater would be bombed,&quot; Maher replied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-panics-trumps-gain-young-voters-biden-might-lose-because-hot-dogs-cost-more&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BILL MAHER PANICS OVER TRUMP&apos;S GAIN WITH YOUNG VOTERS: BIDEN MIGHT LOSE ‘BECAUSE HOT DOGS COST MORE’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Club Random&quot; host pointed to how 87-year-old Williams lived through the era of Hollywood discrimination where Black actors couldn&apos;t &quot;play the parts you should&apos;ve played.&quot; But Williams maintained his stance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The point is you don’t go through life feeling like, ‘I’m a victim.’ I mean, I refuse to go through life saying to the world, ‘I’m pissed off.’ I’m not gonna be pissed off 24 hours a day,&quot; Williams said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams is best known for playing Lando Calrissian in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy and has over 160 IMDB &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;acting credits&lt;/a&gt; dating back to 1959. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>South Carolina Gamecocks head coach Dawn Staley theorized the women&amp;apos;s basketball game was &amp;quot;held back intentionally&amp;quot; on Monday night before the men&amp;apos;s final.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;South Carolina head coach &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/dawn-staley-media-coverage-may-have-influenced-answer-trans-athletes-womens-sports-outkick-writer-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Dawn Staley&lt;/a&gt; reacted Monday night to her team’s national championship win over Iowa being the most-watched women’s basketball game ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley floated a theory about coverage of the women’s game ahead of the men’s basketball &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/uconn-dominates-purdue-capture-back-to-back-national-championships&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;national championship&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think women’s basketball was being held back intentionally,&quot; she said, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.on3.com/college/south-carolina-gamecocks/news/dawn-staley-womens-basketball-was-being-held-back-intentionally/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;via On3.com&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;For one reason or the other. We are bursting at the seams with talent. Young talent, great coaching, great players. People want access to our game.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley added she has had more access than ever to watching women’s basketball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’ve watched more women’s basketball games this year than any other year,&quot; she said. &quot;This is my 24th year coaching, I had access. I picked and chose what network, what streaming device. And sometimes, I had two and three devices in front of me because I wanted to tune into a lot of games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lynette-woodard-reverses-course-caitlin-clark-scoring-record-dismissal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LYNETTE WOODARD REVERSES COURSE ON CAITLIN CLARK SCORING-RECORD DISMISSAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now, we’re in full demand and everybody else around the country wants to see women’s basketball. The decision-makers are making the right decision. I don’t think we’re going anywhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gamecocks’ win over the Hawkeyes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/south-carolina-iowa-womens-basketball-national-championship-draws-record-viewership&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;drew 18.7 million&lt;/a&gt; viewers to ABC’s coverage, with a peak of 24 million viewers during the game, according to ESPN. The number is up 89% from last year and 285% from the 2022 national championship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESPN said the game was the most-watched sporting event outside of American football and the Olympics since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton faced a list of demands from students at her alma mater who denounced her as a &amp;quot;war criminal&amp;quot; this week.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hillary Clinton faced a list of radical demands from anti-Israel protesters who denounced her as a &quot;war criminal&quot; during her visit to her alma mater, Wellesly College, this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A student-run Instagram page named &quot;WC-against-HRC&quot; posted the list of demands &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton-met-student-protests-visit-alma-mater-wellesley-college-blood-her-hands&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;during Clinton&apos;s visit&lt;/a&gt; this past weekend as protesters shouted at people attending Clinton&apos;s talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As we protest, we firmly echo the demands that W alums, [Faculty for Justice in Palestine], and students have been calling on the admin to recognize since November,&quot; the group wrote, adding, &quot;Wellesley College admin and HRC have power and influence to meet our demands. The question is: Will they?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of 10 demands range from acknowledging the &quot;ongoing genocide in Gaza,&quot; to forcing the college to divest from companies they say are &quot;perpetuating the Israeli occupation of Palestine,&quot; and to cut ties with the Anti-Defamation League, an organization that tracks antisemitism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demands also call for there to be swift and decisive consequences for &quot;every reported incident of hate crimes, harassment, slander, defamation, doxxing, threats or intimidation&quot; specifically made against &quot;Palestinian advocacy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-panics-trumps-gain-young-voters-biden-might-lose-because-hot-dogs-cost-more&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BILL MAHER PANICS OVER TRUMP&apos;S GAIN WITH YOUNG VOTERS: BIDEN MIGHT LOSE ‘BECAUSE HOT DOGS COST MORE’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/the-clintons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Clinton had&lt;/a&gt; returned to campus to participate in a women-led democracy summit as well as to mark a new college center being named after her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local news outlets say angry students also circulated pamphlets around campus saying Clinton is Wellesley&apos;s &quot;most beloved war criminal,&quot; and arguing that she has &quot;blood on her hands.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School administrators acknowledged the protest but did not condemn it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I encourage all who participate in activism to follow the demonstration policy and be mindful of our Code of Student Conduct so that you remain safe for yourself, and for our community,&quot; vice president and dean of students Sheilah Shaw Horton said in a statement prior to the protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pro-palestinian-group-may-have-raised-money-hamas-broke-donation-laws-state-ag&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PRO-PALESTINIAN GROUP MAY HAVE RAISED MONEY FOR HAMAS, BROKE DONATION LAWS, STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6346572514112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Clinton is no stranger&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to facing protests during her visits to American universities. Protesters repeatedly interrupted her during an appearance at Columbia University in February, with students calling her a &quot;war criminal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday&apos;s protest comes just days after Clinton chided U.S. voters during an appearance on the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; with Jimmy Fallon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fallon asked Clinton what she would say to voters who are &quot;upset&quot; that former President Trump and President Biden are the only two choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Get over yourself. Those are the two choices,&quot; Clinton responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;One is old, and effective, and compassionate, has a heart and really cares about people. And one is old and has been charged with 91 felonies,&quot; Clinton said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>CA man Samuel Woodward will stand trial for the deadly 2018 stabbing of University of Pennsylvania student Blaze Bernstein after hate group material was found on his phone.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;More than six years after University of Pennsylvania student Blaze Bernstein was killed, the Southern California man charged with stabbing him to death in an act of hate is expected to stand trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening statements are scheduled for Tuesday in the murder case against now-26-year-old Samuel Woodward from Newport Beach, California. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-man-accused-of-killing-gay-university-of-pennsylvania-student-pleads-not-guilty-to-hate-crime-charge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;He has pleaded not guilty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodward is charged with stabbing to death Bernstein, a 19-year-old gay, Jewish college sophomore who was home visiting his family on winter break. The two young men had previously attended the same high school in Orange County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/genius-pre-med-student-seen-on-ring-video-holding-knife-seconds-before-allegedly-stabbing-his-mom-to-death&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&apos;GENIUS&apos; PRE-MED STUDENT SEEN ON RING VIDEO HOLDING KNIFE SECONDS BEFORE ALLEGEDLY STABBING HIS MOM TO DEATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernstein went missing after he went out with Woodward to a park in Lake Forest, California, in January 2018. Bernstein&apos;s parents found his glasses, wallet and credit cards in his bedroom the next day when he missed a dentist appointment and wasn&apos;t responding to texts or calls, prosecutors wrote in a trial brief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days later, Bernstein&apos;s body was found buried at the park in a shallow grave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodward picked Bernstein up from his parents’ home after connecting with him on Snapchat and stabbed him nearly 20 times in the face and neck, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNA evidence linked Woodward &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to the killing&lt;/a&gt; and his cellphone contained troves of anti-gay, antisemitic and hate group materials, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodward sought to become a member of the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, which espoused white supremacy, a year earlier, according to the prosecutors&apos; brief. He made journal entries, including one titled &quot;diary of hate&quot; that described threats he said he had made to gay people online, the brief said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A folding knife with a bloodied blade was found in Woodward’s room at his parents’ home in the upscale community of Newport Beach, authorities said. Woodward was arrested two days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodward has pleaded not guilty to murder with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/hate-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;enhancement for a hate crime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case took years to go to trial after questions arose about Woodward&apos;s mental state and following multiple changes of defense attorneys. Woodward was deemed competent to stand trial in late 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Woodward&apos;s previous lawyers said his client has Asperger&apos;s syndrome, a developmental disorder that generally causes difficulty with social interactions, and struggled with his own sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ken Morrison, Woodward&apos;s attorney, urged the public to avoid jumping to conclusions about the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For the past six years, the public has been reading and hearing a prosecution and muckraking narrative about this case that is simply fundamentally wrong,&quot; Morrison wrote in an email. &quot;I caution everyone to respect our judicial process and wait until a jury has been able to see, hear, and evaluate all of the evidence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Orange County district attorney&apos;s office declined to comment on the case ahead of trial.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Raiders&apos; Jack Jones goes scorched Earth on Patriots fans</title>
                    
                    <description>Former New England Patriots defensive back Jack Jones ripped his old team&amp;apos;s fan base last week in an explicit social media rant. He now plays for the Las Vegas Raiders.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Las Vegas Raiders cornerback &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/raiders-jack-jones-denies-purposely-fooling-young-chiefs-fan-returning-interception-touchdown&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jack Jones&lt;/a&gt; took a shot at fans of his former team on social media on Sunday as he appeared to put the past truly behind him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones came on strong for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-england-patriots&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Patriots&lt;/a&gt; in his rookie season, recording two interceptions, including one for a touchdown during the 2022 season. In 2023, Jones was waived in the middle of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Raiders claimed Jones off waivers and in seven games, he had two interceptions which he returned for touchdowns. He had 25 tackles as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones appeared to be reacting to Mac Jones’ appearance in a Jacksonville Jaguars social media video. Mac Jones signed with the Jaguars after he was released by the Patriots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They said mac look happier in Jax lol it was NE it wasn’t bill NE fans,&quot; he wrote on X, adding several thumbs down emojis, &quot;xx1000000000000.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then responded to pushback from Patriots fans on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfl-draft-prospect-drake-maye-kind-player-will-get-you-fired-ex-steelers-player-warns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NFL DRAFT PROSPECT DRAKE MAYE &apos;IS THE KIND OF PLAYER THAT WILL GET YOU FIRED,&apos; EX-STEELERS PLAYER WARNS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Pats fans didn’t like that comment LOL stop acting like yall run the world and players don’t f--- up.. players f--- up and yall don’t run the world.

                    <title>Alabama&apos;s Nate Oats waves off rumors he&apos;s leaving with Kentucky job reportedly opening</title>
                    
                    <description>Alabama men&amp;apos;s basketball coach Nate Oats made sure to note he has no plans to leave the program even as the Kentucky job appeared to open up.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/alabama-crimson-tide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Alabama Crimson Tide&lt;/a&gt; men’s basketball coach Nate Oats assured fans Monday night he plans on staying with the program despite rumors to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats released a statement to Crimson Tide fans on X in an attempt to dispel any notion he would leave to take the Kentucky job with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/john-calipari-set-take-arkansas-coaching-job-major-college-basketball-shake-up-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;John Calipari&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; seemingly on his way to Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am fully committed to this team and to this University. We have already accomplished some great things here, and there is nothing I want more than The University of Alabama to win its first national championship in men’s basketball.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Despite any rumors to the contrary, rest assured that I will continue that pursuit as your head coach.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats led Alabama to the Final Four – the first time in the program’s history. Because of his success in his first five seasons at Alabama, Oats is seen as a hot commodity for a blue-blood school to poach. However, Oats insisted he is not going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/south-carolina-iowa-womens-basketball-national-championship-draws-record-viewership&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOUTH CAROLINA-IOWA WOMEN&apos;S BASKETBALL NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP DRAWS RECORD VIEWERSHIP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calipari was finalizing a five-year deal to take the Razorbacks’ head-coaching job, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/39897887/john-calipari-focus-arkansas-coaching-search&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;ESPN reported&lt;/a&gt; late Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calipari has been the head coach of the Kentucky Wildcats since the start of the 2009-10 season and has been at the top of the college basketball coaching landscape since Derrick Rose led the Memphis-led team to the national championship in 2009 while Calipari was there. He then left for the Wildcats the next season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/kentucky-wildcats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;With Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, he has been the face of one-and-done. He would recruit the biggest and best high school basketball players around the country and lure them to Kentucky in hopes of making their NBA dreams come true. It worked for the most part, as players like Anthony Davis, Karl-Anthony Towns, Devin Booker, John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins passed through Lexington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calipari led the team to a 38-2 record in 2012 and won the national championship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There still appears to be a lot to figure out for these major SEC schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>If you missed the fun, look out for these upcoming total solar eclipses</title>
                    
                    <description>Total solar eclipses occur every few years, but they are often only able to be seen from somewhere in the ocean. These are the next times a total solar eclipse will pass over land.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Whether you saw the moon completely block the sun, were foiled by cloudy weather or weren&apos;t along the path of Monday&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/photos-solar-eclipse-draws-massive-crowds-throughout-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;total solar eclipse&lt;/a&gt;, there are still more chances to catch a glimpse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s what to know about upcoming solar spectacles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total solar eclipses happen about every year or two or three, due to a precise alignment of the sun, moon and Earth. They can occur anywhere across the globe, usually in remote areas like the South Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/solar-eclipse-photos-dogs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLAR ECLIPSE 2024: PHOTOS OF GOOD BOYS AND GIRLS IN THEIR PROTECTIVE EYEWEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save the date: The next full &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/planet-earth/solar-eclipse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;solar eclipse&lt;/a&gt;, in 2026, will pass over the northern fringes of Greenland, Iceland and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next U.S. taste of totality comes in 2033 when an eclipse brushes Alaska and Russia. And in 2044, one will cross Greenland and western Canada, touching swaths of North Dakota and Montana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An eclipse on the scale of Monday&apos;s event won&apos;t happen again until Aug. 12, 2045.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But it will be pretty spectacular,&quot; said Mary Urquhart, a planetary scientist at the University of Texas at Dallas. &quot;It’s going to go coast to coast.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That eclipse will first greet viewers in Northern California, slicing through Utah, Colorado and Mississippi on its way to Cape Canaveral, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can reuse eclipse glasses to look for sunspots — dark, planet-sized spots that appear on the sun due to tangled magnetic fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A partial lunar eclipse in September will be visible over Europe and much of Asia, Africa, North America and South America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space/astronomy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;meteor showers and supermoons&lt;/a&gt; will also grace the skies through 2024, as they do every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space enthusiasts can also visit a local planetarium or science center. The planetarium at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, will stay open the weekend after the eclipse to offer themed shows and a guided sunset meditation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People will want to come back, and want to learn more,&quot; said director Dayna Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Billionaire who helped Trump with $175M bond says he &apos;probably didn&apos;t charge enough&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Billionaire businessman Don Hankey, who provided the means for Trump&amp;apos;s $175 million bond, says the legal scrutiny brought against the money has been intense.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/billionaire-donors-plan-shower-trump-millions-april-fundraising-juggernaut&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;billionaire business mogul&lt;/a&gt; who provided former President Donald Trump with the massive bond required to appeal his case in New York says he might not have charged the former head-of-state a good price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don Hankey is the chairman of Knight Specialty Insurance, the company that supplied the $175 million bond required by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-fraud-ruling-reveals-new-york-assault-real-estate-move-your-business-out&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trump&apos;s New York civil fraud trial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hankey told Reuters in an interview that he did not charge Trump a high fee for the financial service, saying he believed it was a small risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-appeals-court-denies-trump-motion-delay-hush-money-trial-setting-up-jury-selection-next-week&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK APPEALS COURT DENIES TRUMP MOTION TO DELAY HUSH-MONEY TRIAL, SETTING UP JURY SELECTION FOR NEXT WEEK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We thought it would be an easy procedure that wouldn&apos;t involve other legal problems and it&apos;s not turning out that way. We probably didn&apos;t charge enough,&quot; Hankey told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The billionaire — who supported Trump in 2016 and is backing his re-election — said he has faced intense scrutiny from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fdny-looking-into-staff-booed-ny-ag-letitia-james-cheered-trump-ceremony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York Attorney General Letitia James&apos;&lt;/a&gt; office and other officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hankey told Reuters, &quot;We have been getting a lot of emails, a lot of phone calls. Maybe that&apos;s part of the reason he had trouble with other insurance companies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-files-motion-requesting-judge-hush-money-trial-recused-due-daughters-democrat-political-work&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP FILES MOTION REQUESTING JUDGE IN HUSH MONEY TRIAL BE RECUSED AMID DAUGHTER&apos;S DEMOCRAT-AFFILIATED WORK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m surprised they&apos;re coming down harder on our bond or looking for reasons to cause issues with our instrument,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s bond was initially set at a staggering $454 million, a value so high he struggled to find firms willing to take on the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hankey — believed to be worth over $7 billion dollars — approached the Trump campaign about rendering financial services before the bond was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-454m-judgment-bond-slashed-more-than-half-appeals-court-ruling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;reduced to $175 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The billionaire said Trump provided collateral for the bond in cash held by a brokerage firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t know if it came from Donald Trump or from Donald Trump and supporters,&quot; Hankey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jury selection for the civil fraud trial is expected to begin on April 15.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Lynette Woodard reverses course on Caitlin Clark scoring-record dismissal</title>
                    
                    <description>Lynette Woodard reversed course on her remarks about Caitlin Clark and the scoring record in an attempt to clarify what she said about the Iowa star.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Basketball legend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lynette-woodard-believes-her-scoring-record-stands&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Lynette Woodard&lt;/a&gt; reversed course and acknowledged Caitlin Clark as the NCAA all-time scoring record holder after her initial remarks sparked backlash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodard gave a nod to Clark on Instagram after Iowa lost to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/south-carolina-gamecocks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; in the national championship. Woodard wrote she would root for Clark for the rest of her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To clarify my remarks made at an awards ceremony on Saturday, no one respects Caitlin Clark’s accomplishments more than I do,&quot; she wrote. &quot;This is why I accepted Iowa’s invitation to participate in Caitlin’s senior day. My message was: a lot has changed, on and off the court, which makes it difficult to compare statistical accomplishments from different eras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Each is a snapshot in time. Caitlin holds the scoring record.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark broke Woodard’s mark, which she set before the NCAA established women’s basketball. Woodard played for Kansas in the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodard was present at the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association convention in Cleveland for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk/march-madness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;women’s Final Four&lt;/a&gt;, where she wanted to &quot;get the elephant out of the room&quot; while speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/south-carolina-iowa-womens-basketball-national-championship-draws-record-viewership&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOUTH CAROLINA-IOWA WOMEN&apos;S BASKETBALL NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP DRAWS RECORD VIEWERSHIP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am the hidden figure, but no longer now,&quot; the Hall of Famer said. &quot;My record was hidden from everyone for 43 years. … I don’t think my record has been broken because you can’t duplicate what you’re not duplicating. So, unless you come with a men’s basketball and a 2-point shot, you know … but just for you, so you can understand, so you can help me spread that word.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodard tallied 3,649 points in four seasons with the Jayhawks from 1977 to 1981, and her argument that her total should still stand comes from the fact that there was no three-point line as well as other regulations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodard mentioned men’s basketball, which is what was used in the women’s game then, unlike today, because it was a different size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Clark has obviously used the three-pointer to her advantage over her college career, draining 543 of them heading into the national championship game against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/south-carolina-gamecocks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. She has 3,921 points and counting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Clark passed Woodard, the Hawkeyes invited her to a game at Carver-Hawkeye Arena in Iowa City, where she gave Clark her flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Scott Thompson contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron met with former President Donald Trump in a surprise visit to Mar-a-Lago, ahead of his push to urge lawmakers to approve funding to Ukraine</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron met with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; in a surprise visit to Mar-a-Lago on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron, who now serves as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/former-uk-prime-minister-david-cameron-makes-surprise-return-sunak-shakes-up-cabinet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.K. foreign secretary,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is in the U.S. to urge lawmakers to back additional funding to Ukraine in its war against Russia and a spokesperson for the British government&apos;s Foreign Office described it as &quot;standard practice&quot; to meet with an opposition candidate, with Trump being the presumptive Republican nominee for this year’s presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear how the meeting went or what exactly was discussed. Trump has previously stated that he would end the war within 24 hours should he be reelected while he has also touted converting the cost of weapons &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-suggested-workable-novel-way-help-ukraine-consider&quot;&gt;transfers to Ukraine into a loan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/desperate-zelenskyy-warns-ukraine-lose-war-congress-does-not-send-more-aid&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DESPERATE ZELENSKYY WARNS &apos;UKRAINE WILL LOSE THE WAR&apos; IF CONGRESS DOES NOT SEND MORE AID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron will meet Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday to discuss the $60 billion military aid package which he has held up for months, while the pair will also discuss the Israel-Gaza war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Cameron called on Western leaders to put pressure on House Speaker Mike Johnson and Republicans in Congress to approve the additional aid for Ukraine, as Britain and the European Union have already done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Speaker Johnson can make it happen in Congress,&quot; Cameron said in a video posted on social media platform X. &quot;I’m going to go and see him next week and say, ‘Ukraine needs that money. It is American security, it’s European security, it’s Britain’s security that’s on the line in Ukraine, and they need our help.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcconnell-putting-main-part-focus-opposing-russia-ukraine-worldwide-problem-democracies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MCCONNELL PUTTING &apos;MAIN PART OF MY FOCUS&apos; ON OPPOSING RUSSIA IN UKRAINE: &apos;A WORLDWIDE PROBLEM FOR DEMOCRACIES&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A $95 billion aid package for Ukraine has been bogged down in the House of Representatives for months as populist conservatives seek to block further funding for the two-year-old conflict and some mainstream Republicans demand concessions on border security before supporting the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Cameron also urged Congress to get behind more financial aid and warned lawmakers not to show &quot;the weakness displayed against Hitler&quot; in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK has pledged almost $15 billion in overall support to Ukraine since February 2022, of which $9 billion is for military assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The war is now in its third year with no immediate end in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus and their allies are drawing lines in the sand ahead of what is expected to be an intense inter-GOP battle over additional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;aid for Ukraine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., put forward a funding plan late last month, but Freedom Caucus Chair Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., is calling for any funding to Ukraine to be balanced with spending cuts elsewhere and for it to be paired with U.S. border policy changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Ukraine funding legislation passes the House, it faces a clearer path through the Senate. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcconnell-putting-main-part-focus-opposing-russia-ukraine-worldwide-problem-democracies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.&lt;/a&gt;, has already established his support for additional help for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Anders Hagstrom and Elizabeth Elkind as well as Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Taiwan&amp;apos;s defense ministry says its military drills this year will include a scenario in which China turns one of its own exercises into an actual attack.</description>

He reportedly added that the drills would integrate naval, air, coast guard forces, drones and shore-mounted anti-ship weapons to establish an &quot;attack and kill chain&quot; at sea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Han Kuang exercises are set to begin in April with eight days of tabletop drills followed by combat exercises in July, Reuters is reporting, citing the defense ministry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In addition, [we will] use naval and air forces and coast guard ships to jointly carry out escort operations&quot; in the simulated event of a blockade of Taiwan by China, the news agency also quoted Tung as saying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-sends-warplanes-boats-taiwan-phone-call-xi-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINA SENDS WARPLANES, BOATS AROUND TAIWAN FOLLOWING PHONE CALL BETWEEN XI AND BIDEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;China had practiced blockading Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; during a round of war games last April, Reuters reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, dozens of Chinese warplanes and multiple naval ships were reported around Taiwan on the same day that Chinese President Xi Jinping held a phone call with President Biden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/taiwan-furious-china-hijacks-global-sympathy-devastating-earthquake&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAIWAN FURIOUS AFTER CHINA HIJACKS GLOBAL SYMPATHY FOR DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s defense ministry says it &quot;monitored the situation and employed appropriate force to respond.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the phone call with Xi on April 2, the White House said, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;President Biden&lt;/a&gt; emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the rule of law and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The two leaders held a candid and constructive discussion on a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues, including areas of cooperation and areas of difference,&quot; the White House added. &quot;They reviewed and encouraged progress on key issues... including counternarcotics cooperation, ongoing military-to-military communication, talks to address AI-related risks, and continuing efforts on climate change and people-to-people exchanges.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Timothy H.J. Nerozzi contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Special Counsel Jack Smith&amp;apos;s prosecutorial team urged the U.S. Supreme Court to reject former President Trump&amp;apos;s claims of immunity from criminal prosecution in the Jan. 6 case.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/special-counsel-jack-smith-hits-back-judge-fundamentally-flawed-legal-premise-trump-documents-case&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Special Counsel Jack Smith&lt;/a&gt; on Monday urged the Supreme Court to reject former President Trump&apos;s claim that he can&apos;t be prosecuted for allegedly attempting to overturn the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In prosecutors&apos; final brief before justices hear arguments in Trump&apos;s case on April 25, Smith&apos;s team argued lower courts were right to deny Trump&apos;s immunity claims. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The President’s constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed does not entail a general right to violate them,&quot; they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Trump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, faces criminal charges for allegedly conspiring to prevent Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. He denied any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-tells-supreme-court-denial-of-immunity-would-incapacitate-every-future-president-initial-brief&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP TELLS SUPREME COURT A DENIAL OF IMMUNITY WOULD ‘INCAPACITATE EVERY FUTURE PRESIDENT,’ IN INITIAL BRIEF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial is on hold until &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/supreme-court&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; rules on Trump&apos;s assertion that he should be immune from prosecution because the conduct he is accused of constituted official acts of the president. Both the judge presiding over the case, Tanya Chutkan, and a three-judge federal appellate panel in Washington have forcefully rejected that claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump appealed, and the Supreme Court agreed to hear his argument. In a brief, Trump&apos;s legal team argued a denial of his claims would &quot;incapacitate every future president with de facto blackmail and extortion while in office,&quot; and would create &quot;post-office trauma at the hands of political opponents.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-appeals-court-denies-trump-motion-delay-hush-money-trial-setting-up-jury-selection-next-week&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK APPEALS COURT DENIES TRUMP MOTION TO DELAY HUSH-MONEY TRAIL, SETTING UP JURY SELECTION FOR NEXT WEEK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith&apos;s prosecutors said the lower court rulings should stand and reiterated their argument that &quot;federal criminal law applies to the president.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The effective functioning of the Presidency does not require that a former President be immune from accountability for these alleged violations of federal criminal law,&quot; prosecutors wrote in Monday&apos;s filing. &quot;To the contrary, a bedrock principle of our constitutional order is that no person is above the law — including the President.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-files-motion-requesting-judge-hush-money-trial-recused-due-daughters-democrat-political-work&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP FILES MOTION REQUESTING JUDGE IN HUSH MONEY TRIAL BE RECUSED AMID DAUGHTER&apos;S DEMOCRAT-AFFILIATED WORK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They argued that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/constitution&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Framers of the Constitution&lt;/a&gt; &quot;never endorsed criminal immunity for a former President&quot; and said all former presidents have known they could be criminally prosecuted for acts committed while in office, even after leaving the government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors also said that even if the Supreme Court were to recognize some immunity for a president’s official acts, the justices should nonetheless permit the case to move forward because much of the indictment is centered on Trump’s private conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith and his team suggested the court could rule narrowly against Trump without setting a broad precedent that could apply to other cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A holding that petitioner has no immunity from the alleged crimes would suffice to resolve this case, leaving potentially more difficult questions that might arise on different facts for decision if they are ever presented,&quot; they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many films from the past have been made to reflect real events and real people. The films are often provided with twists doctored by Hollywood writers that aren&apos;t completely historically accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handful of these films based on real-life people have done extraordinarily well, being stamped with Hollywood’s highest honor, an Oscar nomination, and in certain cases, a win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These movies, Oscar-nominated and won, are based on real people and their stories. Plus, learn more about the individuals &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;who inspired the movies&lt;/a&gt; and where they are now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/sports-movies-real-life-people&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 MOVING SPORTS MOVIES BASED ON REAL PEOPLE AND THEIR IMPACTFUL STORIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; is a 2013 movie based on the 2007 memoir by Jordan Belfort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Belfort in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/martin-scorsese-movies-history&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Martin Scorsese-directed film&lt;/a&gt;. The movie tells of Belfort, an extremely wealthy stockbroker who was involved in illegal activity, including pump-and-dump schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belfort was sentenced to four years in prison for his crimes and served 22 months before his release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/oscars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;nominated for five Oscars&lt;/a&gt;. DiCaprio was nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for his portrayal of Belfort, and Jonah Hill was nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scorsese was nominated for Best Achievement in Directing and Terence Winter was nominated for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay. The movie was also nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/margot-robbie-acting-career-almost-ended-wolf-wall-street&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARGOT ROBBIE SAYS ACTING CAREER ALMOST ENDED AFTER ‘THE WOLF OF WALL STREET’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end of the movie touched slightly on what Belfort is up to today. A lot of his time is spent giving motivational speeches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He released another book in 2017 titled &quot;Way of the Wolf: Straight Line Selling: Master the Art of Persuasion, Influence, and Success,&quot; in addition to his first two books, &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; (2007) and &quot;Catching the Wolf of Wall Street&quot; (2009). His latest book, &quot;The Wolf of Investing: My Insider’s Playbook for Making a Fortune on Wall Street,&quot; was published in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erin Brockovich evolved as an unlikely hero in her own story. She played a large role in the case of Anderson v. Pacific Gas &amp;amp; Electric, a case settled for $333 million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/erin-brockovich-julia-roberts-first-meeting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Julia Roberts plays Brockovich&lt;/a&gt; in the 2000 movie titled &quot;Erin Brockovich.&quot; She won an Oscar as the leading lady of the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movie was also nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, Best Director (Steven Soderbergh), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Albert Finney) and Best Picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Brockovich continues to be an activist for clean water. She penned the book &quot;Superman’s Not Coming: Our National Water Crisis and What We the People Can Do About It&quot; in 2020, and she also founded the Erin Brockovich Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can tell you, since that film came out, I haven&apos;t stopped doing what I&apos;ve been doing,&quot; Brockovich told &quot;Today&quot; in 2020. &quot;I think the past 20 years in many ways have been baffling to me, because if we go back to the town of Hinkley, California, in the movie, that was just the tip of the iceberg. And I don&apos;t think I realized what was to come, and to have this conversation with you 20 years into the future to say that it&apos;s not just as bad, it&apos;s far worse. And so little has been done. I couldn&apos;t really see then that it would be everywhere.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; stars DiCaprio as a famous check forger, Frank Abagnale Jr., who is on the run from the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the crimes committed by Abagnale were between the ages of 15 and 21, according to Crime Museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Walken was nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for the 2002 movie, where he played Frank Abagnale Sr., and John Williams was nominated for Best Music, Original Score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ben-affleck-george-clooney-more-a-list-celebrities-who-played-batman-caped-crusader&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEN AFFLECK, GEORGE CLOONEY AND MORE A-LIST CELEBRITIES WHO PLAYED BATMAN ON THE BIG SCREEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his release from prison, Abagnale became an FBI consultant and lecturer, according to Crime Museum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also opened his own private financial fraud company called Abagnale &amp;amp; Associates, according to the source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Frank W. Abagnale is one of the world&apos;s most respected authorities on the subjects of forgery, embezzlement and secure documents,&quot; reads Abagnale&apos;s official website. &quot;Mr. Abagnale has been associated with the FBI for over four decades.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2015 movie &quot;The Big Short&quot; is about Michael Burry, the investor and hedge fund manager who predicted the 2008 stock market crash. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/christian-bale&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Christian Bale stars as Burry&lt;/a&gt; in the film. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movie also includes &quot;The Office&quot; actor Steve Carell, &quot;Barbie&quot; actor Ryan Gosling and &quot;Babylon&quot; actor Brad Pitt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Big Short&quot; was nominated for numerous Academy Awards, including Best Motion Picture of the Year, and won for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Burry is still investing. He shut down Scion Capital in 2008 and started Scion Asset Management, LLC in 2013, which he continues to run today from Saratoga, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official Scion website includes no information and simply refers interested parties to an email address. The private investment firm&apos;s LinkedIn is also bare, but includes a company size of 2-10 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molly Bloom ran an underground poker empire involving several Hollywood elites. In 2014, she was convicted for the illegal gambling operation that she was running. Bloom moved the operation, which started in Los Angeles, to New York City to cater to Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After she was roughed up one night in NYC, she decided to give up poker for her own safety. Bloom was the only woman charged in the underworld gambling case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2017 movie &quot;Molly&apos;s Game&quot; tells Bloom&apos;s story, based on her 2014 memoir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jessica-chastain-high-profile-american-actress-film-producer-oscar-winner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Bloom is played by Jessica Chastain&lt;/a&gt; in the Oscar-nominated film for Best Adapted Screenplay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Bloom is mother to baby girl Fiona, who was born in February 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also hosted the podcast &quot;Torched&quot; in 2022 where she focused on Olympians and Olympic sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She discussed women in sports, betting, mental health and more. She interviewed her brother, Jeremy Bloom, who is a former NFL player and two-time Olympic skier and gold medalist Kaillie Humphries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The podcast ran for two seasons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The area consists of landmarks such as the Ryman Auditorium and cultural centers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/museums-exhibits&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Frist Art Museum&lt;/a&gt;, offering exploration of diverse art forms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With plenty of shops along the way, tourists can collect plenty of souvenirs.

Various tour options are available, beginning at $30 per person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dollywood, the seasonal park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, celebrates the legacy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dolly-parton-country-music-singer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;country music icon Dolly Parton&lt;/a&gt;. Though Dolly is the main focus, this theme park intertwines elements of the Smoky Mountains and Southern culture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The park offers a mix of thrilling rides, concert stages and an array of southern food delicacies, extending a unique experience to fans of the stars and general visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ole Smoky Moonshine distillery in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, is the state&apos;s first federally licensed moonshine distillery. As visitors approach, they are greeted with the distinct aroma of cooking grains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive tours engage all senses, from observing and understanding the whiskey-making process to optional tastings. After the tour, visitors can ask questions about the production process and explore the souvenir shop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Gatlinburg is the country&apos;s most visited park. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/tennessee-aquarium-welcomes-7-baby-turtles-endangered-wilderness-experts-small-victory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TENNESSEE AQUARIUM WELCOMES 7 BABY TURTLES ENDANGERED IN WILDERNESS, EXPERTS CALL IT A ‘SMALL VICTORY’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The park welcomes more annual visitors than the Grand Canyon, Yosemite and Yellowstone combined, according to the park&apos;s website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As guests explore the park, they will encounter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;nature’s scenic splendors&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from cascading waterfalls to diverse wildlife, presented through various nature walks amid wildflowers or along the Appalachian Trail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although fall is the park&apos;s most popular season, Tennessee’s changing seasons bring unique experiences, making the Smoky Mountains a year-round attraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tennessee is home to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/travel/worlds-most-amazing-waterfalls&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;908 waterfalls&lt;/a&gt;, according to Tennessee Landforms, with a substantial number accessible to the public, despite some being on private lands or off trail. Among these, several waterfalls stand out across the state:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tennessee is an excellent year-round destination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the possibility of sudden weather changes, it is recommended to pack layers no matter the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer is the busiest time of year for tourism in Tennessee, according to Frommer’s. However, spring and fall are the most temperate seasons for outdoor activities. Although snow falls only once or twice a year, winter temperatures often dip below freezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visitors should plan their trip based on their vacation goals and the purpose of the trip.

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A naked man was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/new-mexico&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;arrested in New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; after allegedly pulling a light fixture off a home and assaulting a police officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elijah Jason Paul De Armond, 24, was arrested on Saturday at around 10 p.m. after Las Cruces police officers allegedly found him completely naked and banging on the front door of a home in the 900 block of Gilmer Way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court documents reported that De Armond arrived at the home naked, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kfoxtv.com/news/local/naked-las-cruces-man-arrested-after-ripping-light-fixture-off-homes-front-porch-900-gilmer-way-new-mexico-elijah-jason-paul-de-armond-las-cruces-police-department-dona-ana-county-detention-facility#&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;according to local outlet KFOX,&lt;/a&gt; and began banging on the front door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The homeowner told De Armond to leave the property when he allegedly became disorderly, ripped the light fixture off the front porch and broke the front glass door by throwing a rock at it, the documents allege.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-mexico-middle-school-placed-lockdown-illegal-immigrants-arrested-just-off-campus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW MEXICO MIDDLE SCHOOL PLACED ON LOCKDOWN AS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE ARRESTED JUST OFF CAMPUS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspect is also accused of breaking the front window, possibly with his hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;officers arrived&lt;/a&gt; at the scene, they shined their spotlight on De Arnold, who ran toward a patrol vehicle before an officer exited it and ordered him to get on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;De Arnold &quot;somewhat&quot; knelt on the ground and allegedly grabbed an officer who was attempting to detain him by the front of his vest, pulling on it twice, court documents said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officer then shoved De Arnold to the ground, and two officers were needed in order to arrest him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/suspect-jaremy-smith-captured-following-fatal-shooting-new-mexico-state-police-officer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUSPECT JAREMY SMITH CAPTURED FOLLOWING FATAL SHOOTING OF NEW MEXICO STATE POLICE OFFICER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also allegedly injured one of the officers by grabbing her left hand and refusing to let go until she hit him in the face several times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;De Arnold was booked into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Doña Ana County Detention Facility&lt;/a&gt; on two counts of battery upon a peace officer, indecent exposure, criminal damage to property over $1,000 and resisting, evading or obstructing an officer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Man narrowly escapes possible death in attempted car theft: &apos;Didn&apos;t know if they&apos;d try to hit me again&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Eric Smith of Puyallup, Washington interrupted a theft-in-progress from his car late one evening last week, he told &amp;apos;The Ingraham Angle&amp;apos; on Monday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The nationwide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/hochul-lying-blue-state-crime-wave-gaslighting-public-caldwell&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;crime wave&lt;/a&gt; came very close to home for one Washington state man, after his Ring video doorbell alerted him to activity in his driveway early in the morning last Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Smith of Puyallup, near Tacoma, was witnessing two men allegedly trying to steal his pickup truck. He told Fox News that when he looked out and saw his truck&apos;s door open, he pledged not to become the latest crime victim statistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said he sees stories and online posts daily involving neighbors recounting their brushes with increasingly brazen criminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m always looking at the map to see if it&apos;s close to me. And… it&apos;s not. But it just happened to be that night. And that was the situation I ran into,&quot; he said Monday on &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://FOXNEWS.COM/MEDIA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Ingraham Angle&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/dr-phil-call-action-enough-crime-wave-caused-illegal-immigration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DR PHIL&apos;S CALL TO ACTION: ENOUGH IS ENOUGH WITH THE CRIME WAVE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith raced to his front driveway and encountered a man rummaging through his truck from the passenger side, while another individual sat in a waiting car in the street. He said when he slammed his front door, the noise startled the burglar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the man tried to run, Smith chased him and eventually began grappling with him – just as the individual in the car appeared to make a K-turn and realign the vehicle with the scuffle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The getaway driver then revved the car and sped toward Smith, just as the Ring video showed Smith and the burglar briefly disengage. The driver struck Smith and appeared to brush the burglar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith appeared to jump so as not to end up under the car and was seen clinging to the windshield as the car struck the right-front quarterpanel of his pickup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/laken-rileys-death-very-concerning-wake-up-call-extent-migrant-crisis-sheriff-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LAKEN RILEY&apos;S DEATH A &apos;VERY CONCERNING&apos; WAKE-UP CALL ON EXTENT OF MIGRANT CRISIS, SHERIFF SAYS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impediment caused Smith to roll off the front of the car, and he said he was essentially uninjured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think I had the mentality, the mindset, that I didn&apos;t want this to happen to me,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[There] is a growing popularity of criminal activity in the area…. [A]s soon as I saw my truck door open, I was like, &apos;no, it&apos;s not going to happen to me&apos;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Host Laura Ingraham added that carjacking and thefts from automobiles are a nationwide issue, from Puyallup, Washington to Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith later added that once he was able to put hands on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/cali-crime-wave-beverly-hills-turned-gotham-city-gascon-caitlyn-jenner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the alleged thief, &lt;/a&gt;he realized he was a young teenager. At that moment, he believed he would be able to hold him there until law enforcement could be dispatched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But things changed very quickly when the driver of the vehicle decided to back up and try to come between us. That&apos;s exactly what happened. And I was very, very, very lucky and fortunate that it ended the way it did,&quot; Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith added he had the wherewithal to whip out his phone and attempt to photograph the getaway car&apos;s plate and its occupants after he landed on his feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If they were willing to hit me, who knows what they were going to do next. I didn&apos;t know if they were going to try to hit me again. So I tried to create that space…&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Sunday, police in nearby Federal Way, Wash., arrested a juvenile suspected of being the would-be thief in-question. The driver is still at-large, according to KOMO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Trump is right: Republicans need to reframe the abortion debate</title>
                    
                    <description>Going into the 2024 election, Republicans have dominated the major issues that matter to Americans: inflation/economy and immigration. Pivoting to abortion is not a smart move.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pro-life movement accomplished its goal: overturning the judicial precedent of Planned Parenthood v. Casey and Roe v. Wade through the conservative-leaning Supreme Court in the summer of 2022. In the blockbuster case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Supreme Court opinion&lt;/a&gt;, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, ruled in 5-1-3 decision that: &quot;We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely—the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, abortion policy was now up to individual states, not the courts. For decades, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/major-pro-life-group-lays-aggressive-plans-2024-elections-largest-ground-game-yet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;conservative pro-life movement&lt;/a&gt; lobbied for the overturning of Roe and allowing states to make abortion policy through their state representatives. And through President Trump’s appointment of three Supreme Court justices, this happened. However, abortion at the federal level has caused Republicans issues with the electorate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans need to learn how to message this delicate conversation, or we could face undertows going into November, just like we did in the 2022 midterms. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-abortion-should-be-decided-the-states-will-the-people&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Trump’s recent policy announcement &lt;/a&gt;on abortion is smart: protect IVF, oppose a federal abortion ban, create a pro-life culture, and exceptions for rape, incest, and health of the mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-abortion-should-be-decided-the-states-will-the-people&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP SAYS ABORTION SHOULD BE DECIDED BY THE STATES, &apos;WILL OF THE PEOPLE&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/abortion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Abortion has been a galvanizing issue&lt;/a&gt; for Democrats across the country. In the 2022 midterm elections, prior to Roe being overturned, Republicans were gearing up for a red wave because of Joe Biden’s unpopularity, higher inflation, and the chaos at the southern border. Even after the historic Supreme Court ruling, polling continued to look good for Republicans in purple and red-leaning House districts, as well as Senate races in Nevada, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy and inflation dominated most of the conversation nationally, which gave Republicans an advantage over Democrats, simply because they controlled the White House and Congress, and voters did not like the reckless spending and lack of security at the border. However, exit polling shows that abortion was an undercurrent issue in the 2022 midterm elections. In fact, although inflation was rated as the top issue to voters, abortion was a close second. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to NBC News, 32 percent of voters ranked inflation as the top issue, while 27 percent ranked abortion as their top issue. Voters trusted Republicans by an 8 point margin to handle inflation, while they trusted Democrats by a 10 point margin to handle abortion. The data found that 39% of voters were angry about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/abortion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision &lt;/a&gt;in June and that 21% more voters felt dissatisfied with the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That&apos;s compared to 21% of voters nationwide who said they were satisfied with the Dobbs decision and 16% more who said they felt enthusiastic about it. In what should have been a year where House Republicans had a strong majority, instead we had a very slim majority. Republicans had high hopes for flipping the Senate, instead Democrats maintained control of the upper chamber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pro-life-conservatives-are-disappointed-in-trumps-new-abortion-policy-but-stick-by-him-only-one-optiopn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO-LIFE CONSERVATIVES ARE &apos;DISAPPOINTED&apos; IN TRUMP&apos;S NEW ABORTION POLICY, BUT STICK BY HIM: &apos;ONLY ONE OPTION&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going into the 2024 election, Republicans have dominated the major issues that matter to Americans: inflation/economy and immigration. Joe Biden remains deeply unpopular, as voters do not approve of his handling of the key issues and have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;soured on his leadership&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump is in a strong position to win, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;leading Joe Biden nationally&lt;/a&gt;, in key swing states, and on the policy issues that matter to voters. Republicans are on offense in the Senate, particularly in states Trump won in 2020: Montana and Ohio. He is polling ahead of Biden in other toss-up races such as Arizona, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, which make these prime pickup opportunities for Republican challengers for the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been conversations among Republican campaign operatives to settle on a 15-week federal abortion ban, while highlighting the three major exceptions: rape, incest, and health of the mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The politics of abortion policy does not favor Republicans, it favors Democrats and helps them with independent voters who do not approve of federal abortion bans. Recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-record-number-say-abortion-should-be-legal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News polling&lt;/a&gt; shows that a record number of Americans say that abortion should be legal. That includes increased support among voters ages 65 and older (+16 points should be legal), conservatives (+12), Republicans (+11), and White evangelical Christians (+10). Voters oppose a 15-week ban by 11 points (54% oppose vs. 43% favor). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality of governing math simply does not line up either: let’s say Republicans win Ohio, Montana, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, West Virginia and Maryland. That would bring us to 58 seats in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.S. Senate&lt;/a&gt;. You need 60 votes to pass a federal abortion ban, with Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, and Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, you lose two votes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of this, if former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan were to win his Senate race in Maryland (he is pro-choice), it would result in another vote against a ban. Arizona Senate candidate Republican Kari Lake is also against a federal abortion ban and that would be another vote lost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put: Republicans do not have the votes in the Senate for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/abortion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;federal abortion ban&lt;/a&gt;. Why would Republicans run on a federal abortion ban that is 11 points underwater and has zero chance of becoming law in Congress? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump is right to take the position that Republicans should not be pushing for a federal abortion ban, which has no chance of passing even if Republicans sweep the Senate map in 2024. Instead, Republicans should talk more about policies that will help create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/abortion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;pro-life, pro-family culture&lt;/a&gt;, instead of speaking about federal abortion bans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would be a stark contrast with Democrats who are truly radical on abortion, including 2022 legislation aimed at codifying Roe, which allowed abortion up to 9 months with no restrictions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/abortion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Late-term abortion &lt;/a&gt;is opposed by the majority of Americans. States will take care of the issue, just like President Trump has rightfully pointed out.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in red states like Ohio, ballot initiatives on abortion rights have passed. And voters in Kansas rejected an amendment that would have declared citizens had no right to an abortion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans should focus more on policies that help families and women instead of unrealistic federal abortion bans. If this election is a referendum on Joe Biden because of his unpopular handling of the economy and the border, Republicans are in a good place to win. If it is about abortion, the waters get murky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/v/garrett-ventry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM GARRETT VENTRY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Maryland&amp;apos;s legislature approved a bill on Monday to support employees at the Port of Baltimore affected by last month&amp;apos;s Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse.</description>

Johnny Ray Salling told reporters Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill also allows the governor to use state reserves to help some small businesses avoid firing workers and to encourage companies that relocate to other ports to return to Baltimore when the port reopens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re proud of the fact that we as an administration and we as a state have been able to respond to the crisis of the Key Bridge, while also not losing sight that we have an aggressive legislative package that we have to get across the finish line, and we’re proud of the results,&quot; Democrat Gov. Wes Moore told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore is expected to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sign the emergency legislation&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday, which would immediately put the bill into effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/crews-begin-remove-containers-barge-hit-baltimore-bridge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CREWS BEGIN TO REMOVE CONTAINERS FROM BARGE THAT HIT BALTIMORE BRIDGE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tomorrow, I will proudly sign the PORT Act into law,&quot; the governor wrote Monday night on X, formerly Twitter. &quot;This legislation will support businesses and workers who have been affected by the Key Bridge&apos;s collapse.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers also gave final approval to the state&apos;s $63 billion budget on Friday, agreeing to some tax and fee increases to help pay for transportation and education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Biden&apos;s stealth but clever strategy to maintain control of the White House</title>
                    
                    <description>The Biden White House has initiated a surprising move that could increase voter turnout for the president and help him hold onto the White House. Republicans must understand it.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former President Donald Trump’s recent blockbuster presidential campaign fundraiser, which hauled in over $50 million in one night, begins to close the money gap between the GOP and the Democrat Party, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Republicans cannot afford to relax&lt;/a&gt; – not even for a moment. Trump supporters need to know that they are not just battling Democrats – they are up against the entire federal government.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So says Republican Claudia Tenney, who appeared on&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/person/k/larry-kudlow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kudlow&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; Larry Kudlow’s Fox Business show in recent days, saying that Democrats will do &quot;anything and everything&quot; to make sure Joe Biden is reelected. The New York Congresswoman cited the malicious prosecutions of Trump as indicative of Democrats’ dirty tricks, but also reminded the audience of&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt; Biden’s Executive Order 14019&lt;/a&gt;, issued March 7, 2021, that effectively weaponizes every federal agency – every single federal employee – to find and register voters who might help the cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forget Zuckerbucks; that infusion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2021/10/13/mark-zuckerberg-spent-419m-on-nonprofits-ahead-of-2020-election-and-got-out-the-dem-vote/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;$419 million of private money&lt;/a&gt; into 2020 official election operations, which some researchers claim boosted Democrat outreach in swing states and handed the close election to Joe Biden, is small potatoes compared to accessing the entire federal bureaucracy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/a-lawsuit-challenging-bidens-get-out-the-vote-executive-order-will-soon-head-to-the-supreme-court&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN’S GET-OUT-THE-VOTE EXECUTIVE ORDER CHALLENGED, HEADING TO SUPREME COURT: &apos;TARGET WELFARE POPULATIONS&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports that Mark Zuckerberg, one of America’s wealthiest men, was able to &quot;buy&quot; the 2020 election have inspired 28 states to pass laws outlawing the use of private funds in managing elections. Just last week, over 54% of voters in Wisconsin voted to ban the practice. Why? Because the supposedly nonpartisan money apparently went to increase voting in Biden-heavy enclaves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/wisconsin-election-integrity-state-constitutional-amendments-zuckerbucks-3b7ab709&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Wall Street Journal noted&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;A 2021 report by the Wisconsin Institute for Law &amp;amp; Liberty (WILL) found that more than 86% of the $10 million from the Center for Tech and Civic Life went to the cities of Madison, Milwaukee, Racine, Kenosha and Green Bay. &quot;The private money served to increase voter turnout for Joe Biden, but not Donald Trump,&quot; WILL found.&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because states like Wisconsin have made Zuckerbucks illegal, Democrats cannot use private funds to assist their &quot;get out the vote&quot; efforts, but thanks to Biden’s Executive Order, they now have instead the vast federal government and its 2.9 million employees. The EO demands that all &quot;agency materials, websites, online forms, social media platforms, and other points of public access&quot; be used – not to further the actual responsibilities of the Small Business Administration or Health and Human Services, for example – but to inform constituents of &quot;how to register to vote, how to request a vote-by-mail ballot, and how to cast a ballot in upcoming elections&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-stonewalling-requests-details-implementation-bidens-federal-election-scheme&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOJ &apos;STONEWALLING&apos; REQUESTS FOR DETAILS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF BIDEN&apos;S &apos;FEDERAL ELECTION SCHEME&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, the EO requires federal employees to &lt;i&gt;assist &quot;applicants in completing voter registration and vote-by-mail ballot application forms&lt;/i&gt;.&quot; In other words, federal workers – paid by taxpayer (your) dollars – are now directed to seek out and register voters; it is but a short hop to actually filling out and harvesting those ballots. As with the deployment of Zuckerbucks, &lt;i&gt;where&lt;/i&gt; those efforts take place could vastly influence the outcome of the election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lest you think this is not significant, &lt;a href=&quot;https://civilrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ProgressReport_VotingAccess.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;consider a report &lt;/a&gt;about the implementation of Biden’s EO from the &quot;Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, ACLU, and Demos and a total of 53 [left-leaning] organizations representing a diverse set of communities&quot;. They complain that 10 federal agencies surveyed are falling short of their ambitions, writing: &quot;We estimate that, if these agencies integrate a high-quality voter registration opportunity for the people they serve…they could collectively generate an additional 3.5 million voter registration applications per year.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 3 million new voters! Remember that Biden won the 2020 election by 42,000 votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EO was not just a friendly request; it orders each agency to provide a report one year later with its plan for fulfilling Biden’s demands. Interestingly, not every agency appears to be on board with the assignment. The Equal Opportunity Employment Commission, in its report, sounds a distinctly wary voice. While it agrees to help make voting materials available and allow employees to work in non-partisan roles in the election, the report also states, &quot;The EEOC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc-implementation-plan-executive-order-14019-promoting-access-voting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;takes its obligations&lt;/a&gt; under the Hatch Act seriously.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Office of the Special Counsel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://osc.gov/Services/Pages/HatchAct.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;the Hatch Act&lt;/a&gt;, passed in 1939, &quot;limits certain political activities of federal employees&quot; and is meant to &quot;ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion…&quot;​​ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the law applies only to activities undertaken while on duty, in uniform or while an employee is at work. Otherwise, federal workers are free to help out a campaign however they like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Biden acted recently to guarantee that federal employees are enthusiastic about his reelection. This month, his Office of Personnel management &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/04/biden-moves-to-defang-political-assaults-on-federal-workforce-00150446&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;adopted a rule&lt;/a&gt; that would make it harder to fire &quot;non-partisan career civil servants,&quot; which would presumably prevent Donald Trump or any other future president from attacking the so-called &quot;deep state.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move was doubtless unnecessary. An&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/american-federation-of-government-employees/totals?id=D000000304&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt; analysis of campaign contributions&lt;/a&gt; by OpenSecrets found campaign contributions by members of the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represents federal workers, go overwhelmingly to Democrats. In the 2022 midterms, for instance, less than 5% of donations went to the GOP, while 95% were directed to Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, some Democrat activists are alarmed about widespread &lt;i&gt;non&lt;/i&gt;partisan voter registration drives, because polls are showing increasing numbers of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-ripped-admitting-quiet-part-out-loud-panic-key-strategy-helping-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;non-registered Americans favor Republicans&lt;/a&gt;. While Gallup surveys from 2016 show that slightly over half of people not registered to vote leaned Democratic, in 2023 and 2024, the Democratic percentage of non-registered population dropped to 42 percent. That change will make it all the more likely that the federal push to register voters will be targeted at seeking out Biden supporters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newly-appointed chair Michael Whatley says the Republican National Committee is going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4578554-rnc-chair-were-going-to-be-in-the-room-when-votes-are-cast-counted-in-november/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;be &quot;in the room&quot;&lt;/a&gt; to monitor votes cast and counted come November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s encouraging, but can they monitor the entire federal government? We can only hope so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/p/liz-peek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Gov. DeSantis signed bills in an attempt to fight the opioid epidemic in Florida by protecting police from fentanyl exposure and raising awareness for the opioid epidemic.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Florida Gov. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ron-desantis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ron DeSantis&lt;/a&gt; signed two bills Monday that aim to address the opioid epidemic in the state by increasing penalties for exposing police to fentanyl and raising awareness for life-saving measures for someone experiencing an opioid overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeSantis, a Republican, signed Senate Bill 718 and Senate Bill 66 during a news conference at the Seminole County Sheriff&apos;s Office Professional Development Center in Sanford, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Because of the Biden administration’s unwillingness to secure the southern border, law enforcement officers are encountering fentanyl at alarming rates,&quot; DeSantis said. &quot;I&apos;m signing legislation today to keep officers safe on the job, and to further combat the opioid epidemic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senate Bill 718 would make it a second-degree felony for adults who, while unlawfully possessing fentanyl, recklessly expose a first responder to the substance, leading to overdose or serious bodily injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/hamburger-stuffed-with-fentanyl-intercepted-us-mexico-border-cbp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HAMBURGER STUFFED WITH FENTANYL INTERCEPTED AT US-MEXICO BORDER: CBP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation also expands protection from the law for people who, in good faith, solicit medical assistance on the belief that they or someone they know is experiencing an alcohol or drug-related overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senate Bill 66 will designate June 6 as Revive Awareness Day in the Sunshine State. The law directs the Florida Department of Health to raise awareness each year of the dangers of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/opioid-crisis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;opioid overdose&lt;/a&gt; and the availability and safe use of opioid counteractants to quickly reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law, also known as Victoria&apos;s Law, is named after Victoria Siegel, an 18-year-old girl who died of an accidental, lethal overdose of heroin and anti-depression medication in 2015. She was the daughter of Florida mogul David Siegel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/ice-arrests-216-illegal-migrants-with-cocaine-fentanyl-and-heroin-convictions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ICE ARRESTS 216 ILLEGAL MIGRANTS WITH COCAINE, FENTANYL AND HEROIN CONVICTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeSantis also announced that the Coordinated Opioid Recovery Network, or CORE, has expanded from 12 counties to 17 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;additional counties in Florida&lt;/a&gt;, including Bay, Broward, Collier, Hernando, Hillsborough, Indian River, Lake, Lee, Leon, Miami-Dade, Monroe, Okaloosa, Orange, Polk, Sarasota, Seminole and St. Lucie counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under CORE, Florida has seen a reduction in the number of emergency medical service responses necessary for drug overdose, the governor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Opioid addiction has been a scourge in the lives of too many Floridians and too many Americans around the country,&quot; State Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo said at the news conference. &quot;Thanks to Governor DeSantis and the support of our legislators, we are continuing to take steps to address this human tragedy. CORE’s expansion will support and treat more Floridians and serve as a model for states around the country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Why Trump is deferring to the states, after weighing an abortion ban at 15 weeks</title>
                    
                    <description>Former President Donald Trump spoke with FOX News&amp;apos; Howard Kurtz to share his thoughts on abortion policies that would make him more palatable to less conservative voters.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump told me he wanted to devise &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/abortion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;an abortion compromise&lt;/a&gt; that would &quot;make everyone happy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said I didn’t think that was possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he didn’t dispute a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York Times report&lt;/a&gt; that he was talking to advisers about banning the procedure after 16 weeks, soon modified in another interview to 15 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, in an early morning video yesterday, Trump tried to take a stand that didn’t make anyone unhappy. That’s because he embraced the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ca-sheriff-blasts-newsoms-failed-leadership-on-crime-proposes-solution-fix-disaster&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHERIFF DOESN&apos;T MINCE WORDS, CALLS OUT DEMS&apos; &apos;LIE&apos; TO VOTERS AS PLAYING ROLE IN SURGE OF VIOLENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the states should decide, both voters and lawmakers, and that some would set more conservative limits and others looser ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former president made no mention of any time limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which means things will proceed under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Supreme Court’s Dobbs&lt;/a&gt; ruling exactly as if he had made no statement at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump did take credit – not that he had much choice – for appointing the three conservative justices who helped overturn the 50-year precedent of Roe v. Wade. He thanked all six conservative Supreme Court members by name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Many states will be different, many will have a different number of weeks or some will have more conservative than others, and that’s what they will be,&quot; Trump said in the video. &quot;At the end of the day, this is all about the will of the people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden hit back hard, particularly at the assertion that legal experts on both sides wanted Roe thrown out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Trump is simply lying. There was no groundswell of support in America for overturning Roe. In fact, support for Roe is higher today in America than it has ever been,&quot; he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Trump admits as much in his statement today. Having created the chaos of overturning Roe, he&apos;s trying to say, ‘Oh, never mind. Don&apos;t punish me for that. I just want to win.&apos; Trump is scrambling. He&apos;s worried that since he&apos;s the one responsible for overturning Roe, the voters will hold him accountable in 2024. Well, I have news for Donald. They will.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/will-second-term-trump-radical-restrained-routed-by-resistance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WILL A SECOND-TERM TRUMP BE RADICAL, RESTRAINED OR ROUTED BY THE RESISTANCE?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But look at the difference. Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;makes a video,&lt;/a&gt; the Biden campaign puts out a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president loves statements, but they do little to drive television and online coverage. Unless he gets before a camera on this issue, he will have forfeited a prime opportunity – eclipsed, like the sun across America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ex-president did disappoint some on the pro-life side with his remarks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America said she was &quot;deeply disappointed&quot; and Sen. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/lindsey-graham&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Lindsey Graham,&lt;/a&gt; who favors a 15-week ban, said &quot;the states’-rights-only rationale today runs contrary to an American consensus that would limit late-term abortions and will age about as well as the Dred Scott decision&quot; – the 1857 ruling that slaves were not American citizens and could expect no federal protection even if they lived where slavery was outlawed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump responded to Graham&apos;s criticism by saying he &quot;is doing a great disservice to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/republicans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Republican Party,&lt;/a&gt; and to our Country. At first, he wanted no Abortions under any circumstances, then he was up to 6 weeks, where you’re allowed Abortion, now he’s up to 15 weeks, where you’re allowed Abortion, but what he doesn’t understand, or perhaps he does, is the Radical Left Democrats, who are destroying our Country, will never approve anything that he or the Republicans want.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at my Mar-a-Lago sit-down with the former president, he used language remarkably similar to what he released yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Democrats are the radicals on this issue because it&apos;s okay to have an abortion at seven, eight, nine months and even after birth,&quot; he told me. That last part was a reference to comments by former Virginia governor Ralph Northam – who later walked it back and said he’d only been talking about rare cases involving fetal abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6350348975112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THIS MIGHT BE A ‘TURNING-POINT’ FOR THE WHITE HOUSE: HOWARD KURTZ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump also told me that &quot;you have to have the three exceptions…now there are a few places where you don&apos;t.&quot; He cited the example of Doug Mastriano, who got creamed in the Pennsylvania governor’s race after opposing the exceptions. Trump yesterday emphasized the need to allow abortions in cases of rape, incest and the life of the mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, he said to me, &quot;But I tell people, number one, you have to go with your heart. You have to go with your heart. But beyond that, you also have to get elected.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday: &quot;You must follow your heart or in many cases, your religion or your faith.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s the thing. By talking up a 15- or 16-week ban in interviews with me and others, Trump sent an unmistakable signal that he wants that approach. Most people who have followed it know he believes that the procedure should not be allowed by the second trimester, even though that doesn’t cover the vast majority of abortions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by leaving that out of his &quot;official&quot; position, he avoids most of the political blowback. He’s just going along with what the Supreme Court mandated, despite the earlier wink and nod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to follow your heart, but first you must get elected.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A metal detectorist recently discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;400-year-old military artifacts&lt;/a&gt; while roaming around a field last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youtuber Patryk Chmielewski, who posts videos under the username Profesor Detektorysta&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;filmed himself walking through a dirt field in Mikułowice, Poland, in March. When his metal detector suddenly started pinging, he set up his camera and began digging in the soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon enough, Chmielewski &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/columns/digging-history&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;uncovered several pieces of metal&lt;/a&gt; that were buried 60 centimeters deep. Around a week later, officials from the Ministry of Science and Higher Education announced the discovery in a Polish language news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists believe that the armor belonged to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Polish hussars,&lt;/a&gt; a calvary unit in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the early 16th century to the early 18th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/strange-rock-uncovered-sea-search-turns-ancient-battle-gear&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STRANGE ROCK UNCOVERED DURING SEA SEARCH TURNS OUT TO BE ANCIENT BATTLE GEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The metal pieces that were dug up likely date back to the 17th century, officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Based on the shape of the helmet, we can very likely assess that (the armor) comes from the first half of the 17th century,&quot; an archaeologist from the Maria Curie-Skłodowska University told Science in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The archaeologist also said that it is unclear where exactly the armor was made, as it lacked decorative ornaments that noblemen usually had – which suggests it may have been made in a local workshop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is a bit corroded, we will only have greater certainty about the date of its creation after conservation work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/ancient-shipwrecks-artifacts-dating-early-3000-bc-uncovered-underwater-researchers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ANCIENT SHIPWRECKS, ARTIFACTS DATING AS EARLY AS 3000 BC UNCOVERED BY UNDERWATER RESEARCHERS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement translated to English, archaeologist Mark Florek, who works for the Provincial Office for the Protection of Monuments, said that the battle gear is &quot;incomplete.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The armor is incomplete, the basic element of the cuirass [a piece of armor that covers the torso] is missing, consisting of the breastplate and the backplate, which was used to protect the breast and back, and one of the shoulder pads,&quot; Florek explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florek also said that the armor included a left shoulder piece, a semicircular helmet and a collarbone piece that protected the neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After conservation work is complete, the artifacts will go to the Sandomierz Castle in Sandomierz, Poland, which is a medieval structure that currently functions as a museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to Patryk Chmielewski for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>UConn dominates Purdue to capture back-to-back national championships</title>
                    
                    <description>The Connecticut Huskies defended their spot atop the NCAA men&amp;apos;s basketball throne after defeating the Purdue Boilermakers to win back-to-back titles.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/connecticut-huskies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Connecticut Huskies&lt;/a&gt; are back on top for the second consecutive season after dominating the Purdue Boilermakers, 75-60, in the NCAA men’s basketball national championship game Monday night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only have the Huskies won 12 straight &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NCAA tournament games&lt;/a&gt;, but they kept their streak of defeating their opponents by double digits alive, showcasing how lethal their team is on the court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the sixth NCAA men’s basketball title for the school, with the last two under head coach Dan Hurley. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story heading into this game was how the bigs – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/purdue-boilermakers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Purdue’s Zach Edey&lt;/a&gt; and UConn’s Donovan Clingan – would match up against each other. While Edey certainly played his role as Purdue’s star with 37 points on 15-of-25 shooting with 10 rebounds, UConn’s guards ultimately made the difference on the scoreboard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tristen Newton dropped 20 points on 6-of-13 shooting with a perfect 6-of-6 from the free throw line to lead the Huskies, while Cam Spencer had 11 points and Stephon Castle hit six of his 13 shots for 15 points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/south-carolina-iowa-womens-basketball-national-championship-draws-record-viewership&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOUTH CAROLINA-IOWA WOMEN&apos;S BASKETBALL NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP DRAWS RECORD VIEWERSHIP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clingan wasn’t used as much as Edey, which was expected, but he had 11 points, five rebounds and one block to become the fourth Husky to drop double-digit points on the night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game started off as a bout between Edey and Clingan down low as both players battled for position in the paint and the points on the scoreboard went back and forth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Huskies only held a six-point lead when halftime came around, but Purdue had too much time in between points, which ultimately became a huge factor in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UConn’s lead quickly extended when Newton opened scoring in the second with his three-pointer to make it 39-30. Then, with 15:24 left in the half, UConn secured a double-digit lead after Samson Johnson, coming off the bench, drained an alley-oop dunk assisted by Newton to make it 45-34. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an Edey layup made it 47-38, the Boilermakers went on a cold streak that saw no points on the board for over three minutes until Braden Smith had two free throws. UConn had a 13-point lead at the time, and it was one they would never relinquish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking more at the stat sheet, Purdue shot just seven three-pointers on the night, making one of them. It explains why Edey’s shot total was so high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UConn wasn’t much better from beyond the arc, but they made six threes out of 22 attempts, while shooting 48.4% from the field as a team. They also out-rebounded Purdue, 35-28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
