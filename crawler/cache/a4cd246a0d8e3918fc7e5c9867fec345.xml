                    <title>Matthew McConaughey on how mom taught him manners, sent him back to bed if he was &apos;grumpy&apos; at breakfast</title>
                    
                    <description>Matthew McConaughey shared how his mother Kay taught him and his brothers manners when they were younger. He said that Kay did not tolerate ingratitude, especially at the breakfast table.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Matthew McConaughey recalled how his mother Kay McConaughey would not tolerate ingratitude — especially at the breakfast table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an appearance on the &quot;Your Mama’s Kitchen&quot; podcast with his wife Camila Alves, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/matthew-mcconaughey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;54-year-old actor&lt;/a&gt; recounted how Kay taught him and his siblings good manners from an early age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My mom was not a good cook, but she always made sure that we had hot meals, always,&quot; the Academy Award winner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&apos;s where I remember coming in and maybe being grumpy or not getting a good sleep that night or being anxious about something to do school that day,&quot; he continued. &quot;And if my attitude wasn’t great. If I didn’t go ‘Wow, look at this! Thank you for breakfast mom,’ she’d immediately jump in and go, ‘Get your butt back to your room.&apos;&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/matthew-mcconaughey-camila-alves-love-lack-drama-since-leaving-california-texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY, CAMILA ALVES LOVE &apos;THE LACK OF DRAMA&apos; SINCE LEAVING CALIFORNIA FOR TEXAS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&apos;Get back in bed, and do not come in this kitchen to have the breakfast that I made you until you’re ready to see the rose in the vase instead of the dust on the table,’&quot; McConaughey remembered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/matthew-mcconaughey-camila-alves-play-pickleball-pantless&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Texas native&lt;/a&gt; noted that was a &quot;big line&quot; for his mother &quot;that expanded beyond the kitchen as far as perspective and gratitude.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kay shared the actor and his older brothers Michael &quot;Rooster&quot; McConaughey and Pat McConaughey with his late father James McConaughey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McConaughey said that Kay stood by her rules and would &quot;chase&quot; him and his brothers &quot;all the way back&quot; to their bedrooms and make them stay there until they could come to the table with appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She goes, ‘Get back in bed.’ You’d get back in bed with your clothes and your school bag and everything and get under the covers. And she’d go, ‘Now I’m going back in the kitchen. Let’s do this over. You come back in and go ‘Wow look I got scrambled eggs or I got toast again,’&quot; McConaughey recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/matthew-mcconaughey-says-theres-initiation-process-hollywood&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The actor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;said that his mother would welcome him warmly when he came back to the table with a more positive attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She goes, ‘Good morning to you sunshine. Look at that. Another beautiful day — wasn’t guaranteed.’ That was always the kick. You had to get started on gratitude for the day,&apos;&quot; he recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&apos;Rose in the vase for the dust on the table.&apos;&quot; McConaughey said, repeating his mother&apos;s mantra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During their podcast appearance, Alves shared that she was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/matthew-mcconaugheys-mom-initiated-wife-camila-alves-family-wrong-names&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;raised with similar rules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;when it came to table manners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s the same in Brazil,&quot; the model said. &quot;It’s like you need to know who you’re eating your food from, and if the person has a bad heart, you don’t eat it. You just do not eat that person’s food.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alves explained to podcast host Michele Norris that she was referring to a common saying in Portuguese, adding that the &quot;nuts and the bolts of it is basically, you need to know who you are eating from. And if the person has bad intentions, you never eat that food.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If that person is mad at you, you never eat that food. If you had an argument, you don’t eat it,&quot; she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s funny because even today with my mom like let’s say if we for whatever reason get into a little whatever, I don’t eat her food that day,&quot; Alves said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No you don’t,&quot; McConaughey agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I skip!&quot; Alves said with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/matthew-mcconaughey-camila-alves-gift-son-15-with-instagram-account-birthday-enjoy-sharing-your-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;McConaughey and Alves,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;who tied the knot in 2021, share sons Levi, 15, and Livingston, 11, and daughter Vida, 14.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Massachusetts man dies 2 months after becoming first person to receive successful pig kidney transplant</title>
                    
                    <description>A Massachusetts man who was the first recipient of a genetically modified pig kidney transplant died nearly two months after he underwent the procedure.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/massachusetts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Massachusetts &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/massachusetts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;man&lt;/a&gt; has died nearly two months after he made history as the first recipient of a genetically modified pig kidney transplant, his family and the hospital that performed the procedure announced Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Slayman, 62, had the transplant at Massachusetts General Hospital in March, when surgeons predicted the pig kidney would last for at least two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transplant team at the hospital said in a statement it was deeply saddened by Slayman&apos;s death and offered condolences to his family. The hospital said there was no indication he died because of the transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slayman was the first living person to undergo the procedure, but pig kidneys had previously been temporarily transplanted into brain-dead donors. Two men received heart transplants from pigs, but both died within months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/massachusetts-man-recipient-first-successful-pig-kidney-transplant-discharged-hospital&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MASSACHUSETTS MAN, RECIPIENT OF FIRST SUCCESSFUL PIG KIDNEY TRANSPLANT, IS DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After having a kidney transplant at the hospital in 2018, Slayman had to go back on dialysis last year because it showed signs of failure. Then, after dialysis complications came up and required &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;frequent procedures&lt;/a&gt;, his doctors suggested a pig kidney transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slayman&apos;s family thanked his doctors for extending his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Their enormous efforts leading the xenotransplant gave our family seven more weeks with Rick, and our memories made during that time will remain in our minds and hearts,&quot; the family said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family said Slayman underwent the surgery, in part, to provide hope for the thousands of people who also require a transplant to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/massachusetts-man-receives-successful-pig-kidney-transplant-uncharted-territory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MASSACHUSETTS MAN RECEIVES SUCCESSFUL PIG KIDNEY TRANSPLANT: &apos;UNCHARTED TERRITORY&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rick accomplished that goal and his hope and optimism will endure forever,&quot; the family said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xenotransplantation refers to healing human patients with cells, tissues or organs from animals. These attempts have long been unsuccessful because the human immune system immediately destroys foreign animal tissue. Recent attempts have included pigs that have been modified, so their organs more closely resemble those of a human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 100,000 people are on the national waiting list for a transplant, with most of them being kidney patients.

During a recent interview with People magazine, Furness opened up about what the challenges of the past year have taught her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[I learned] that I&apos;m strong and resilient,&quot; Furness told the outlet at a screening of her new movie &quot;Force of Nature: The Dry 2.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And that I — we are all a constant evolution.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/hugh-jackman-wife-deborra-lee-furness-split-27-years-marriage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HUGH JACKMAN AND WIFE DEBORRA-LEE FURNESS SPLIT AFTER 27 YEARS OF MARRIAGE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While speaking with Page Six at the screening, Furness shared that she has been &quot;learning a lot about myself and I’m embracing evolution and growth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Australia native admitted her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/deborra-lee-furness-addresses-hugh-jackman-divorce-evolution-frightening&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;year of evolution&quot; &lt;/a&gt;has been &quot;scary&quot; and &quot;every other adjective.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Furness told the outlet she was &quot;grateful&quot; it presented her an opportunity for personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furness shared that leaning on friends has helped her through difficult times, including her separation from Jackman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I say this to all women — your girlfriends are a necessity in life,&quot; Furness said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While speaking with People, Furness also expressed her gratitude for having the support of her two children, son Oscar, 23, and daughter Ava, 18, whom she &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/wolverine-star-hugh-jackman-wife-deborra-lee-furness-rare-public-appearance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;shares with Jackman.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

Aaron Falk, who leads an investigation after five women set out on a remote hiking retreat but only four return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movie also stars Anna Torv, Robin McLeavy, Sisi Stringer, Lucy Ansell and Jacqueline McKenzie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furness told People she was &quot;drawn&quot; to the project because of its &quot;female-driven ensemble of actors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I love playing women that are great role models for younger girls,&quot; Furness said. &quot;Women are great leaders. … So, I like to play women who&apos;ve got something to say.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furness and Jackman announced their split in a joint statement shared with People magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have been blessed to share almost 3 decades together as husband and wife in a wonderful, loving marriage,&quot; they said. &quot;Our journey now is shifting, and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our family has been and always will be our highest priority.

In October, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/hugh-jackman-trouble-security-getting-too-close-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Marvel star&lt;/a&gt; was joined by Furness as he celebrated his 55th birthday during a dinner at New York City&apos;s Polo Club with close friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>NFL legend Jerry Rice &apos;hot&apos; over Brenden Rice&apos;s draft tumble, but confident son will prove doubters wrong</title>
                    
                    <description>Brenden Rice, the son of Jerry Rice, will start his NFL career just a few miles from where he finished his college career after an unexpected slide on draft day.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Jerry Rice is widely considered one of the greatest wide receivers in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NFL history&lt;/a&gt;. Rice&apos;s son, Brenden Rice, followed in his father&apos;s footsteps and recently became an NFL receiver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The younger Rice finished his college football career with 1,821 receiving yards. Earlier this year, he declared for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl-draft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;, and last month fell to the Los Angeles Chargers in the seventh round. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many projections had Brenden as a Day 2 or Day draft pick, his slide to the final round of the draft took some by surprise — especially his Hall of Fame father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My dad was hot,&quot; Rice told reporters as he smiled. &quot;You guys get the flash like ... the humble dude, right? Me, he&apos;s like, &apos;Hell no, we&apos;re going to take this to a different level. These guys going to feel us.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice attended his friend&apos;s funeral on the same day &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/los-angeles-chargers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Chargers&lt;/a&gt; called and told him he would be one of their draft picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was just like a blessing from God because he allowed me to go ahead and just mourn the death of my friend,&quot; Rice said, &quot;and then after that just go ahead and be happy, and it was a glorious day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfl-legend-jerry-rices-son-believes-aleb-williams-next-tom-brady-rob-gronkowski-duo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NFL LEGEND JERRY RICE&apos;S SON BELIEVES HE AND CALEB WILLIAMS COULD BE NEXT TOM BRADY-ROB GRONKOWSKI DUO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He found the silver lining in his unexpected tumble in the draft. The 22-year-old now gets the opportunity to catch passes from quarterback &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/justin-herbert&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Justin Herbert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m in the best position possible to go ahead and make my mark and make my own legacy. I went from Caleb Williams to Justin Herbert, and I&apos;m in a room that&apos;s going to allow me to compete, day-in and day-out,&quot; Rice said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chargers moved on from wide receiver Mike Williams and traded away six-time Pro Bowler &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/recently-traded-keenan-allen-refused-paycut-chargers-best-season&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Keenan Allen&lt;/a&gt; this offseason, which gives Rice an opportunity to play a significant role in the team&apos;s offense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everything&apos;s upon me. If you guys don&apos;t see me coming on this fall, that&apos;s on me. If you guys see me out there, then I put in the necessary work to put my best foot in the door and go out there and produce.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice spent the first two seasons of his college football career at Colorado, before transferring to USC in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brenden suggested that it remains to be determined whether he is a better athlete than his father was, but he is certainly motivated to surpass his dad&apos;s NFL rookie production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I feel as though we&apos;re neck and neck. I&apos;m faster, and I heard his rookie season in the NFL wasn&apos;t good,&quot; Rice said. &quot;I gotta go top him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>North Dakota Gov. and former presidential candidate Doug Burgum appeared at Donald Trump’s massive campaign rally in New Jersey on Saturday, fueling speculation he could be Trump&amp;apos;s VP pick.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;North Dakota Gov. and former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;presidential candidate&lt;/a&gt; Doug Burgum was front and center at Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, on Saturday, fueling speculation he remains a contender on the increasingly short list of potential running mates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burgum was a guest on Trump’s &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trump Force One&lt;/a&gt;&quot; campaign plan. He briefly addressed the crowd before the former president took the stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bergum said working with President Trump was &quot;like having a beautiful breeze at your back.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;President Trump respects state’s rights. He cut regulation. He lowered taxes,&quot; Burgum said. &quot;Working under the Biden regulatory regime is like having a gale-force wind in your face.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-denies-report-nikki-haley-under-consideration-vp-role&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP DENIES REPORT CLAIMING NIKKI HALEY IS ‘UNDER CONSIDERATION’ FOR VP ROLE: ‘I WISH HER WELL!’ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in Trump’s speech, the former president heaped praise on Burgum saying, &quot;he probably knows more about energy than anybody I know.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then remarked &quot;So, get ready for something, okay? Just get ready,&quot; but did not elaborate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, Trump held a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-huddling-potential-running-mates-top-republican-donors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;closed-to-press gathering&lt;/a&gt; at the Four Seasons Hotel in Palm Beach and at his Mar-a-Lago estate with top donors and a list of &quot;special guests.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those were a number of Republican politicians — including Burgum — considered to be on Trump’s shortlist for running mate. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Trump holds massive beachfront campaign rally for raucous New Jersey crowd: ‘We’re going to win’</title>
                    
                    <description>Former President Trump held a rally Saturday in New Jersey, where he predicted he would easily win the Garden State on Election Day in November.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WILDWOOD, N.J. — &lt;/strong&gt;Former President Trump held a raucous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-supporters-flock-massive-new-jersey-campaign-rally-hear-former-president-speak-amid-ongoing-trials&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;rally in New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, where on Saturday he confidently predicted he would easily win the Garden State on Election Day in November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’re going to win New Jersey,&quot; the GOP frontrunner told the crowd to exuberant cheers. U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., who briefly shared the stage with Trump, dubbed the event as the largest political rally in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;state of New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. A spokesperson for the City of Wildwood told the Associated Press she estimated there were between 80,000 and 100,000 people at the rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump devoted much of his rally to attacking his Democratic rival, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt;, whom he called a &quot;moron&quot; and the &quot;worst president that we’ve ever had.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As you can see today, we’re expanding the electoral map because … we’re going to win the state of New Jersey,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I think we’re going to win them all. All across America, millions of people, so-called blue states, are joining our movement based on love, intelligence, and a thing called common sense.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump took aim at Biden’s economic and border policies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Biden price hikes are continuing to drain over $1,000 from the typical New Jersey family budget every single month,&quot; Trump said, noting that the price of everything from hot dogs, to chicken, to gasoline and bacon, has gone up because of inflation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-son-barron-18-likes-politics-gives-advice-smart&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP SAYS SON BARRON, 18, LIKE POLITICS AND GIVES HIM ADVICE: ‘HE’S A SMART ONE&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On day one, we will throw out Bidenomics, and we will reinstate MAGAnomics,&quot; he said. &quot;And we’re going to bring manufacturing, tourism, and other industries back to New Jersey like we’ve never seen before.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several times, Trump goaded the rowdy crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You look at the Afghanistan disaster, you look at the border, you look at the economy — the real economy, not the fake economy — everything [Democrats] touch turns to what?&quot; Trump asked the crowd, prompting the crowd to shout: &quot;S---!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump also attacked Biden’s response to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and his alleged acquiescence to anti-Israel protesters on college campuses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He’s surrendering our college campuses to anarchists, jihadist freaks and anti-American extremists who are trying to tear down our American flag. They want to tear down every single place they go,&quot; Trump said, before calling on Biden and the Democratic National Committee, &quot;to return the donations of all antisemites, American haters, and financiers of chaos on our campuses.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania also had a strong showing Saturday, based on attendees&apos; cheers when asked if there were any Keystone State voters at the rally. Pennsylvania is expected to again play a key role in deciding the election after throwing support for Trump in 2016, and going blue in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-panelists-argue-stormy-daniels-michael-cohen-should-given-gag-order-too-seems-fair&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN PANELISTS ARGUE THAT STORMY DANIELS, MICHAEL COHEN SHOULD BE GIVEN GAG ORDER TOO: ‘SEEMS FAIR’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rally comes as the GOP frontrunner is facing dozens of felony charges in four separate criminal cases with the election less than six months away. The conclusion of Trump&apos;s criminal trial will see the former president either convicted or acquitted of the charges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours before he was scheduled to take the stage, thousands of Trump loyalists donning &quot;Never Surrender&quot; T-shirts and red &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; hats crowded onto the sand between the boardwalk and carnival rides to greet the former Republican president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many attendees who spoke to Fox News said they believe Trump could flip the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Garden State&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in November, when he hopes to take back the White House for a second term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most attendees who spoke to Fox News Digital listed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-supporters-flock-massive-new-jersey-campaign-rally-hear-former-president-speak-amid-ongoing-trials&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;border and the economy&lt;/a&gt; as two of their top concerns going into November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s extraordinary legal woes, which include three other unrelated criminal cases, have emerged as a central issue in the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wildwood is in New Jersey&apos;s 2nd District, which Van Drew has represented for three terms and covers all or part of six counties in southern New Jersey. It went for Trump in 2016 and again in 2020 after earlier backing Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump is set to return to the courtroom next week, when key prosecution witness Michael Cohen, Trump&apos;s fixer-turned-foe, is expected to take the witness stand. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A 48-year-old Georgia man charged with murdering 23-year-old first-year law student Tara Louise Baker and setting fire to her apartment &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/cold-case&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;23 years ago&lt;/a&gt; has been denied bond in Athens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edrick Lamont Faust has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;charged with murder&lt;/a&gt;, two counts of felony murder, one count of aggravated assault, concealing the death of another, arson, possession of a knife during the commission of a felony, tampering with evidence, and one count of aggravated sodomy, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was booked into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/georgia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Athens-Clarke County Jail.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker was found dead in her apartment on Jan. 19, 2001, after first responders were called there because of a fire that was discovered to be arson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/remains-identified-vietnam-veteran-nearly-50-years-farmers-chasing-pig-stumbled-skeleton&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REMAINS IDENTIFIED AS VIETNAM VETERAN NEARLY 50 YEARS AFTER FARMERS CHASING PIG STUMBLED UPON SKELETON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, the GBI’s cold case unit partnered with Athens-Clarke County police to &quot;conduct an in-depth review and analysis of the ongoing investigation into Baker’s death.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faust was arrested on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tara Louise Baker was a hardworking student with a bright future ahead of her,&quot;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;GBI Director Chris Hosey said in a statement. &quot;Tara&apos;s life was stolen from her in a horrific act of violence. While this arrest does not bring her back to us, I pray that it helps bring closure to the Baker family as they continue their healing journey.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/33-year-old-california-cold-case-homicide-solved-victims-sister-prayers-answered&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;33-YEAR-OLD CALIFORNIA COLD CASE HOMICIDE SOLVED AS VICTIM&apos;S SISTER SAYS ‘PRAYERS WERE ANSWERED’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker, who would have celebrated her 24th birthday the day after she was found, graduated Cum Laude from Georgia College in Milledgeville in 1998 with two bachelor&apos;s degrees, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/athens-man-charged-with-murder-in-2001-murder-of-uga-law-student-tara-louise-baker&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;according to FOX 5. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was last seen alive by friends at the University of Georgia Law School Library on the evening of Jan. 18, and she later called a friend to make sure they had gotten home safely, the station reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For many years, I have hoped the Baker family would find justice for the loss of Tara,&quot; Jerry Saulters, now Chief of the Athens-Clarke County Police Department, said in a statement. &quot;This is a case that has lived with me throughout my career at ACCPD. I remember being there during that horrific time. Seeing this case now full circle, I appreciate the hard work of the detectives, from then and now. Knowing that the evidence collected at that time contributed to the arrest today gives me tremendous pride in all the officers who worked this case over the years.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saulters had been an officer at the scene in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governor Brian Kemp praised the work of investigators in charging a suspect in the case this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Last year, I signed the Coleman-Baker Act so that we can bring closure and justice, far too long deferred, to families like this,&quot; he wrote on X on Thursday after Faust&apos;s arrest. &quot;May Tara’s memory live on through the good work of this Unit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Trump supporters flock to massive New Jersey campaign rally to hear former president speak amid ongoing trials</title>
                    
                    <description>Supporters of Donald Trump who went to hear the former president speak at a campaign rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, shared with Fox News Digital why they are supporting him in November.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Supporters of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; came out in droves Saturday to hear the former president speak at a campaign rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, as the GOP front-runner faces ongoing trials in New York, D.C., Georgia, and Florida. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rally was expected to draw more than 40,000 supporters. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., who spoke ahead of Trump, dubbed it the largest political rally in the state of New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many attendees who spoke to Fox News said they believe Trump could flip the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Garden State&lt;/a&gt; in November, when he hopes to take back the White House for a second term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rod Delaine, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/amazon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Amazon factory&lt;/a&gt; worker in Staten Island who lives in New Jersey, told Fox News Digital he drove nearly two-and-a-half hours to attend the rally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A New Jersey schoolteacher who identified herself as Anna, said she was motivated to attend because of the state of the economy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/may-10-trump-trial-new-york-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NY V. TRUMP TRIAL CONTINUES AFTER JUDGE DENIES DEFENSE MOTION FOR MISTRIAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another supporter, who identified himself as Carlos, said he believed the country needed to go back to the way things were under the former president. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think this country needs to change — although, we already know what Trump&apos;s all about. So, that change is just going to come right back to us because that&apos;s what we need,&quot; Carlos said. &quot;We need Trump because I don&apos;t think Biden is just getting the job done right now. Some of it&apos;s his fault. Some of it is probably the people around him. But I think we need Trump back to get this country back to where it needs to be.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about Trump’s prospect in November, Carlos pointed to the large crowd gathering and said: &quot;Take a look.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There’s probably about six to 7,000 people waiting online and probably more. [The line] goes all the way back to the entrance. So, you’re looking at 35- to 40,000 people at this venue right now,&quot; he said, noting that some people had been waiting since Thursday for the venue to open.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another attendee, who identified himself as &quot;Frank from PA,&quot; owns a small landscaping business. He told Fox News Digital his struggling business was a huge factor in supporting Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Finding help is hard. And the cost of fuel and everything has just been outrageous,&quot; he said, adding that gas has gone up &quot;exponentially&quot; under the Biden administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m looking forward to things turning around and getting better again,&quot; he said. &quot;The majority of people that I know in my industry are not fans of Biden, because they&apos;re struggling just like I am.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another attendee, who identified herself as Lucille from Forked River, New Jersey, said she felt &quot;hopeful&quot; about the 2024 election. Asked what her biggest concern was this election season, she said: &quot;Immigration&quot; and &quot;closing the borders.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everything else will fall into place,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two other attendees – Ronnie Felino and Kate Statlin from New Jersey – told Fox News Digital, &quot;we need him back.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Felino said the border topped her list of concerns. She said she was &quot;absolutely terrified&quot; and &quot;we need to get this under control.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another attendee named Lisa Stelling, who drove from Westcheester County, New York, described herself as a &quot;convert,&quot; despite having come from a long line of liberals in her family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s just like, something overnight shifted in the culture that I didn&apos;t realize,&quot; she said. &quot;I was taking stuff at face value and the minute the walls came crumbling down, I just started [going] deep into everything.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She argued that there many others like her whom she dubbed the &quot;silent majority.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The secret to Donald Trump winning this year is that there are a whole bunch of silent majority Trump supporters who hiding in the shadows because of all the nonsense that happened,&quot; she said. &quot;They&apos;re going to come out and they going to vote big time.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a developing story. Check back for updates. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Viral flower hacks are busted by floral expert: &apos;Good intentions gone a little too far&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>A New York City-based floral expert is debunking a variety of viral flower care hacks that have taken over social media. He also shares three tips to keep your flowers alive and well.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With spring in full bloom, now is the time that many of us are filling our homes with beautiful flowers, from hydrangeas to peonies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media users appear to be sharing various tips and tricks that claim to help people get the most out of your florals — but not all hacks are alike. Some are actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/odd-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;complete myths.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justin Leviano, product and floral design manager with Urban Stems in Manhattan, said various flower care myths have circulated on the web, such as putting a penny in water to help tulips stand up straight, or placing aspirin in the flowers&apos; water to keep blooms staying fresh for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/hot-flower-trends-2024-whats-in-whats-out-blooms&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOT FLOWER TRENDS FOR 2024: HERE&apos;S WHAT&apos;S IN AND WHAT&apos;S OUT IN THE WORLD OF BLOOMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other trends that Leviano said he&apos;s seen take off are lemon-lime soda and bleach as a substitution for flower food — or cutting flower stems underwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of these hacks are the same thing — they&apos;re kind of like a placebo of sorts,&quot; Leviano told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/good-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;good intentions&lt;/a&gt; gone a little too far.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/beautiful-floral-arrangements-springtime-easier-create-you-think&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BEAUTIFUL FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS IN SPRINGTIME ARE EASIER TO CREATE THAN YOU THINK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest hack that&apos;s having a viral moment shows people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/easy-flowers-plant-spring-gardening-tools&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;cutting flower stems&lt;/a&gt; underwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One social media user garnered over 23 million views on Instagram after sharing the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leviano said the reason behind this idea comes from the need to hydrate flowers after cutting them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As long as you cut your flower and your stem, whatever it may be, and then you get it into water in the next minute or two, it&apos;s not going to seal up. It will still be able to hydrate just fine,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/indoor-plants-spring-season&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STUNNING INDOOR HOUSEPLANTS TO BRIGHTEN ANY SPACE IN YOUR HOME THIS SPRING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The cutting [a flower] underwater is an attempt to minimize the amount of time that your flower spends out of the water after you cut it, because if you cut a flower [and] you do leave it out of water for 5 or 10 minutes, that stem will seal back up and it will be unable to hydrate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leviano addressed another flower care trend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of snipping, people are smashing woody stems, like those of hydrangeas or lilacs, with a heavy pan or hammer — but he said this hack may actually do more damage than believed to your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/budget-wedding-florals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;beautiful, new flowers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/state-flower-quiz-match-flowers-correct-states&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STATE FLOWER QUIZ! CAN YOU MATCH THESE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS WITH THEIR CORRECT STATES?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Leviano suggested cutting the stems at an angle to the user&apos;s desirable length — then cutting the stem in half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That opens up the stem and allows water to soak in, and it keeps the stem intact in a way that smashing it doesn&apos;t.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another tip to keep your hydrangeas alive: Soak the top in room-temperature water, which will act as a water bath for the flower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hydrangeas kind of hydrate through their petals, which is amazing, but they do it more effectively if you take the whole flower stem blooms and all and really submerge it in some nice, warm, almost bath-temperature water.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/ways-turn-boring-bouquet-personalized-masterpiece&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 WAYS TO TURN A BORING BOUQUET INTO A PERSONALIZED MASTERPIECE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leviano said this method will open up the pores and get water into the flower&apos;s stem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And you want to do that for about 30 minutes to an hour and then take the stems out of water and blot the flowers dry pretty carefully with a paper towel,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea is better than simply misting the flower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When you mist and then leave some of that water sitting on the petals, you can end up with a little bit of a decay moment, which is no one&apos;s favorite vibe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/sunflower-garden-tips&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADD A SPLASH OF COLOR TO YOUR YARD WITH A SUNFLOWER GARDEN: TIPS FOR PLANTING, MAINTAINING THE FLOWER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leviano said there&apos;s also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/repelling-flies-water-pennies-does-trick-work&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;penny-in-the-water hack&lt;/a&gt; for tulips that floral lovers think will help their blooms stick up straight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trick, however, is apparently not all it&apos;s cracked up to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People are getting tulips, and when tulips are not hydrated, they&apos;re a little bit bendy. They&apos;re kind of droopy. Once you cut them and hydrate them for about 12 hours, they will straighten up and start to move toward light right there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, &quot;What&apos;s happening is people get their tulips, they cut them, put them in water with the penny — and then they see tulips doing what they naturally do, standing more upright and stretching their necks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/spring-2024-backyard-game-plants-more-gifts-grab-amazon-now&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPRING 2024: A BACKYARD GAME, PLANTS AND MORE GIFTS TO GRAB ON AMAZON NOW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And people &quot;think it&apos;s because of the penny,&quot; he said. &quot;Full fantasy. It&apos;s not the penny.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irony is that pennies are covered in bacteria — which then introduces contaminants into the water, which can instead hurt the life of tulips, Leviano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along those same lines is the aspirin-in-the-&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/british-woman-viral-bringing-dying-plants-back-life-hysterical-5-hack-genius&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;flower-water trick,&lt;/a&gt; believed to help sterilize the water because of its antibacterial ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is another placebo effect with no proven results, according to Leviano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep your flowers alive for longer, consider the following three tips from Leviano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;/strong&gt;The first and most important thing to do for your flowers is give them fresh, clean water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Then, cut the stems at an angle to &quot;maximize the surface area where the flower can hydrate,&quot; Leviano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; The final thing you can do to maximize flower life is to use flower food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And use it often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s going to minimize bacterial growth in the water, which is ultimately what kills your flowers most of the time,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s also going to give a little bit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/advanced-gardening-tips&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;nutrition to the flowers.&lt;/a&gt; It&apos;s going to give them a little bit of like it&apos;s a sugar element that helps them bloom open.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use only a portion of the flower food when you first get your bouquet ready and save the rest for later in the week as you change out the water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ll also want to create a new angular stem cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is something special about having fresh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/house-and-home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;flowers in your home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; which could make the extra care worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[Flowers] truly enrich our lives. [You] get to receive the beauty,&quot; said Leviano. &quot;You get to sit with it, enjoy it, be nourished by it — and that, to me, has value.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said, &quot;It&apos;s a reminder [to] stop and smell the roses.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it&apos;s &quot;a horrible cliche at this point,&quot; he added, &quot;it really is [true].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former Nickelodeon star &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/925977606001&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Miranda Cosgrove&lt;/a&gt; reflected on a terrifying experience she had with a stalker that traumatizes her eight years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, a man who was stalking the &quot;iCarly&quot; alum, 30, lit himself on fire and fatally shot himself in the front yard of her Los Angeles home. Prior to his death by suicide, the man shot at a woman driving by Cosgrove&apos;s house who he mistook for the actress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an interview with Bustle, Cosgrove, who still lives at the home where the incident occurred, acknowledged she still doesn&apos;t feel entirely comfortable staying there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That’s another reason why I go back and forth to my parents’ house so much,&quot; Cosgrove told the outlet. &quot;I just don’t feel super safe in that house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/icarly-miranda-cosgrove-revival-teen-fame&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘ICARLY’ STAR MIRANDA COSGROVE SAYS IT WAS ‘SCARY,’ ‘CHALLENGING’ TO BE CALLED A ROLE MODEL DURING TEEN FAME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For two years after it happened, I wouldn’t really stay there. Then I got into a relationship and because that person was there with me, I was less scared. But I don’t really like being there on my own that much.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While attending an event for Kitten Rescue LA years later, Cosgrove recalled meeting the woman who was mistakenly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;targeted by the stalker.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This girl came up to me, and she was like, ‘I didn’t know if I should tell you this here or how to say this, but I’m actually the girl that was at your house that got shot at,&apos;&quot; Cosgrove told Bustle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She seemed like she processes things in a similar way that I do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosgrove told Bustle she still enjoyed watching Richard Gadd&apos;s hit Netflix show &quot;Baby Reindeer,&quot; which is based on his own real-life ordeal with a stalker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I didn’t think about it very much,&quot; she said, referring to the 2016 incident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosgrove praised Gadd for being able to dramatize his traumatic experiences on screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I feel like if that were me, having to go back through your most terrible experiences and then try to act them [out], that’d be so hard,&quot; Cosgrove told Bustle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After turning 30, Cosgrove told Bustle a &quot;huge goal&quot; for her was &quot;to find a place that I feel really safe, to kind of start a new chapter.&quot; However, Cosgrove said she has yet to find it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosgrove previously opened up about her experience with the stalker during a 2020 appearance on Whitney Cummings’ &quot;Good For You&quot; podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Daytime &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/emmys&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Emmy Award&lt;/a&gt; winner recalled that she decided to spend the night at her parents&apos; home after a bad date when the police called at 3 a.m. to inform her someone had died at her house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was the weirdest thing ever because they had caution tape up. It was right in my front yard,&quot; Cosgrove recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Basically, I guess a guy came and he was burying things in my backyard for three days. He buried a lunchbox with milk chocolate inside of it in my backyard, and then he buried knives and a rope and a bunch of random stuff.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The actress &lt;/a&gt;noted that she hadn&apos;t noticed the man in her yard while she was there. She later learned the stalker had been pacing around her yard with a gun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After checking her security cameras, she and the police discovered the man had been waiting around on her property for six hours before killing himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And then somebody drove up that had a similar car that kind of looks like my car and I guess he got confused, and he thought that maybe it was me driving up,&quot; she said, referring to the woman who she later met. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He shot at this person six times, and he missed because she was in a car. She drove away.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/child-star-exposes-alleged-nickelodeon-sex-abuse-in-bombshell-documentary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NICKELODEON FORMER CHILD STAR EXPOSES ALLEGED SEX ABUSE IN BOMBSHELL DOCUMENTARY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosgrove told Cummings police still haven&apos;t determined a motive for the man&apos;s actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It might have just been totally random, like he saw me somewhere, and he followed me home or something like that. But they never figured out exactly why,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It freaked me out really bad,&quot; the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/romantic-comedy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; &quot;Mother of the Bride&quot; star &lt;/a&gt;admitted. &quot;And I started staying, like, back in my parents&apos; house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was really bizarre. I have a fantasy of diving into the story and figuring out exactly why it all happened just because I think it’d be interesting to know who the person was, why they were there and exactly what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don’t know if that’d make it worse or if that’d make it better, but it just seems like it’d be interesting to have more answers.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nearly 40,000 people were in Wildwood, N.J., Saturday for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-supporters-flock-massive-new-jersey-campaign-rally-hear-former-president-speak-amid-ongoing-trials&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Donald Trump campaign rally,&lt;/a&gt; and one of those spectators was arguably the greatest defensive player of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-giants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; legend Lawrence Taylor was spotted at the Jersey Shore rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assemblyman Paul Kanitra from New Jersey’s 10th legislative district saw his &quot;favorite player growing up&quot; at the rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those in attendance got a surprise when Taylor and former Giants teammate Ottis Anderson spoke on stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I grew up a Democrat, and I&apos;ve always been a Democrat, until I met this man right here,&quot; Taylor said to cheers. &quot;Nobody in my family ever will vote for a Democrat again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Baklava_USA/status/1789439603956682932&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW MOMENT ON X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L.T. is widely regarded as the greatest linebacker to ever play. He was a three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year, including in his rookie season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He won &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/super-bowl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;two Super Bowls&lt;/a&gt;, made 10 straight Pro Bowls and was named the MVP of the 1986 season. He also remains the franchise&apos;s all-time sacks leader, which includes his 9½ sacks from his rookie season, before sacks became a stat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This came despite a lavish lifestyle off the field, which resulted in legal troubles after his playing days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many attendees who spoke to Fox News said they believe Trump could flip the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Garden State&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in November, when he hopes to take back the White House for a second term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rod Delaine, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/amazon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Amazon factory&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worker in Staten Island who lives in New Jersey, told Fox News Digital he drove nearly 2½ hours to attend the rally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lions-rookie-says-he-chose-no-0-because-aint-nobody-like-me&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIONS ROOKIE SAYS HE CHOSE NO. 0 BECAUSE &apos;AIN&apos;T NOBODY LIKE ME&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A New Jersey schoolteacher who identified herself as Anna said she was motivated to attend because of the state of the economy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another supporter, who identified himself as Carlos, said he believed the country needed to return to the way things were under the former president. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think this country needs to change. Although, we already know what Trump&apos;s all about. So, that change is just going to come right back to us because that&apos;s what we need,&quot; Carlos said. &quot;We need Trump because I don&apos;t think Biden is just getting the job done right now. Some of it&apos;s his fault. Some of it is probably the people around him. But I think we need Trump back to get this country back to where it needs to be.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Bradford Betz and Emma Colton contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>The Biden administration&amp;apos;s use of the CBP One app for asylum seekers, which it says has made the process more efficient, has become controversial for both immigrant and border security advocates.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A government mobile app for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;migrants seeking asylum&lt;/a&gt; at the southern border has become controversial on both sides of the immigration debate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/border-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.S. Customs and Border Protection&lt;/a&gt; (CBP) says on its website the CBP One app to schedule appointments at points of entry into the U.S. has &quot;increased CBP’s capacity to process migrants more efficiently and orderly while cutting out unscrupulous smugglers who endanger and profit from vulnerable migrants.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International, however, said in a report published this week that the mandatory use of the app for asylum seekers is a &quot;clear violation of international human rights and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/disasters/refugees&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;refugee law.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human rights organization says the app creates &quot;layers of complexity and obstacles to an already challenging process.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-senators-introduce-bill-block-migrants-using-border-patrol-app-id-tsa-checkpoints&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPUBLICAN SENATORS INTRODUCE BILL TO BLOCK MIGRANTS FROM USING BORDER PATROL APP AS ID AT TSA CHECKPOINT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ana Piquer, Americas director at Amnesty International, said in a statement: &quot;The use of the CBP One application conditions entry and access to asylum on appearing at a port of entry with a prior appointment, which is not feasible for some people. While technological innovations could potentially provide for safe transit and more orderly border processes, [programs] like CBP One cannot condition and limit the manner to seek international protection in the United States.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration began to use the CBP One app and expanded its use for asylum seekers to make required scheduled appointments at the border as illegal crossings exploded, and as they prepared to end Title 42 a year ago, according to the Los Angeles Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-administrations-cbp-one-app-to-manage-migration-plagued-low-store-ratings-tech-issues&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN ADMINISTRATION&apos;S CBP ONE APP TO MANAGE MIGRATION PLAGUED BY LOW STORE RATINGS, TECH ISSUES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app had actually been conceived near the end of the Trump administration as a way to expedite border crossings for people with the legal right to enter the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the app is equally unpopular with conservatives, who say it encourages migrants to seek asylum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last fall, the House Committee on Homeland Security wrote of the &quot;shocking abuse&quot; of the app, saying that 95.8% of all &quot;inadmissible aliens who scheduled appointments through the app&quot; between January and September last year were ultimately given a &quot;notice to appear&quot; and let into the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[Homeland Security] Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas has utterly abused the CBP One app in his quest for open borders,&quot; committee Chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn., said in a statement. &quot;These numbers are proof that Mayorkas’ operation is a smokescreen for the mass release of individuals into this country who would otherwise have zero claim to be admitted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At a time when global tensions are rising, and our enemies are growing bolder, releasing tens of thousands of these people into our communities — especially when they have not received adequate, if any, vetting — is irresponsible. It shouldn’t take a subpoena threat from Congress to get these answers, but we are going to keep fighting for the truth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government argues the app allows border agents to focus on other border security issues and that it discourages crossing illegally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can highlight a number of instances over the last 10 years, where migrants showing up at our ports of entry without any advance information quickly overwhelm our teams,&quot; Diane Sabatino, acting executive assistant commissioner of CBP’s office of field operations told Congress in March, according to the Los Angeles Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CBP and the White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Promoter offering multimillion-dollar VIP package for Mike Tyson-Jake Paul fight</title>
                    
                    <description>Boxing fans who want to watch the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul bout in person are anxious to get their hands on tickets, but it will come at a steep price.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Legendary heavyweight boxer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/boxing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mike Tyson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will make his highly anticipated return to the ring later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans who want to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/boxing-legend-mike-tyson-face-off-against-jake-paul-july-bout-i-plan-finish-him&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the July 20 bout&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against YouTube star-turned-boxer Jake Paul from inside AT&amp;amp;T Stadium in suburban Dallas will likely have to pay a hefty price for tickets. As the fight draws closer, Paul&apos;s Most Valuable Promotions is offering premium ticket packages for fans who want to take their experience to the next level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VIP packages will start at around $2 million, but they promise to offer buyers unprecedented access to the bout and the events leading up to the highly anticipated event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VIPs will have a pair of ringside apron seats, the promotion said. MVP says no other ticket package for a boxing event has previously offered this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MVP added that more than 100,000 people have signed up for access to presale tickets for the bout. Nakisa Bidarian, co-founder of MVP, said an estimated 10,000 people have expressed interest in the VIP offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-boxing-match-officially-sanctioned-count-professional-records&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIKE TYSON VS. JAKE PAUL BOXING MATCH OFFICIALLY SANCTIONED, WILL COUNT FOR PROFESSIONAL RECORDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VIP package also includes four first-row floor seats for the event and four second-row floor seats. Ticketholders can also head to the locker room for a pre-fight photo with Paul and Tyson. But the VIP experience doesn&apos;t stop there. The package includes gloves signed by both fighters and a two-night stay in a hotel penthouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seven-figure price covers all food and beverages at the event. It also comes with a spot on stage for the weigh-in and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a once-in-a-lifetime event that literally touches six generations,&quot; Bidarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T Stadium, home of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/dallas-cowboys&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt;, seats 80,000 for NFL games, but can expand to accommodate up to 100,000 for other events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyson, once known as &quot;the baddest man on the planet,&quot; turns 58 a few weeks before the fight. Paul turned 27 earlier this year and has a 9-1 record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyson has not &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mike-tyson-shares-first-person-training-clip-he-prepares-jake-paul&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;fought competitively&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; since his TKO loss to Kevin McBride in 2005. He did compete in an exhibition match with Roy Jones Jr. in July 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyson, the youngest boxer in history to win a heavyweight title, released a statement in March saying he was excited about &quot;stepping into the ring&quot; to face Paul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m very much looking forward to stepping into the ring with Jake Paul at the AT&amp;amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas,&quot; Tyson said. &quot;He&apos;s grown significantly as a boxer over the years, so it will be a lot of fun to see what the will and ambition of a &apos;kid&apos; can do with the experience and aptitude of a GOAT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s a full-circle moment that will be beyond thrilling to watch as I started him off on his boxing journey on the undercard of my fight with Roy Jones, and now I plan to finish him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix will stream the fight on July 20 and offer the event to all subscribers at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Top MLB prospect Paul Skenes was under pressure in the days leading up to his big league debut at PNC Park, but the LSU product benefited from a support system.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pitcher Paul Skenes was the first player selected in last year&apos;s MLB Draft. After beginning the 2024 season in the minors pitching for the Pittsburgh Pirates&apos; Triple-A affiliate, he recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/pirates-call-up-top-prospect-paul-skenes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;got the call&lt;/a&gt; to join the big league club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skenes earned a spot with the Pirates after he put together a string of strong performances at the minor league level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 21-year-old&apos;s solid pitching continued during his MLB debut. He struck out seven &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/chicago-cubs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt; batters in four innings Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skenes, who has been dating gymnast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/olivia-dunne-fires-back-question-whether-her-lsu-teammates-like-her&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Olivia Dunne&lt;/a&gt;, credits the LSU gymnastics star for supporting him amid the pressure he faced leading up to his long-awaited debut on an MLB mound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/olivia-dunne-reveals-how-she-boyfriend-paul-skenes-found-out-about-pirates-call-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OLIVIA DUNNE REVEALS HOW SHE AND BOYFRIEND PAUL SKENES FOUND OUT ABOUT PIRATES CALL-UP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s been great. She’s helped me in a lot of ways in terms of managing all the hype, I guess, if you will, and how to manage everything that goes around being a pro athlete because she’s kinda lived it. So, it’s been great,&quot; Skenes said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/MLBNetwork/status/1789060815254966759&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW MOMENT ON X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skenes also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/lsu-tigers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;attended LSU&lt;/a&gt; and was named the Most Outstanding Player after the Tigers won the College World Series in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunne has also starred in her sport, earning SEC Gymnast of the Week honors earlier this season.

She has an estimated name, image and likeness (NIL) value of $3.7 million, according to data complied &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.on3.com/nil/news/lsu-tigers-gymnast-livvy-dunne-signs-multi-million-dollar-nil-deal-with-passes/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;by On3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weather forced Cubs and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/pittsburgh-pirates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Pirates players&lt;/a&gt; to exit the field at the top of the fifth inning.

                    <title>Trump says son Barron, 18, likes politics and gives him advice: ‘He’s a smart one’</title>
                    
                    <description>Former President Trump revealed on Friday that his 18-year-old son, Barron, likes politics and sometimes tries to give him policy advice.</description>

He’s a little on the tall side. I will tell you, he’s a tall one. But he’s a good-looking guy, and he’s really been a great student and he does like politics.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-permitted-attend-son-barrons-graduation-after-ripping-trial-judge-delaying-decision&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP PERMITTED TO ATTEND SON BARRON&apos;S GRADUATION AFTER RIPPING TRIAL JUDGE FOR DELAYING DECISION &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that Barron, who will be able to vote for the first time this year after turning 18 in March, likes to give him political advice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s sort of funny, he’ll tell me sometimes, ‘Dad, this is what you have to do.’ So anyway, he’s a good guy. He’s a senior now in high school, and he’ll be going to college.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/chelsea-clinton-defends-barron-trump-being-targeted-media-unimpeachable-right-privacy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHELSEA CLINTON DEFENDS BARRON TRUMP FROM BEING TARGETED IN THE MEDIA:  ‘UNIMPEACHABLE RIGHT TO PRIVACY’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 18-year-old had been selected as a delegate by the Florida Republican Party to the Republican National Convention, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barron-trump-declines-serve-florida-delegate-rnc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;declined it&lt;/a&gt; in a statement through his mother, Melania Trump’s office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While Barron is honored to have been chosen as a delegate by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/republicans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Florida Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;, he regretfully declines to participate due to prior commitments,&quot; the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republican National Convention is scheduled from July 15 through July 18 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/wisconsin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Milwaukee, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His older children Eric, who is delegation chair, along with Donald Jr., his fiancée Kimberly Guilfoyle, Tiffany and her husband, Michael Boulos, will serve as Florida delegates, according to The Hill. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Top MLB pitching prospect Paul Skenes dazzles in MLB debut</title>
                    
                    <description>Paul Skenes made one of the most highly anticipated debuts in recent memory, and he showed why he was the first pick of last year&amp;apos;s MLB Draft.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Paul Skenes&lt;/a&gt; showed why he is the top pitching prospect in all of baseball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/pittsburgh-pirates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; took the right-handed pitcher with the first overall pick of last year&apos;s MLB Draft after he starred as the ace of the College World Series champion LSU Tigers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skenes started the year in Triple-A and dominated with a 0.99 ERA in seven starts, earning a call to the big leagues earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/olivia-dunne-boyfriend-paul-skenes-mlb-debut-there-is-nothing-that-can-top-this&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OLIVIA DUNNE ON BOYFRIEND PAUL SKENES&apos; MLB DEBUT: &apos;THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN TOP THIS&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After striking out 45 batters in 27⅓ innings in the minors, he showed there was more where that came from, striking out the first two batters he faced, Mike Tauchman and Seiya Suzuki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skenes topped out at 102 mph with breaking stuff in his four-plus innings of work. He threw a season-high 84 pitches while striking out seven, walking two and allowing six hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He allowed a solo home run in the fourth inning to Nico Hoerner that scraped the outfield wall and was yanked after allowing the first two batters to reach base in the fifth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that point, the homer was the only run he allowed, but after Kyle Nicolas threw 13 straight balls, he walked in the two runners Skenes had put on base, giving Skenes three earned runs instead of one and inflating his ERA from 2.25 to 6.75. But Skenes&apos; talent was apparent with his arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Cubs tied the game at six in the fifth, the tarp came out. At the time of publishing, the game was still in a rain delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skenes wore a patch on his jersey that represented the game was his MLB debut. It will now be placed in a random rookie card and has a chance to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/sports/pirates-paul-skenes-mlb-debut-jersey-patch-to-be-placed-in-rookie-card-leading-to-possible-six-figure-sale&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;auctioned off for over six figures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His girlfriend, Olivia Dunne, was in attendance and could hardly contain her excitement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have so many amazing memories with him, but I know how hard he’s worked for this moment. All the hours, I just know what a hard worker he is. This is probably one of my favorite moments I’ve ever seen. Seriously, there is nothing that can top this. I’m just so proud,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Historic geomagnetic conditions made the night sky light up across America Friday night with spectacular displays in all corners of the country.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Historic geomagnetic storms made for a beautiful display in night skies across America Friday night, with the aurora visible as far &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;south as Florida&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, confirmed the geomagnetic storms hit an &quot;extreme&quot; level 5 condition Friday. NOAA also reported there is no sign of these historic storm conditions slowing down until Sunday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxweather.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;FOX Weather&lt;/a&gt; reported the cause of these storms is &quot;a massive sunspot the width of 17 Earths.&quot; The scientific term to describe the phenomenon is known as a coronal mass ejection or a CME. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/millions-people-oklahoma-southern-kansas-risk-tornadoes-severe-thunderstorms&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS OKLAHOMA, SOUTHERN KANSAS AT RISK OF TORNADOES AND SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viewers from across the nation, from Washington to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/missouri&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Missouri, enjoyed the aurora&lt;/a&gt; display Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One social media user wrote, &quot;I have ALWAYS wanted to go and see the northern lights! This is so awesome!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, NOAA Operations Chief Mike Bettwy remarked, &quot;This was certainly quite historic in many ways, because we had not only a lot of intense auroras, but it also happens pretty far south into low latitudes, which we don&apos;t normally see very often, even down to South Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was pretty impressive displays all the way down to Fort Lauderdale, even parts of Puerto Rico. In fact, we got a report just moments ago about some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/hawaii&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sightings in Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All hope is not lost for those who missed the Friday night lights; another display is predicted for Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are expecting a resurgence in the storming later tomorrow and into tomorrow night,&quot; Bettwy added. &quot;So, the display tomorrow night could be as close, quite close to what we saw last night as far as how widespread it is. The color show and how vibrant it is. Looks like it&apos;s going to be quite good again tomorrow night.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photos from all over America shared with Fox News Digital showed the historic meteorological event, from Maine to Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

may not be helpful in reducing burnout in health care, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research indicated that increased time spent using electronic health record (EHR) systems and handling administrative responsibilities has been a burden on doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So some people had heralded artificial intelligence as a potential solution — yet recent investigations by U.S. health systems found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/chatgpt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;large language models (LLMs)&lt;/a&gt; did not simplify clinicians’ day-to-day responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/tech/what-is-ai-artificial-intelligence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a 2023 observational study at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, examined the impact of using AI for electronic patient messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers prompted a large language model to respond to simulated questions from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; — then compared its output to responses from six board-certified radiation oncologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals then edited the AI-generated responses into &quot;clinically acceptable&quot; answers to send to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in The Lancet Digital Health, found that the LLM drafts posed &quot;a risk of severe harm in 11 of 156 survey responses, and death in one survey response.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The majority of harmful responses were due to incorrectly determining or conveying the acuity of the scenario and recommended action,&quot; the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/first-augmented-reality-abdominal-surgery-performed-chile-revolution&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST-EVER AUGMENTED REALITY ABDOMINAL SURGERY PERFORMED IN CHILE: ‘A REVOLUTION’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded that LLM-assisted results (those edited by physicians) displayed a &quot;best-of-both-worlds scenario&quot; — reducing physician workload while ensuring that patients get accurate information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These early findings … indicate the need to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in their intended clinical contexts, reflecting the precise task and level of human oversight,&quot; the study concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study from New York’s Mount Sinai Health System evaluated&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;four different types of large language models for performance and error patterns when querying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/medical-tech&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;medical billing codes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/google-bard-transitions-gemini-what-know-ai-upgrade&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;GOOGLE BARD TRANSITIONS TO GEMINI: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE AI UPGRADE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in the journal NEJM AI, found that all tested LLMs performed poorly on medical code querying, &quot;often generating codes conveying imprecise or fabricated information.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study concluded, &quot;LLMs are not appropriate for use on medical coding tasks without additional research.&quot; The study was funded by the AGA Research Foundation and National Institutes of Health (NIH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers noted that although these models can &quot;approximate the meaning of many codes,&quot; they also &quot;display an unacceptable lack of precision and a high propensity for falsifying codes.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This has significant implications for billing, clinical decision-making, quality improvement, research and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;health policy&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third JAMA Network-published study, from the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, evaluated AI-drafted replies to patient messages and physicians&apos; time spent editing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/chatgpt-found-study-spread-inaccuracies-when-answering-medication-questions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHATGPT FOUND BY STUDY TO SPREAD INACCURACIES WHEN ANSWERING MEDICATION QUESTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assumption was that generative AI drafts would lessen a physician&apos;s time spent doing these tasks — yet the results showed otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Generative AI-drafted replies were associated with significantly increased read time, no change in reply time, significantly increased reply length and [only] some perceived benefits,&quot; the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers suggested that &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;rigorous empirical tests&lt;/a&gt;&quot; are needed to further assess AI’s performance and patients&apos; experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Atashroo, M.D., chief medical officer of Qventus, an AI-powered surgical management solution in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mountain View, California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; reacted to the research findings in an interview with Fox News Digital. (He was not involved in the research.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We see an immense potential for AI to take on lower-risk, yet highly automatable tasks that traditionally fall on the essential yet often overlooked ‘glue roles’ in health care — such as schedulers, medical assistants, case managers and care navigators,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These professionals are crucial in holding together processes that are directly tied to clinical outcomes, yet spend a substantial portion of their time on administrative tasks like parsing faxes, summarizing notes and securing necessary documentation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In automating these tasks, Atashroo suggested that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/artificial-intelligence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;generative AI&lt;/a&gt; could help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When considering the deployment of generative AI, it&apos;s crucial to set realistic expectations about its performance,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The standard cannot always be perfection, as even the humans currently performing these tasks are not infallible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some scenarios, he suggested, AI could help serve as a &quot;safety net&quot; to catch any oversights of team members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tasks may sometimes go unaddressed &quot;simply because there isn&apos;t enough time to tackle them,&quot; Atashroo noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Generative AI can help manage cases more consistently than our current capacity allows.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety and efficacy are &quot;paramount&quot; in AI applications, the doctor also noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This means not only developing models with rigorous quality checks, but also incorporating regular assessments by human experts to validate their performance,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This dual-layer verification ensures that our AI solutions are both responsible and reliable before they are scaled.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atashroo also noted that &quot;transparency in the development and implementation of AI technologies is essential in building trust among hospital partners and patients.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews/health&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Infusing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;more olive oil&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into your diet could pay big dividends for cognitive health and longevity, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and other universities analyzed population health data for more than 92,000 adults over a 28-year period. The participants’ average age was 56 and none of them had heart disease or cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that people who consumed over 7 grams a day of olive oil had a 28% lower risk of dementia-related death compared to those who rarely or never consumed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/eating-popular-fruit-could-help-reduce-chances-dementia-study-finds&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;EATING ONE POPULAR FRUIT COULD HELP REDUCE YOUR CHANCES OF DEVELOPING DEMENTIA, STUDY FINDS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the case regardless of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/nutrition&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;quality of the person’s diet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dietary data was gathered from questionnaires; people reported their frequency of olive oil consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers then compared that to the rate of dementia death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Substituting olive oil intake for margarine and mayonnaise was associated with lower risk of dementia mortality and may be a potential strategy to improve longevity free of dementia,&quot; the researchers wrote in the study findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/8-best-fruits-health-nutritionists&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;THESE ARE THE 8 BEST FRUITS FOR YOUR HEALTH, ACCORDING TO NUTRITIONISTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These findings extend the current dietary recommendations of choosing olive oil and other vegetable oils to the context of cognitive health and related mortality.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of consuming olive oil come from its antioxidant properties, according to Lindsay Allan, registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Back in Balance Nutrition, LLC, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tampa Bay, Florida&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allan was not involved in the Harvard study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oxidative stress is one of the main root causes of disease — this is why we always talk about consuming plenty of antioxidant-rich foods that have the capability to ‘quench’ those free radicals or ‘oxidants’ that are causing damage to our cells,&quot; she told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Extra virgin olive oil is one of those foods that are super high in phenolic compounds, which act as potent antioxidants in the body,&quot; she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/mediterranean-mind-diets-shown-reduce-signs-alzheimers-brain-study-finds&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MEDITERRANEAN, MIND DIETS SHOWN TO REDUCE SIGNS OF ALZHEIMER’S IN THE BRAIN, STUDY FINDS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So it makes sense that consuming olive oil frequently — as opposed to those highly oxidized, processed seed oils that we find all over grocery stores — would mitigate the damage to the neurons caused by oxidative stress.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanya Freirich, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Charlotte, North Carolina, who practices as The Lupus Dietitian, was not involved in the study but commented on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;health benefits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Olive oil is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, a nutritious fat that many people don&apos;t consume enough of,&quot; she told Fox News Digital.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A higher omega-3 intake is known to reduce dementia and cognitive decline. It&apos;s great to see the association between consuming olive oil, a great source of omega 3s, and a reduced risk of dementia.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts from the Alzheimer’s Association noted that the study had &quot;significant limitations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This study looked at people’s health records, death records, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/diet-trends&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;diet, and food frequency &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;questionnaires to try to identify possible connections between specific food intake and risk of dementia-related death,&quot; noted Rebecca M. Edelmayer, PhD, senior director of scientific engagement at the Alzheimer’s Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is not an intervention study where some people ate olive oil and some didn’t — which is the ‘gold standard’ for the way a treatment clinical trial is conducted. That means this study can show an association or connection between two things, but can’t prove cause and effect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edelmayer also noted that death records may not be a reliable determination of dementia mortality, because dementia and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health/alzheimers&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are often &quot;underreported&quot; as a cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a need for studies among wider populations, Edelmayer added, as this one mainly focused on non-Hispanic White people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is good, quality evidence that consuming more olive oil and similar vegetable oils and less animal fats has health benefits, in particular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;heart health benefits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It would be wonderful if a particular food could delay or prevent Alzheimer’s disease, but we do not have scientific evidence that these claims are true. We need randomized controlled clinical trials to evaluate whether any foods have a scientifically proven beneficial effect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts agree that a multitude of factors come into play when assessing dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In addition to olive oil intake, people should still aim to exercise regularly, keep up with hobbies that stimulate their mind, and consume other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;healthy foods&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the most protection against developing dementia,&quot; Frierich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/alzheimers-risk-reduced-women-follow-dash-diet-40s-study-finds&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ALZHEIMER’S RISK IS REDUCED AMONG WOMEN WHO FOLLOW THE DASH DIET IN THEIR 40S, STUDY FINDS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Additionally, other habits like smoking and alcohol use or health conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease and high cholesterol can contribute to the development of dementia.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to maintain regularly scheduled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/health-care&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;doctors&apos; appointments&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to manage other health risks, according to the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the study authors for additional comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews/health&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Olivia Dunne on boyfriend Paul Skenes&apos; MLB debut: &apos;There is nothing that can top this&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Paul Skenes made his MLB debut Saturday, and Olivia Dunne couldn&amp;apos;t contain her excitement when speaking to the Pirates&amp;apos; television network.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/pittsburgh-pirates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; called up top prospect Paul Skenes Saturday, and he made his MLB debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a quick call-up for Skenes, who was the first overall pick of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2023 MLB Draft&lt;/a&gt; after he starred as the ace of the College World Series champion LSU Tigers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skenes&apos; loved ones took in the game in a suite at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, and his girlfriend, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/lsu-tigers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;LSU gymnast and social media star Olivia Dunne&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the many in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trevor-bauer-posts-micd-up-video-immaculate-inning-mexican-league&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TREVOR BAUER POSTS MIC&apos;D UP VIDEO OF IMMACULATE INNING IN MEXICAN LEAGUE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the bottom of the third, when Skenes was in the dugout, Dunne &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TalkinBaseball_/status/1789399776548573455&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;spoke to the Pirates&apos; broadcast&lt;/a&gt; full of excitement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have so many amazing memories with him, but I know how hard he’s worked for this moment. All the hours, I just know what a hard worker he is. This is probably one of my favorite moments I’ve ever seen. Seriously, there is nothing that can top this. I’m just so proud,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunne said she and Skenes were napping together when they woke up to &quot;a few missed calls.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That’s the quickest I’ve ever packed in my life. We just woke up from a nap. He had a few missed calls, and he got called up. And he just said, ‘Let’s pack,’ and we hit the road. It was so exciting,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The support here is awesome. Pittsburgh has been so welcoming. … The support here is unreal, and I love it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skenes mowed down the competition at Triple-A with a 0.99 ERA over his first seven starts. He gave up just 17 hits while consistently clocking in at over 100 mph. He struck out 45 batters while walking eight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittsburgh gave him a record $9.2 million signing bonus when he inked his first contract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skenes struck out the first two batters he faced, topping out at 102 mph in the first inning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Scott Thompson contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

He is in the custody of Bronx Special Victims. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of May 5, there were 511 rapes reported in New York City, the same total as last year over the same period, according to NYPD data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Michael Ruiz contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Legendary college football coach Urban Meyer likens NIL to &apos;cheating&apos;: &apos;That&apos;s not what the intent is&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Urban Meyer stopped coaching before the NIL era began, and he argues that, under the current system, it&amp;apos;s a form of &amp;quot;cheating&amp;quot; in college athletics.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-fb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Urban Meyer&lt;/a&gt; to the list of legends to rip the current state of NIL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/college-football-bowl-season&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;three-time national champion football coach&lt;/a&gt; said name, image and likeness has become a form of &quot;cheating&quot; when recruiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you&apos;re a woman basketball player like the great girl from Iowa, and they want to put her on a billboard and pay her, they should be able to do that. But that&apos;s not what happened,&quot; Meyer said during an interview with Lou Holtz. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What&apos;s happened is the arms race of collecting money from donors, and the donors are simply paying players. That&apos;s what I understand is happening, and I don&apos;t like that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If Lou Holtz or Urban Meyer or Marvin Harrison Jr., or C.J. Stroud, they want to go use their name and help sell cars, help a business, that&apos;s great. But to have a 17-year-old demand money for a visit, to pay these players a lot of money to go visit a charity for 20 minutes, and they write you a check for $50,000. That&apos;s cheating. That&apos;s not what this is all about. I&apos;m very disappointed in where it went.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meyer got out of coaching six years ago, and NIL was still somewhat unimaginable when he walked away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/illinois-star-nba-prospect-terrence-shannon-jr-ordered-face-trial-rape-charge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ILLINOIS STAR, NBA PROSPECT TERRENCE SHANNON JR. ORDERED TO FACE TRIAL ON RAPE CHARGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meyer even argued NIL is &quot;great,&quot; but once it became &quot;capitalism,&quot; that&apos;s where he has issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&apos;s these things called collectives where they go out and get money from donors and get this big, giant mass of money and they pay players,&quot; Meyer said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the intent is.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meyer coached &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/ohio-state-buckeyes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ohio State&lt;/a&gt; from 2012 to 2018 after leading the Florida Gators from 2005 to 2010. He last coached the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2021 but was fired after a 2-11 start to the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mystik Dan, the winner of the 150th running of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/150th-kentucky-derby-winner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kentucky Derby,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will keep alive the chance of seeing another Triple Crown winner after trainer Kenny McPeek confirmed Saturday that the three-year-old colt will race in the Preakness Stakes next weekend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McPeek Racing made the announcement a week from the 149th running of the second leg of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/horse-racing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Triple Crown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which takes place at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore on May 18. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mystik Dan is well and acts like he&apos;ll be ready to run in the Preakness. I&apos;ve discussed the decision with owners Lance Gasaway, Daniel Hamby, Brent Gasaway and Scot Hamby, and we plan to run May 18th,&quot; McPeek said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The colt&apos;s had a good week. He will travel to Baltimore Sunday.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McPeek also confirmed that jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. will ride Mystik Dan in the race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He didn&apos;t win the Derby without the job Brian did. I&apos;m thrilled Brian is finally getting the credit he deserves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/jason-kelce-walks-back-claim-that-triple-crown-winning-horse-secretariat-was-on-steroids&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;JASON KELCE WALKS BACK STEROID CLAIM ABOUT TRIPLE CROWN WINNER: &apos;WASN&apos;T TRYING TO GET PEOPLE RILED UP&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mystik Dan won the Kentucky Derby in true photo-finish fashion. It was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose — the closest margin in horse racing — and the first since 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McPeek last won the Preakness in 2020 with filly Swiss Skydiver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last Triple Crown winner, Justify, was trained by Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
