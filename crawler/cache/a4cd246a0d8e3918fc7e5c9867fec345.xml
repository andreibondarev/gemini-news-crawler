                    <title>Police bust finds over 700 pounds of drugs inside Transformers statues</title>
                    
                    <description>The drugs originated in Cambodia and traveled through Thailand, intended for sale in more luxurious markets in neighboring areas such as Australia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Thailand authorities made a startling discovery when they busted open lifesize Transformer robot statues and retrieved over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/elon-musk-reveals-takes-ketamine-denies-abusing-drug-should-keep-taking-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;700 pounds of ketamine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Currently, we are facing a drug trafficking problem with transnational crime networks hidden in all regions, using Thailand as a base to smuggle drugs to third countries continuously through international shipments via air or sea,&quot; Police Lt. Gen. Phanurat Lhakbun told reporters of the bust, which happened on April 25. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australian authorities found around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-kentucky-prosecutor-accused-trading-favors-meth-sex-pleads-guilty&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;220 pounds of methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt; that an unidentified woman tried to smuggle inside a food processing machine on March 12, and they kept an eye on her activities in the following weeks, Viral Press reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She allegedly tried to smuggle an even bigger batch of drugs inside the bases of lifesize statues of the Transformers characters Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Greenlight and others. The statues ostensibly were to go to a movie exhibition in Taiwan, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cna.com.tw/news/asoc/202404260196.aspx&quot;&gt;Channel News Asia reported&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/thailands-prime-minister-moves-outlaw-marijuana-2-years-decriminalization&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;THAILAND&apos;S PRIME MINISTER MOVES TO OUTLAW MARIJUANA 2 YEARS AFTER ITS DECRIMINALIZATION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman allegedly paid around $4,800 to the shipping company to help her transport the statues. Authorities said she had received instructions from another unidentified woman in Laos who would receive the drugs. The narcotics board claimed that the drugs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/asia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;originated in Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;, and they have agents working to track down any accomplices in Taiwan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6352598469112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FOUR FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ACCUSED OF USING TSA CLEARANCE TO SMUGGLE DRUG MONEY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The ONCB has cooperation projects with the Airport Interdiction Task Force to suppress and intercept drugs in airports and the Seaport Interdiction Task Force for intercepting drug imports to the inner part of the country and exports to third countries,&quot; Phanurat said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/virginia-first-lady-ag-team-recovering-addict-launch-initiatives-targeting-states-fentanyl-crisis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIRGINIA FIRST LADY, AG TEAM WITH RECOVERING ADDICT TO LAUNCH INITIATIVES TARGETING STATE&apos;S FENTANYL CRISIS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thai authorities have intercepted more than four tons of crystal meth, two tons of ketamine and over 580 pounds of heroin in busts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The narcotics board claimed that the drugs would otherwise end up in lucrative markets in nearby areas of Australia, Taiwan, Malaysia and Hong Kong, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsflare.com/video/642559/police-seize-320kg-of-ketamine-hidden-inside-life-size-transformer-robots&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Newsflare reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Netanyahu’s legacy could be ‘a break’ in relationship between US and Israel, Democratic senator says</title>
                    
                    <description>Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be thinking about his legacy after vowing to eliminate Hamas.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The legacy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be at a crossroads, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said Sunday, as Israel looks to launch a direct assault on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hamas stronghold&lt;/a&gt; of Rafah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coons appeared on ABC’s &quot;This Week&quot; and said he hopes Netanyahu is thinking about his legacy after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt; threatened to withhold offensive aid from Israel should the Jewish state go forward with a ground invasion on Rafah, where millions of Palestinian civilians are sheltering from the war. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Right now, his legacy is the huge strategic and defensive failure of Oct. 7,&quot; Coons said of Netanyahu. &quot;And his legacy could be a real gap, a break in the long, strong bipartisan strategic relationship between the United States and Israel.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coons continued that this outcome &quot;would be tragic,&quot; and highlighted a different path for Netanyahu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-senate-democrat-joins-growing-chorus-lawmakers-breaking-biden-israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP SENATE DEMOCRAT JOINS GROWING CHORUS OF LAWMAKERS BREAKING FROM BIDEN ON ISRAEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[Netanyahu’s] legacy could instead be achieving regional security and peace for Israel,&quot; the senator said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/benjamin-netanyahu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Netanyahu has vowed&lt;/a&gt; to follow through with the eradication of Hamas – even if it loses Israel its allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have told our American friends: If necessary, we will fight with our fingernails,&quot; Netanyahu said Sunday, addressing those who will carry torches on Israel&apos;s 76th Independence Day. &quot;We have much more than fingernails.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/netanyahu-bidens-vows-withhold-weapons-israel-would-result-civilian-casualties&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NETANYAHU SAYS BIDEN&apos;S VOW TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FRO9M ISRAEL WOULD RESULT IN CIVILIAN CASUALTIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coons said that while the U.S. will continue to provide defensive systems to Israel, the U.S. will be watching Netanyahu’s next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think we&apos;ll be looking closely at the path forward that Prime Minister Netanyahu chooses in the days ahead, whether he will use American supplied munitions to bomb and invade and attack Rafah, and the million civilians who are there in order to get at the Hamas fighters who are buried in tunnels deep beneath Rafah,&quot; Coons said. &quot;Or whether he will move ahead with allowing those civilians to be relocated in accordance with a plan developed with the United States.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coons said the latter plan isn’t &quot;fully acceptable&quot; to the U.S. yet, or his preferred outcome, as officials work to prepare a deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia that will allow a cease-fire, hostage release and resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, and long-term security for Israel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;against Iran.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

His agent says that he had previously been in the ICU, although no cause of death was given. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

In fact, the first time my wife ever saw me do standup was at the Ice House on Rudy&apos;s show. All this ultimately led to me doing my Netflix special at the Ice House, thanks to Rudy Moreno constantly supporting me and letting me get stage time on all of his shows. There are countless comedians who owe their start to this man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreno was a frequent performer at the Ice House Comedy Club in Pasadena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is survived by his wife Arlene, their two children and several grandchildren. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The two women were also the subjects of some jokes as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moynahan responded with a cryptic post of her own after the roast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/julian-edelman-recalls-tense-backstage-moment-between-robert-kraft-bill-belichick-at-tom-bradys-roast&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JULIAN EDELMAN RECALLS TENSE BACKSTAGE MOMENT BETWEEN ROBERT KRAFT, BILL BELICHICK AT TOM BRADY&apos;S ROAST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Loyal people take s--- more personal because they never would’ve did that s--- to you,&quot; her post read last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://people.com/gisele-bundchen-deeply-disappointed-by-jokes-about-marriage-tom-brady-source-exclusive-8644399&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;People reported&lt;/a&gt; Bündchen was left &quot;deeply disappointed&quot; with the jokes hurled at her during the roast and that their two children were &quot;affected.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brady reportedly apologized to Bündchen over the jokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comedian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/comedian-nikki-glaser-awkward-interaction-tom-brady-roast-he-was-out-of-there&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Nikki Glaser&lt;/a&gt;, who left the audience in stitches with her jokes about Brady’s relationships, told TMZ that she &quot;had to go there&quot; because it was a roast but acknowledged she would apologize if she ever saw her in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Massive Trump beach rally in deep blue NJ draws stark contrast to Biden&apos;s beach weekend: &apos;Biden could never&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Critics on social media argue President Biden could not pull a massive crowd like former President Trump in Wildwood, New Jersey, as they slam the current president for his beach weekend.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Critics of President Biden are lambasting his beach vacation in Delaware, while contrasting the Mother&apos;s Day weekend getaway to former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Trump&apos;s massive rally&lt;/a&gt; in the historically blue state of New Jersey on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Supporters camped out overnight at the beach for a Trump rally that starts at 5PM today in Wildwood. Joe Biden can’t fill up a broom closet without staff, media, and angry protestors,&quot; one X user under the name Bad Hombre posted Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump held a beachside rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, on Saturday evening, where at least 80,000, and up to 100,000 supporters, joined the 45th president in the historically deep blue state. Simultaneously, 24 miles across Deleware Bay, Biden arrived at his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/delaware&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;home in Rehoboth Beach&lt;/a&gt; for Mother’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden’s trip followed&lt;/a&gt; a fundraising event in Seattle, where he was greeted by local leaders such as Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., as well as a group of left-wing, anti-Israel protesters holding signs reading &quot;Traitor Genocide Joe Free Palestine&quot; and &quot;Genocide Joe Must Go,&quot; the Seattle Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-supporters-flock-massive-new-jersey-campaign-rally-hear-former-president-speak-amid-ongoing-trials&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP SUPPORTERS FLOCK TO MASSIVE NEW JERSEY CAMPAIGN RALLY TO HEAR FORMER PRESIDENT SPEAK AMID ONGOING TRIALS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of last fall, Biden was on course to spend about 40% of his presidency on vacation, compared to Trump reportedly spending 26% of his time outside Washington, D.C., when he was in office, and President Barack Obama&apos;s reported 11% of vacation time, the New York Post previously reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media commenters jumped at comparing Trump’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;massive rally on the Jersey Shore&lt;/a&gt; to Biden spending the weekend at his Delaware beach house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Crooked Joe Biden will soon head to his beach house for a weekend of rest. SAD!&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1789366783423480188&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;RNC Research posted on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in response to a video showing the massive crowds at the South Jersey beach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/north-dakota-gov-presidential-candidate-doug-burgum-front-center-trump-new-jersey-rally&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NORTH DAKOTA GOV, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DOUG BURGUM FRONT AND CENTER AT TRUMP NEW JERSEY RALLY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The crowd in Wildwood, NJ keeps growing. People have been camped out and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/beach&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;even slept on the beach&lt;/a&gt;. Trump is not set to speak until 5pm est today. No one would camp out to meet Biden,&quot; X &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ThePoliticalPom/status/1789326068576342144&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;account the Political Pom posted.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-denies-report-nikki-haley-under-consideration-vp-role&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP DENIES REPORT CLAIMING NIKKI HALEY IS ‘UNDER CONSIDERATION’ FOR VP ROLE: ‘I WISH HER WELL!’ &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Meanwhile Biden goes on vacation to the beach in Delaware and not a single person is there to rally for him,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SmashMemez/status/1789418211462500618&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;another X account posted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, alongside video of crowds lining the streets in anticipation of Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;CROOKED JOE BIDEN COULD NEVER,&quot; the Trump War Room posted, alongside beach &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1789365614441570455&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;footage showing the massive crowd&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-supporters-flock-massive-new-jersey-campaign-rally-hear-former-president-speak-amid-ongoing-trials&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP SUPPORTERS FLOCK TO MASSIVE NEW JERSEY CAMPAIGN RALLY TO HEAR FORMER PRESIDENT SPEAK AMID ONGOING TRIALS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Biden ignores questions as he wraps up a day of fundraising – and heads to the beach for a weekend of rest,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1789404669279629680&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;RNC Research posted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PollsNOpinions1/status/1789412173468291306&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Another X account posed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a question for a poll asking: &quot;80,000 people attended a Trump rally in Wildwood, New Jersey. Could Biden ever get this many people to a rally?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/50-cent-rips-biden-delaware-beach-trip-amid-israel-hamas-war&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50 CENT RIPS BIDEN FOR DELAWARE BEACH TRIP AMID ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR: &apos;WE GOT SOME REAL S--- GOING ON&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital spoke on Saturday to Trump rally attendees, who described happily waiting on the beach for the former president and added they foresee big Trump wins in November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think this country needs to change – although, we already know what Trump&apos;s all about,&quot; one supporter who identified himself as Carlos said. &quot;So, that change is just going to come right back to us because that&apos;s what we need. We need Trump because I don&apos;t think Biden is just getting the job done right now. Some of it&apos;s his fault. Some of it is probably the people around him. But I think we need Trump back to get this country back to where it needs to be.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about Trump’s prospects in November, Carlos pointed to the large crowd and said: &quot;Take a look.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There’s probably about six to 7,000 people waiting in line and probably more. [The line] goes all the way back to the entrance. So, you’re looking at 35- to 40,000 people at this venue right now,&quot; he said, noting that some people had been waiting since Thursday for the venue to open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An attendee named Lisa, who traveled from Westcheester County, New York, described herself as a &quot;convert&quot; supporter of Trump despite having come from a long line of liberals in her family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-blasts-house-for-2-week-vacation-despite-facing-criticism-for-his-frequent-beach-trips&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN BLASTS HOUSE FOR TWO-WEEK &apos;VACATION&apos; DESPITE FACING CRITICISM FOR HIS FREQUENT BEACH TRIPS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s just like, something overnight shifted in the culture that I didn&apos;t realize,&quot; she said. &quot;I was taking stuff at face value and the minute the walls came crumbling down, I just started [going] deep into everything.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump was joined by New Jersey Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew, who also left the Democratic Party under the Trump administration for the GOP. He described the Wildwood event as historical for the Garden State. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This has got to be the biggest political rally in the history of New Jersey,&quot; Van Drew told the crowd. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common theme amid the lengthy rally, which wrapped up around 8 p.m., was the argument that Trump will win the historically deep blue state come November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’re going to win New Jersey,&quot; the GOP frontrunner told the crowd to exuberant cheers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6351068111112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIKE HUCKABEE: THE ONLY TIME BIDEN IS WINNING IS ON THE BEACH OR IN HIS BASEMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As you can see today, we’re expanding the electoral map because… we’re going to win the state of New Jersey,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I think we’re going to win them all. All across America, millions of people, so-called blue states, are joining our movement based on love, intelligence, and a thing called common sense.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to New Jerseyans, the rally also drew a large crowd from the key battleground state of Pennsylvania, as well as attendees from deep blue New York and elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump focused on the economy and inflation through much of the event, highlighting that everything from hotdogs to chicken and gasoline had shot up in prices under the Biden administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Biden price hikes are continuing to drain over $1,000 from the typical New Jersey family budget every single month,&quot; Trump said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-says-wasnt-vacation-visiting-home-rehoboth-beach-delaware-cant-go-home-home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN SAYS HE WASN&apos;T ON VACATION WHILE VISITING HOME IN REHOBOTH BEACH, DELAWARE: &apos;I CAN&apos;T GO HOME HOME&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On day one, we will throw out Bidenomics, and we will reinstate MAGAnomics,&quot; he said. &quot;And we’re going to bring manufacturing, tourism, and other industries back to New Jersey like we’ve never seen before.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-says-he-hasnt-been-able-break-east-palestine-visit-despite-lake-tahoe-getaway-de-trips&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN SAYS HE HASN&apos;T ‘BEEN ABLE TO BREAK’ FOR EAST PALESTINE VISIT, DESPITE LAKE TAHOE GETAWAY AND DE TRIPS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump lambasted Biden ​​as a &quot;moron&quot; and the &quot;worst president that we’ve ever had&quot; in comments to the raucous crowd. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;He’s surrendering our college campuses&lt;/a&gt; to anarchists, jihadist freaks and anti-American extremists who are trying to tear down our American flag. They want to tear down every single place they go,&quot; Trump said, before calling on Biden and the Democratic National Committee, &quot;to return the donations of all antisemites, American haters, and financiers of chaos on our campuses.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden campaign referred Fox News Digital to a campaign email titled &quot;&apos;Juggernaut&apos; No More - Trump’s Non-Campaign Peddles Desperate Spin,&quot; when asked about the rally and criticisms Sunday morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Republicans* are begging for support from Trump’s broke campaign,&quot; the email states. &quot;The calls are coming from inside the GOP. We told you the campaign was broke, understaffed, driving moderate voters away, and can’t build the campaign infrastructure necessary to win 270 electoral votes in November. Republicans across battleground states are saying the same exact thing, and sounding the alarm about the prospects of the Trump campaign.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The massive and potentially historic rally in New Jersey comes as Trump continues his trial in New York City, where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records. The former president has denied all charges against him. Trump, who is under a gag order amid the trial, has repeatedly slammed the case as a &quot;scam&quot; promoted by the Biden administration ahead of the general election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Andrew Mark Miller and Bradford Betz contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cms.foxnews.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=6021998&amp;amp;action=edit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Blake Shelton&lt;/a&gt; is going to be a movie star, and it&apos;s all thanks to Mark Wahlberg. But there&apos;s a slight catch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Shelton was honored at the 27th annual Power of Love Gala hosted by Keep Memory Alive, an organization dedicated to brain disorder research and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelton was recognized for his philanthropic efforts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.com/blake-shelton-spends-40k-on-walk-on-movie-role-with-mark-wahlberg-8647118&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;People magazine&lt;/a&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/blake-sheltons-return-the-voice-dependent-dream-scenario&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BLAKE SHELTON&apos;S RETURN TO &apos;THE VOICE&apos; DEPENDENT ON THIS DREAM SCENARIO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event included an enticing life-auction, which Shelton took part in and won. He bid on the opportunity to be in a future &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mark-wahlberg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mark Wahlberg&lt;/a&gt; film as a walk-on role. Shelton shelled out $40,000 for the offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2020, Wahlberg has produced six of his own films in which he&apos;s also starred. According to IMDb, he has several movies in the works. At last year&apos;s event, attendees had the opportunity to win a golf outing with Wahlberg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

They performed their duet, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/music&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Nobody But You&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;His heart is as big as his voice,&quot; Stefani told the audience of her husband, per People. &quot;His talent is obvious and he lights up the room and brings a smile to everyone he meets that makes us all love him so much. So whether he’s supporting an important cause and organizations across the country, he’s an incredible person.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He supports veterans. He supports children’s hospitals, food banks, supports people with disabilities, disaster relief efforts, wildlife conservation or local communities in need, Blake’s generosity is genuine and endless,&quot; she added. &quot;His dedication to giving back and making a difference and using his platform for good, both publicly and behind the scenes is truly inspiring.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the evening, Shelton joked about his potential transition into the movie business. &quot;I don’t know if you guys saw the auction earlier. This is maybe the last time I’m ever gonna perform country music. I’m a movie star now. I’m not f------ around.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The career change would come at an opportune time for Shelton, who recently left his coaching position at &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Voice&lt;/a&gt;&quot; after 23 seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etonline.com/interview-blake-shelton-discusses-possible-return-to-the-voice-and-his-new-bar-exclusive-223673&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Entertainment Tonight&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Shelton reflected on his choice to leave the show, admitting &quot;every day feels a little bit better,&quot; since his departure in 2023. &quot;I feel better about that decision.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Shelton did say there was one scenario that would intrigue him enough to return. &quot;If they were ever able to put together the original four coaches again, maybe [I&apos;d return] for one season, a one-off,&quot; he shared. &quot;That would be fun for me... That would be something I would be interested in doing,&quot; he said of reuniting with CeeLo Green, Christina Aguilera and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/adam-levine-return-the-voice&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adam Levine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Iranian lawmaker declares Tehran obtained nuclear bombs</title>
                    
                    <description>U.S. and UN experts say Iran’s regime is dangerously close to becoming a nuclear-armed weapons state as officials in Tehran announce their capability to build atomic bombs.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After the head of the United Nation’s atomic watchdog agency warned that Iran has enough uranium to produce &quot;several&quot; nuclear bombs, a firebrand Iranian lawmaker declared on Friday that the Islamic Republic of Iran possesses atomic weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In my opinion, we have achieved nuclear weapons, but we do not announce it. It means our policy is to possess nuclear bombs, but our declared policy is currently within the framework of the JCPOA,&quot; Ahmad Bakhshayesh Ardestani told the Iran-based outlet Rouydad 24 on Friday, according to an article published by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iranintl.com/en/202405108870&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;independent news organization Iran International&lt;/a&gt; in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JCPOA is an abbreviation for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the formal name for the Iran nuclear deal. President Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-declares-us-leaving-horrible-iran-nuclear-accord&quot;&gt;withdrew the U.S. from the JCPOA&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 because, his administration argued, the accord did not stop Iran’s drive to build atomic weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The JCPOA provides massive economic sanctions relief to Iran in exchange for assurances it will not, within a limited time period, build a nuclear weapon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/several-countries-come-israels-aid-stop-iran-barrage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEVERAL COUNTRIES COME TO ISRAEL’S AID TO STOP IRAN BARRAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ardestani, who was re-elected to Iran’s quasi-parliament in March, added, &quot;The reason is that when countries want to confront others, their capabilities must be compatible, and Iran&apos;s compatibility with America and Israel means that Iran must have nuclear weapons,&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iranian parliament member noted, &quot;In a climate where Russia has attacked Ukraine and Israel has attacked Gaza, and Iran is a staunch supporter of the Resistance Front, it is natural for the containment system to require that Iran possess nuclear bombs. However, whether Iran declares it is another matter.&quot; Fox News Digital sent press queries to Iran’s Foreign Ministry in Tehran and its U.N. mission in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts on Iran’s illegal nuclear weapons program warned about the seemingly speculative comments made by Ardestani. Jason Brodsky, the policy director of the U.S.-based United Against a Nuclear Iran, told Fox News Digital that &quot;Ardestani is only a member of parliament, and he’s not in the inner core of the regime’s nuclear decision-making circle, so while his comments are interesting, I think they have to be weighed properly given his access and standing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just two days before Ardestani’s announcement, the president of the Iranian Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, Kamal Kharrazi, told Al-Jazeera Network Qatar, &quot;I announced two years ago, in an interview with Al-Jazeera TV, that Iran had the absorptive capacity and the capability to produce a nuclear bomb. Iran still has that capability, but we have not made the decision to produce a nuclear bomb. However, if the Iranian interests are threatened in this manner, we may change this doctrine. The military officials in Iran have announced that if our nuclear facilities would be attacked, we may change our military doctrine, with regard to the nuclear facilities.&quot; The U.S.-based Middle East Media Institute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memri.org/reports/senior-iranian-official-kamal-kharrazi-iran-capable-producing-nuclear-bomb-and-may-decide&quot;&gt;(MEMRI) translated and published&lt;/a&gt; Kharrazi’s May 8 interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/world-leaders-collectively-condemn-irans-reckless-attack-against-israel-support-israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORLD LEADERS COLLECTIVELY CONDEMN IRAN&apos;S &apos;RECKLESS&apos; ATTACK AGAINST ISRAEL: &apos;WE SUPPORT ISRAEL&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brodsky said,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&quot;Kharrazi’s comments are part of an increasingly loud chorus of threats from Iranian officials that they will change Iran’s nuclear doctrine if Israel attacks them. The current advanced state of Iran’s nuclear program provides it with the luxury to make these threats as it hopes to deter Western policymakers from launching pressure campaigns on Tehran.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics of the Biden administration’s Iran policy argue the White House &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/bidens-iran-de-escalation-strategy-backfiring-regime-close-producing-atomic-bomb&quot;&gt;strategy of de-escalation and containment&lt;/a&gt; targeting Iran’s atomic program has backfired. Iran’s regime – the world’s worst state-sponsor of international terrorism – is moving at an astonishingly fast pace to secure an operational nuclear weapon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuclear security alarm bells are ringing over Iran’s illicit atomic program in Europe. Fox News Digital obtained the April intelligence agency report for Germany’s most populous state, Nordrhein-Westfalen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The German intelligence report notes, &quot;The Islamic Republic&apos;s continued intensive procurement efforts by Iran in Germany continues&quot; for its &quot;nuclear and missile program.&quot; The German experts added &quot;proliferation-relevant activities by Iran to circumvent existing sanctions in favor of Iran&apos;s nuclear and missile programs can still be assumed.&quot; A State Department spokesperson previously told Fox News Digital, &quot;As the president and the secretary have made clear, the United States will ensure one way or another that Iran will never obtain a nuclear weapon. We continue to use a variety of tools in pursuit of that goal, and all options remain on the table.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Wurmser, a former senior adviser for nonproliferation and Middle East strategy for former Vice President Dick Cheney, told Fox News Digital, &quot;The distance from where Iran is purported to be to an actual deliverable device is still a ways away, provided the information that we have in our operating from is correct. And that is quite a proviso. We know that North Koreans have been interacting with the Iranians, and we know relations with North Korea go back many, many years.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The communist state of North Korea previously aided Syria in building its illicit nuclear reactor. Israel’s air force knocked out the reactor in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-nuclear-energy-mountain-is-fully-safe-after-israeli-strike-state-media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRAN&apos;S &apos;NUCLEAR ENERGY MOUNTAIN&apos; IS &apos;FULLY SAFE&apos; AFTER ISRAELI STRIKE: STATE MEDIA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wurmser warned, &quot;As since intelligence is generally incomplete and is inherently seeking to discover that which is given to being opaque with much hidden, we have to assume surprises. I realize in the Iraq war we imagined there was more there than there actually was – and there was more than what is popularly understood – but Iraq is actually a very rare circumstance. The Pakistani, the Russian, the Chinese, the Indian, and even the South African programs all were ahead of what we had expected when they were exposed. For that matter, that was the case with Libya as well.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-proliferation expert noted, &quot;So, on balance, I doubt Iran has a nuclear weapon yet, but I also doubt that the program is in a stable state, even a stable state regarding weaponization. I think Iran is pushing ahead and has every intention to go all the way. So time on this may still be there, but it is short and running out fast. And of course, the consequences of an Iranian bomb are catastrophic for the region, for Israel’s survival, and for the status of American power in the globe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent saber-rattling over Iran’s nuclear weapons program from regime officials and lawmakers coincides with  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-atomic-watchdog-chief-travels-iran-grapples-tehrans-escalating-nuclear-program&quot;&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; chief Rafael Grossi’s May 8 statement that his organization was working &quot;very hard with [Iran] to prevent [nuclear weaponization] from happening.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washington D.C.-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-may-10-2024&quot;&gt;Institute for the Study of War&lt;/a&gt; wrote this suggests &quot;that Iran has already obtained or is close to obtaining the ability to procure nuclear weapons.&quot; The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital press query.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>UFC fighter Carlos Ulberg needed all of 12 seconds to top Alonzo Menifield in a light heavyweight bout in St. Louis on Saturday. He won via knockout.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It took Carlos Ulberg longer to walk into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ufc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;UFC Octagon&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday night in St. Louis than it did to knock out his opponent, Alonzo Menifield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two fighters touched gloves in the middle of the cage and it was Menifield who went on the attack first. However, he tripped and fell into the cage. It allowed Ulberg to launch into fists of fury. Ulberg connected with a left and stunned Menifield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ulberg hit Menifield with a right and the No. 11-ranked light heavyweight fighter fell onto his back. The referee then stopped the fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire bout lasted about 12 seconds. It was the third-fastest light heavyweight knockout in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/jorge-masvidal-ufc-239-knockout&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;UFC history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/espnmma/status/1789459514019725463&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW THE MOMENT ON X.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Ulberg’s sixth consecutive win dating back to March 2021, when he lost to Kennedy Nzechukwu via knockout. Menifield came into the bout with wins in four of five fights with a draw in the middle against Jimmy Crute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/michael-chandler-thinks-he-will-force-conor-mcgregor-retirement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MICHAEL CHANDLER CLAIMS CONOR MCGREGOR WILL NEVER WANT TO STEP &apos;BACK INTO THE OCTAGON&apos; AFTER UFC 303 BOUT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We knew he was going to come forward,&quot; Ulberg said, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mmafighting.com/2024/5/11/24154541/ufc-st-louis-video-carlos-ulberg-demolishes-alonzo-menifield-with-blistering-12-second-knockout&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;MMA Fighting&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;So I just had to do what I had to do. He did catch me, that woke up and when you wake a lion up, he comes up.

                    <description>Rachel Goldberg-Polin, the mother of 23-year-old Hamas hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, said that America should not be considered a &amp;quot;neutral negotiator&amp;quot; after Oct. 7.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mother of a 23-year-old American among the 132 hostages who remain held by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hamas militants&lt;/a&gt; said Sunday that the U.S. should not be considered a &quot;neutral negotiator&quot; and &quot;was also a victim&quot; on Oct. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Mother’s Day, Rachel Goldberg-Polin, mother of 23-year-old Hersh Goldberg-Polin, said during an appearance on &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; that &quot;it&apos;s clear not enough is being done because we still have 132 cherished souls who are being held captive for 219 days, and within that cohort of 132 souls, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/families-american-hostages-gaza-urge-biden-act-6-months-conflict-dont-have-time-wait&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the American 8.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall asked Goldberg-Polin whether she wanted to see ceasefire talks continue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think we really have to be creative and inciteful and figure out a way forward. Both sides really have to figure out a way forward, and calling for a timeout certainly will give some time for people to start to think straight again,&quot; Goldberg-Polin said in response. &quot;I think really what gets lost in this is America should not be considered sort of this neutral negotiator. America was also a victim on Oct. 7. Forty-five Americans were killed on Oct. 7. Twelve were taken into captivity, and eight are still being held hostage.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And I certainly want all the suffering in the region, and there’s so much suffering to go around, I mean there’s no competition here. There are hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians in Gaza who are suffering, and there are also 132 innocent civilians in Gaza who were dragged there on Oct. 7 who are suffering. I think people have trouble holding those two truths, and that does an injustice to everyone involved,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/bidens-arms-embargo-israel-emboldens-hamas-missile-strikes-jewish-state&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN&apos;S ARMS EMBARGO ON ISRAEL &apos;EMBOLDENS&apos; HAMAS MISSILE STRIKES AGAINST JEWISH STATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldberg-Polin said she did not believe most Americans know that American innocent civilians still remain held captive in Gaza, as do people from other nationalities around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are a lot of people in that hostage cohort that we don’t hear about,&quot; she said. &quot;When we hear a lot of noise about the hostages being held you very rarely hear about the Muslim Arabs who are hostage, you very rarely hear about the Thai Buddhists who are hostage, you very rarely hear about the Black Christian Africans who are being held hostage. There’s Nepalese. There are Mexicans, there are Argentinians, there are Germans, and somehow there has been an attempt to make this group of people a monolithic, homogenous group.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I find it curious and suspicious that for whatever reason, that has not been publicly saturating the news,&quot; Goldberg-Polin added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you think that an Israeli invasion into Rafah – do you think that perhaps that would put your son, put all these other hostages, their lives in danger? Hall also asked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m not a military strategist,&quot; Goldberg-Polin responded. &quot;I am a mother who is horribly, miserably worried about her only son who has been in an active war zone for 219 days, along with 131 other people.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-senate-democrat-joins-growing-chorus-lawmakers-breaking-biden-israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP SENATE DEMOCRAT JOINS GROWING CHORUS OF LAWMAKERS BREAKING FROM BIDEN ON ISRAEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted how the oldest remaining hostage is Shlomo Mansour&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; an 86-year-old grandfather, while the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/family-youngest-hamas-hostage-not-giving-hope-boy-marks-first-birthday-captivity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;youngest is Kfir Bibas&lt;/a&gt;, a one-and-a-half-year-old child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have daughters, sons, sisters, brothers, spouses, fathers, mothers, grandparents, and we are all horribly worried about our loved ones being in harm’s way,&quot; she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oct. 7 attack killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 250 hostage. Militants still hold about 100 captives and the remains of more than 30. Internationally mediated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/hamas-ceasefire-agreement-jailhouse-conversion-mike-pompeo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;talks over a cease-fire&lt;/a&gt; and hostage release appear to be at a standstill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israeli forces pushed deeper into Gaza&apos;s southern city of Rafah on Sunday and battled Hamas in parts of the devastated north that the military said it had cleared months ago but where militants have regrouped, the Associated Press reported. Warnings continued against the growing offensive in Rafah, considered the last refuge in Gaza for more than a million civilians as well as Hamas&apos; last stronghold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 300,000 people have fled Rafah following evacuation orders from Israel, which says it must invade to dismantle Hamas and return scores of hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack against Israel that sparked the war. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated opposition to a major military assault on Rafah, telling CBS that Israel would &quot;be left holding the bag on an enduring insurgency&quot; without an exit from Gaza and postwar governance plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Ex-Albanian president warns Biden that Russia seeks to &apos;undermine European values and foundations&apos; in region</title>
                    
                    <description>Albania&amp;apos;s former president and leader of the Freedom Party wants to keep the United States in the Balkans and prevent forces Russia from destabilizing the region.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST ON FOX&lt;/strong&gt; – Albania’s former President Ilir Meta has a clear message for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Don’t forget about Albania and the Western Balkans.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta, who was president of Albania from 2017 to 2022 and now leads the Party of Freedom, is worried that the United States is forgetting one of its most important European and NATO allies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, the former president said the Balkans is &quot;suffering from the status quo&quot; and that outside actors such as Russia have tried to hinder the region&apos;s EU integration and NATO membership.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They look to create a vacuum to be filled for them in order to undermine European values and foundations,&quot; Meta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/putin-fueling-regional-tensions-blinken-arrives-albania-bleak-picture&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PUTIN FUELING REGIONAL TENSIONS AS BLINKEN ARRIVES IN ALBANIA: &apos;BLEAK PICTURE&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small Balkan nation, one of Europe’s poorest, has made significant contributions to U.S. foreign policy goals over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albania, an authoritarian Marxist country with bitter relations with the U.S. during the Cold War, is now one of the most pro-U.S. countries in Europe and has a large diaspora community in the United States. But the amount of attention Albania receives from President Biden and Western policymakers is little for a country struggling to consolidate its democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the U.S. is prioritizing its support of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ukraine against Russia’s invasion&lt;/a&gt; while at the same time backing Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza, many in the Balkans worry the region isn’t receiving the attention it needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former president’s fears of U.S. absence come after the news that Aleksandar Vulin, Serbia’s former head of intelligence who has close ties to Russia and is sanctioned by the U.S., will join Serbia’s new government. Vulin was accused of being involved in transnational organized crime, illegal narcotics operations, and misuse of public office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement is seen by many in the U.S. and across Europe as an indication that Serbia is not abandoning its pro-Russian sentiments even while it seeks EU membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are disappointed to see two sanctioned individuals in positions in the new government,&quot; a State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The United States’ top priority in the Western Balkans is supporting the countries in the region to realize their full economic and democratic potential through Euro-Atlantic integration and regional cooperation. This path includes full alignment with the European Union on foreign and security policy,&quot; the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/bidens-arms-embargo-israel-emboldens-hamas-missile-strikes-jewish-state&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZELENSKYY WARNS RUSSIA WANTS TO CAUSE &apos;EXPLOSION&apos; IN THE BALKANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former President Meta warned about the dangers of the &quot;Open Balkans&quot; initiative, a proposal that would facilitate a freer flow of people and goods across the Balkans, which on the surface seems like it would benefit the region. But Meta called the initiative an &quot;alternative against European integration,&quot; and fears it will strengthen hybrid regimes like Serbia that will undermine free and fair elections, eliminate political pluralism, and target the media and freedom of speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serbia&apos;s new minister of foreign affairs, Marko Djuric, took issue with Meta&apos;s framing of the Open Balkans Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Serbia is proud of its democratic efforts, including the Open Balkans initiative. We encourage economic cooperation and connectivity in the region to foster stability and create prosperity for all nations involved. Serbia is proud of its democratic efforts, including the Open Balkans initiative. We regret that such efforts are misinterpreted as undermining democracy when, in fact, they do the opposite by enhancing cooperation and mutual understanding,&quot; Djuric told Fox News Digital in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Djuric said Serbia seeks to contribute to and uphold the region’s stability, security and prosperity and remains committed to the European Union integration process, a point that many in the West are skeptical about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Serbia&apos;s engagement in the Balkans is guided by principles of democracy, respect for sovereignty, and regional cooperation. We are committed to our EU path while also pursuing partnerships that contribute to peace and development in the region.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agim Nesho, former Albanian ambassador to the U.S. and the United Nations, told Fox News Digital that Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Albanian Prime Minister Rama &quot;are the most undemocratic, corrupt, and destabilizing leaders the region has seen in 30 years&quot; and are not advancing U.S. or European interests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nesho and other observers of the region say the idea that placating Serbia will keep it closer to Europe than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Putin&apos;s Russia &lt;/a&gt;is wishful thinking and has given ultranationalist Serbs and President Vucic a strong hand to play with the West. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Open Balkans initiative is basically a forum for coordinating their policies with Moscow to advance both Serbian and Russian interests in the Balkans, Nesho claimed. that U.S. appeasement of Serbia’s disruptive policies allows Vucic to leverage both the Serbian entity in Bosnia-Herzegovina to create instability, and to keep the northern Kosovo region as a frozen conflict, highlighting a clear lack of strategy from the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serbia&apos;s Foreign Minister Djuric rejected such criticism and told Fox News Digital that he recently met with the U.S. ambassador to Serbia and he &quot;emphasized that strengthening cooperation with the United States is among the top foreign policy priorities of the Serbian government. Our political, economic and cultural relations have undergone a positive and beneficial transformation in recent years, and we are committed to further enhancing this partnership for the mutual benefit of our nations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He concluded, &quot;Serbian President Vucic has been very public about all of this. As the president said recently: ‘We believe we belong in Europe and we will stay on the European path. That is our strategic, permanent position that we will not change.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia, through its regional allies, exerts significant cultural and political sway in the Balkans, and has been accused of inciting violence and instability. Serbia acts as the player in the Kremlin’s bid for prominence in the Balkans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Putin is leveraging crises in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina to divert attention from Ukraine and to position Russia as the sole mediator of the crisis,&quot; Ivana Stradner, research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This plan aims to strengthen Moscow’s regional influence and give Putin leverage over Western powers who do not want the violence to escalate,&quot; Stradner added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta concluded by saying that the people of the Balkans love the United States because they see it as a symbol of democracy and the country, in Meta’s eyes, must never forget this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The United States must never forget that, and how important the Balkans are for Europe and, that Albania can be a long-term partner in helping face many global challenges,&quot; Meta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital requests for comment to the spokesperson for Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama were not returned by time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Charlamagne tha God said that voters can choose between Republicans, Democrats and &amp;quot;voter apathy&amp;quot; in the 2024 presidential election.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Charlamagne tha God, the popular host of &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; radio show, bashed the conservative and liberal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;media spheres&lt;/a&gt; for creating division in America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are insane right now,&quot; Charlamagne said in an interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/11/magazine/charlamagne-tha-god-interview.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; about the current state of U.S. politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I blame the media so much for what’s happening,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/radio-host-charlamagne-tha-god-rips-dei-efforts-workplace-mostly-garbage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;RADIO HOST CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD RIPS DEI EFFORTS IN WORKPLACE: &apos;MOSTLY GARBAGE&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlamagne said that he believes in telling the truth to both sides and &quot;being objective.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I tell people all the time, ‘If you lie to them about Democrats, they won’t believe you when you tell them the truth about Republicans.’&quot; he explained. &quot;So why would I sit there and lie to people about the flaws I see in the Democratic Party?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlamagne also spoke out on the three choices he believes voters have this year in the presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-is-an-uninspiring-candidate-charlamagne-tha-god-says-no-main-character-energy-at-all&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN IS AN &apos;UNINSPIRING CANDIDATE,&apos; CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD SAYS: &apos;NO MAIN CHARACTER ENERGY AT ALL&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This election is three options: Republicans who are the crooks, Democrats who are the cowards because they don’t fight enough for nothing, and the couch,&quot; he said. &quot;And the couch is voter apathy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlamagne said that Americans in general are &quot;discouraged with politics,&quot; but said he still believes the 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;presidential election&lt;/a&gt; is easily &quot;the most consequential election&quot; of his lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But it’s hard to get people to believe that, because we say that about every presidential election, because every Republican candidate has been demonized,&quot; Charlamagne admitted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There’s all this talk about people being tired of Democrats,&quot; he added. &quot;No, people are just tired of politics.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The podcaster and radio host referenced several media controversies that he has starred in over the last few years, claiming that some of them were blown out of proportion by &quot;right-wing media.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Charlamagne told ABC that Biden was an &quot;uninspiring candidate&quot; who was not charismatic and had &quot;no main character energy at all.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just two months later, Charlamagne said that DEI efforts are &quot;well-intentioned&quot; but &quot;mostly garbage,&quot; arguing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/harvard-law-professor-urges-university-abandon-dei-statements-ideological-pledges-allegiance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;diversity efforts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had backfired at companies across the U.S. and actually created worse work environments for Black employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Kristine Parks and Hanna Panreck contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Obama judge mocks top Dem law firm in Wisconsin election lawsuit: &apos;Makes no sense&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>A federal judge ruled against and seemingly ridiculed a lawsuit brought against a Wisconsin voting law that requires a witness in order to verify an absentee ballot.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A federal judge ripped into a top Democratic law firm that was attempting to challenge an absentee ballot witness requirement&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/wisconsin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; in Wisconsin.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Normally, the court would begin by searching for other textual clues in the statute. But in this case, the most obvious problem with plaintiffs’ interpretation is that it simply does not make any sense,&quot; U.S. District Judge James Peterson said in a ruling against the Elias Law Group, the firm founded by Democratic super lawyer and former Clinton campaign general counsel Marc Elias, which was attempting to challenge the Wisconsin law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the issue is Wisconsin&apos;s state statute under § 6.87(2), which lays out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/voting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;absentee voting requirements&lt;/a&gt; in the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wisconsin-becomes-28th-state-to-pass-a-ban-on-zuckerbucks-ahead-of-2024-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WISCONSIN BECOMES 28TH STATE TO PASS A BAN ON ‘ZUCKERBUCKS’ AHEAD OF 2024 ELECTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wisconsin law requires voters to both certify that they meet the requirements to vote and that they have followed the correct process for filling out an absentee ballot, which includes a section that requires &quot;witness certification.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elias said the witness requirement violates the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Civil Rights Act of 1964, arguing that a witness would be forced to verify the eligibility of the voter filling out the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Under plaintiffs’ interpretation, every witness would have to determine the voter’s age, residence, citizenship, criminal history, whether the voter is unable or unwilling to vote in person, whether the voter has voted at another location or is planning to do so, whether the voter is capable of understanding the objective of the voting process, whether the voter is under a guardianship, and, if so, whether a court has determined that the voter is competent,&quot; Peterson, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/barack-obama&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Obama appointee&lt;/a&gt;, wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wisconsin-gov-evers-vetoes-gop-voting-election-audit-bills-greenlights-political-ai-crackdown&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WISCONSIN GOV. EVERS VETOES GOP VOTING, ELECTION AUDIT BILLS; GREENLIGHTS POLITICAL AI CRACKDOWN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Many witnesses would be unable to independently verify much of the required information,&quot; Peterson continued. &quot;The statute allows any adult U.S. citizen to serve as a witness, suggesting that a wide variety of people should be able to do the job… It makes no sense to interpret § 6.87 in a way that would make compliance virtually impossible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision follows the top firm&apos;s failure in another Wisconsin case, which saw Elias attempt to force the state to redraw its congressional maps. But the Wisconsin Supreme Court opted not to hear the case, a victory for Republicans in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Turley, Fox News Media contributor and the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University, noted that Elias himself has been at the center of several controversies and courtroom losses in recent memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Elias has been sanctioned in past litigation. Yet, other Democrats have continued to hire Elias despite his checkered past,&quot; Turley wrote Saturday. &quot;Elias unsuccessfully led efforts to challenge Democratic losses.  Elias also was the subject of intense criticism after a tweet that some have called inherently racist.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Elias Law Group did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Caitlin Clark recalls &apos;frustrating&apos; media storm over 2023 national championship loss</title>
                    
                    <description>Caitlin Clark expressed frustration with the media coverage over her in-game battle with Angel Reese during the 2023 women&amp;apos;s college basketball national championship.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The 2023 women’s college basketball national championship saw LSU’s Angel Reese take down Iowa’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/fevers-caitlin-clark-draws-record-crowd-indiana-debut-pretty-unheard-of&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Caitlin Clark&lt;/a&gt; with the former giving the latter a taste of her own medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark talked about the in-game rivalry between the two players and lamented that it became all anyone would talk about for days instead of the two lifting up the game. Clark’s comments were made on ESPN’s docuseries &quot;Full Court Press.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&apos;s the only thing people wanted to talk about when we just went on this magical run and united so many people, and that, like, was frustrating to me,&quot; Clark said in one episode, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/wnba/article-13407869/caitlin-clark-angel-reese-title-game-celebration.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;The Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iowa coach Lisa Bluder also hit out at the media for trying to &quot;create a circus out of racial things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/angel-reese-says-frustrating-drama-caitlin-clark-overshadowed-lsus-championship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Reese both insisted&lt;/a&gt; at the time, and during the 2023-24 season, there was no animosity between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/caitlin-clark-attends-pacers-knicks-playoff-game-fever-teammates-in-suite&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAITLIN CLARK ATTENDS PACERS-KNICKS PLAYOFF GAME WITH FEVER TEAMMATES IN SUITE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Me and Caitlin Clark don&apos;t hate each other. I want everybody to understand that. It&apos;s just a super competitive game,&quot; Reese said before the two met in the Elite Eight back in April. &quot;Once I get between those lines, there&apos;s no friends. I have plenty of friends on the court that I talk to outside of the game, but like when I get between those lines, we&apos;re not friends. We&apos;re not buddies. I&apos;m going to talk trash to you. I&apos;m going to do whatever it takes to get in your head the whole entire game, but after the game we can kick it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark added that they both shared the same &quot;competitive fire.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Me and Angel have always been great competitors,&quot; she said. &quot;Obviously, she played in the Big Ten for a while to begin her career, and that&apos;s what makes women&apos;s basketball so fun is you have great competition, and that&apos;s what we&apos;ve had all year long. I think Angel would say the same.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in the documentary, Clark talked about the &quot;hardest part&quot; about being her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The hardest part about being Caitlin Clark? I’d say is having to feel like you’re always on,&quot; she said, via the New York Post. &quot;You just have bad days, and there are days where you don’t want to talk to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But somebody comes up to you, and this is their 10-second interaction with you. So you better smile and be kind. But at the same time, it’s just like, you just want to be normal sometimes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Clark and Reese are both preparing to make their WNBA regular-season debuts. Clark was the No. 1 overall pick of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/wnba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Indiana Fever&lt;/a&gt; while Reese was selected by the Chicago Sky a little later in the first round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>DOJ seeks 40-year sentence for Paul Pelosi hammer attacker David DePape under &apos;terrorism enhancement&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Federal prosecutors requested a 40-year-sentence for David DePape, the man convicted of attacking Nancy Pelosi&amp;apos;s husband with a hammer, under a terrorism enhancement.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/justice-department&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; is seeking a 40-year sentence for David DePape under a &quot;terrorism enhancement&quot; in connection to the hammer attack on Paul Pelosi at his and his wife, Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s California home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a memo filed on Friday in the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, federal prosecutors said they disagreed with the Probation Office’s decision not to apply the terrorism enhancement given DePape expressed &quot;no remorse&quot; after &quot;nearly killing Mr. Pelosi in his effort to also kidnap the Speaker Emerita.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The nature and circumstances of the offense warrant statutory maximums on each count. The core of both crimes – the attempted kidnapping of a public official and the assault on the family member of a public official – is violence aimed at punishing the former Speaker of the House of Representatives,&quot; U.S. attorney Ismail Ramsey wrote. &quot;Both crimes are an assault on our democracy and fundamental values.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The jury rejected the defendant’s contentions that he was motivated by something other than the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/nancy-pelosi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Speaker Emerita’s&lt;/a&gt; official position, but even taking his own statements as true for a moment, the defendant claimed that he went to the Pelosi’s home to inflict violence on the Speaker Emerita,&quot; Ramsey continued. &quot;He wanted to teach a lesson. The violent lessons that the defendant wanted to teach are not permitted in this country, and the sentence that this Court imposes must reflect the nature and circumstances of the offense.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/paul-pelosi-attack-suspect-david-depape-found-guilty-federal-trial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAUL PELOSI ATTACK SUSPECT DAVID DEPAPE FOUND GUILTY IN FEDERAL TRIAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DePape was convicted last year of attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on the immediate family member of a federal official. He is scheduled to be sentenced Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack on then-82-year-old Paul Pelosi was captured on police body camera video just days before the 2022 midterm elections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DePape admitted during trial testimony that he broke into the Pelosi home intending to hold the then-Speaker hostage and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/david-depape-considered-nancy-pelosi-evil-saved-her-personal-info-laptop-prosecution-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;break her kneecaps&quot;&lt;/a&gt; if she lied to him. He also admitted to bludgeoning Paul Pelosi with a hammer after police showed up at the home, saying his plan to end what he viewed as government corruption was unraveling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defense attorneys said DePape was motivated by his political beliefs and caught up in conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/david-depape-weeps-stand-apologizes-paul-pelosi-hammer-attack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAVID DEPAPE WEEPS ON STAND, APOLOGIZES TO PAUL PELOSI FOR HAMMER ATTACK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is nothing about the history and characteristics of the defendant that warrant leniency.  The defendant has admitted – indeed bragged – that he knew what he was doing when he packed his bags and went to the Pelosi’s home,&quot; Ramsey wrote. &quot;The government acknowledges that the defendant had difficult relationship with his biological father and then with a romantic partner.  To the extent that these relationships bear on the instant offense, it appears to be because of some amount of isolation.  To be sure, isolation may have led the defendant to spend time on YouTube and consuming media that led him to adopt the views that motivated his actions.  But the defendant’s history and characteristics do not excuse the instant offense, nor give a reason for leniency given the violent extremism that the defendant unleashed in October 2022.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nancy Pelosi was not at home at the time of the October 2022 incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From custody, DePape &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/paul-pelosi-attacker-david-depape-makes-chilling-call-tv-station-im-so-sorry-i-didnt-get-more-them&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;called the KTVU newsroom&lt;/a&gt;. In the call that was also played out during the trial, he said he had &quot;an important message for everyone in America – you’re welcome.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said a medical examination at the hospital showed Paul Pelosi &quot;suffered two skull fractures that had to be repaired in emergency surgery, along with a wound to his arm and his hand, which were also treated in surgery by specialized surgeons.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At trial, &quot;a neurosurgeon who performed the surgeries testified that one of the skull fractures narrowly missed a vein that if lacerated would have caused life-threatening blood loss,&quot; the motion said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday&apos;s motion said DePape &quot;planned a violent hostage-taking of the Speaker Emerita, and then nearly killed her husband.&quot; Given &quot;the defendant planned and unleashed violence and has stayed true to his belief that his actions were necessary,&quot; the government recommended that the Court impose a term of 20 years on the attempted kidnapping count and 30 years on the assault count, with 20 years on count two to run consecutive to count one. Prosecutors said the Court should also impose &quot;a term of three years of supervised release on Count One and five years on Count 2, and a $100 special assessment per count.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Fox News contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier shared her tips for falling and staying asleep during &amp;apos;Fox &amp;amp; Friends Weekend.&amp;apos;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/nicole-saphier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier&lt;/a&gt; is sharing her best sleep advice this Mother&apos;s Day for new moms navigating the realms of parenthood as many Americans admit they struggle to get enough shuteye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Saphier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/shows/fox-and-friends&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;joined &quot;Fox &amp;amp; Friends Weekend&quot;&lt;/a&gt; to share the best tips for those who struggle to fall and stay asleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/sleep-disorders-suicide-mental-health-expert-reveals-link&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SLEEP DISORDERS AND SUICIDE: A MENTAL HEALTH EXPERT REVEALS THE CONCERNING LINK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Anywhere from 30 to 50% of Americans say that they have difficulty sleeping,&quot; Dr. Saphier told co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy on Sunday. &quot;Ten percent of them have such bad sleep that it actually interferes with their day-to-day life… I don&apos;t know about the trend... I try to stay away from any trends, but there are some things you can do to get better sleep, especially as new moms or just moms in general.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;First of all, there are medical conditions that can cause you to have poor sleep like gastroesophageal reflux apnea and others. So if...your sleep patterns have changed, definitely talk to your doctor about it, but for me, the things that are a must, you absolutely have to say goodbye to electronics at least an hour before bedtime. This signals to your brain, those bright lights are gone, it is time to go to bed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Saphier advises those who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/americans-need-more-sleep-less-stress-experts-say-gallup-poll-reveals-troubling-findings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;battle sleep challenges&lt;/a&gt; to keep the room cool and avoid large meals before it&apos;s time to go to bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Exercise during the day. Don&apos;t have a big meal, and you and I both like to have some herbal teas. You can add magnolia bark, ashwagandha, and some other things that can help you sleep as well,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/lack-sleep-could-be-factor-silent-epidemic-experts-warn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LACK OF SLEEP COULD BE A FACTOR IN A ‘SILENT EPIDEMIC,&apos; EXPERTS WARN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a recent Gallup poll revealed 57% of adults would &quot;feel better if they got more sleep,&quot; while 42% said they get &quot;as much sleep as they need.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings have nearly reversed in the last decade, Gallup noted in a press release. The last measurement in 2013 found that 56% of Americans got the sleep they needed while 43% did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, however, Americans are getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/struggling-fall-asleep-try-simple-trick-drift&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;fewer hours of sleep&lt;/a&gt; than they did in past decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1942, 59% of Americans were getting eight hours or more of sleep per night, while only 3% were getting five hours or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, only 25% of Americans get an average of eight hours of sleep, and 20% reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;sleeping for five or less&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young women are the least likely to get enough sleep, according to the study — with 36% of females versus 48% of males reporting getting enough shuteye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Angelica Stabile contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>JK Rowling leads criticism after transgender woman managing women&apos;s soccer club is celebrated</title>
                    
                    <description>&amp;quot;Harry Potter&amp;quot; author J.K. Rowling led the criticism over the weekend against an English soccer club naming a transgender woman the manager of a women&amp;apos;s team.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sutton United, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/soccer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;women’s football club &lt;/a&gt;in England that plays in the London and South East Women&apos;s Regional Football League, made history earlier this year when it named Lucy Clark as manager. Clark is the first transgender manager in women’s soccer history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark was initially the first transgender woman to be a referee. Clark was a referee in the third tier of women’s soccer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in England&lt;/a&gt;. Clark, at the time, called the appointment to manager of Sutton United &quot;kind of a dream come true,&quot; according to BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Pride UK – an LGBTQIA+ advocacy group – expressed support for Clark as the manager of Sutton United, touting Clark’s rise from being a referee to now leading a soccer club. The post garnered a ton of reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When I was young all the football managers were straight, white, middle-aged blokes, so it&apos;s fantastic to see how much things have changed,&quot; &quot;Harry Potter&quot; author &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/jk-rowling-defends-pediatrician-avoid-public-transit-gender-study-controversy-follow-money&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;J.K. Rowling&lt;/a&gt; wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australian lawyer Katherine Deves Morgan wrote, &quot;Middle-aged bloke celebrated for cross-dressing on the soccer field. What an easy way to make yourself the centre of attention.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British politician Jayda Fransen added that Clark’s appointment was &quot;offensive to both men and women.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/surfing-organization-pulls-about-face-on-trans-inclusion-after-pressure-from-california-coastal-commission&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SURFING ORGANIZATION PULLS ABOUT-FACE ON TRANS INCLUSION AFTER PRESSURE FROM CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Men up &amp;amp; down the country manage football teams, many are volunteers but they aren’t celebrated because they don’t wear wigs,&quot; Fransen wrote. &quot;Since this is another man in a predominantly male role, it’s NOT an unusual achievement, just a man mocking women.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark responded to the remarks on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Another day of hate fuelled transphobia against me… but hey guess what I am living my best life,&quot; Clark wrote. &quot;Wake up everyday with my beautiful family around me. Everyday I laugh and have things to look forward too. Who’s winning at life… the one who’s happy and smiling or those hating?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So JK, Posie, Glinner and the rest of you out there hating on my community and myself guess what IDGAF… you keep hating and I will keep on smiling and living my best life. Maybe you should all give it a try eh.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The London and South East Women&apos;s Regional Football League is in the fifth tier of women’s soccer. Sutton United is eighth in the standings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MSNBC analyst David Jolly attacked presidential candidate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/rfk-jr-says-supports-abortion-even-full-term&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;RFK Jr.&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, calling him a &quot;vaccine denier&quot; whose candidacy will ultimately hurt Republicans more than Democrats in the 2024 election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I still think RFK Junior can take more from Republicans,&quot; Jolly, a former representative from Florida, said. &quot;I think that is why Trump is attacking him.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He is a MAGA-crazy Republican, he is a vaccine denier,&quot; Jolly continued. &quot;He denies science. He flip-flops on the issue of abortion, and even his own VP candidate can’t keep up with where he is day to day on the most important issue going into November.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rfk-jr-said-worm-ate-part-his-brain-and-died-his-head&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;RFK JR SAID A WORM ATE PART OF HIS BRAIN AND DIED IN HIS HEAD&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former President Donald Trump released a video against Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&apos;s campaign for presidency on his social media platform, Truth Social.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;d even take Biden over Jr. because our country would last about a year or two later than with Jr. It would collapse almost immediately. And his family — a radical left, a crazy left, a bunch of lunatics — would take over and our country would die very quickly,&quot; Trump said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former president also said that Kennedy&apos;s opposition to COVID vaccines was &quot;fake.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He is not a Republican, so don&apos;t think you&apos;re going to vote for him and feel good,&quot; Trump added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rfk-jr-reveals-path-presidency-biden-trump-campaigns-target-race-spoiler&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;RFK, JR REVEALS PATH TO PRESIDENCY AS BIDEN, TRUMP CAMPAIGNS TARGET RACE &apos;SPOILER&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jolly also called out Kennedy amid recent reports that the presidential candidate once testified that part of his brain was eaten by a parasitic worm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now he says he has a worm eating his brain,&quot; Jolly said, claiming that makes Kennedy &quot;a perfect Republican today.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who knows how he takes in specific states that really matter to a Biden victory in November, but I would tell you that this guy really speaks to the Aaron Rodgers Republican, which ultimately could take from the MAGA crowd,&quot; Jolly continued. &quot;I suspect to see Biden having fun with RFK in November.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFL superstar and New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers became a nationally divisive political voice after he spoke out against COVID vaccine mandates. Rodgers said he &quot;immunized&quot; from COVID-19 during the 2021 NFL season despite not taking a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has been attacked by both conservative and liberal commentators in recent weeks, especially over his views on abortion. Appearing on Wednesday&apos;s installment of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/sage-steele-off-sidelines-speaking-her-mind&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Sage Steele Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; the candidate said that he personally supports abortion &quot;even if it&apos;s full term.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy&apos;s campaign did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Ryan Morik and Joseph A. Wulfsohn contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Houston transgender suspect runs over, fatally stabs man: police</title>
                    
                    <description>A transgender woman with a criminal past is accused of running over a 64-year-old man with a car twice before fatally stabbing him, and it was caught on video.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A suspect allegedly seen on video running over a man twice with a car before straddling, kissing and fatally stabbing him multiple times in broad daylight has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;charged with murder.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karon Fisher, 20, is described in court documents obtained &lt;a href=&quot;https://abc13.com/post/woodridge-square-drive-stabbing-man-ran-over-murder-suspect-caught-on-video/14796978/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;by KTRK-TV&lt;/a&gt; as a man, but is referred to as a &quot;she&quot; by the Houston Police Department. The homicide took place around 7:50 p.m. May 3, police said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neighbor video obtained by KTRK appears to show an intentional attack on the man who was said to be on his way to pick up his mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It shows the victim, identified in reports as 64-year-old Steven Anderson, turning around to look at the screeching white car barreling towards him, before it struck him and reversed to hit him a second time. The suspect, seen in all-black, then appears with a knife in hand before flipping Anderson over, straddling him, kissing him and then stabbing him nine times.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/houston-police-identify-man-wanted-killing-attorney-mcdonalds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOUSTON POLICE IDENTIFY MAN WANTED FOR KILLING ATTORNEY AT MCDONALD&apos;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspect then tries getting into another car unsuccessfully before jumping over the victim&apos;s body and taking off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officers were called to the scene regarding someone who failed to stop and help another person. Anderson was found by officers with multiple stab wounds already dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-teen-arrested-kaitlin-hernandezs-murder-months-teen-found-dead-naked-ditch&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEXAS TEEN ARRESTED IN KAITLIN HERNANDEZ&apos;S MURDER MONTHS AFTER TEEN FOUND DEAD, NAKED IN DITCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witnesses led officers to the suspect at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/houston-and-galveston&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;nearby location.&lt;/a&gt; She was detained and questioned by detectives prior to being charged and taken to the Harris County Jail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local TV station KPRC said police do not know of a relationship between the suspect and the victim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fisher was reportedly on community supervision for evading arrest in 2023, according to KTRK. She was also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;charged with prostitution&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, but that case was dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online jail records say Fisher&apos;s next court appearance is May 24. Her bond amount has been set at $2.125 million. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Here&apos;s why Ireland is at boiling point over mass immigration</title>
                    
                    <description>Hundreds of protests in towns have sprung up in Ireland with people calling on the government to end what they say is an &amp;quot;open borders&amp;quot; globalist agenda that is putting the needs of migrants ahead of its citizens.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Irish government’s unwavering commitment to housing and feeding an unprecedented influx of migrants in the wake of a severe housing and cost of living crisis has brought the Irish electorate to boiling point. It has many similarities to the migrant crisis in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of protests in towns have sprung up around the country with people calling on the government to end what they say is an &quot;open borders&quot; globalist agenda that is putting the needs of migrants ahead of its citizens -- many of whom are struggling to pay for everyday items and unable to buy or rent homes as Ireland’s homeless numbers skyrockets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several high-profile crimes linked to migrants have also driven fear into the native citizenry, culminating in the shocking knife attacks on young children and their teacher by an Algerian-born Irish citizen in November that triggered rioting and looting in the nation’s capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/34-arrested-ireland-riots-child-stabbed-dublin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;34 ARRESTED IN IRELAND RIOTS AFTER CHILD IS STABBED IN DUBLIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who want &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;immigration laws&lt;/a&gt; enforced and numbers reduced say they are being ignored by the political establishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ireland is a tinderbox at the moment,&quot; Irish journalist Fatima Gunning told Fox News Digital. &quot;At this point, I don&apos;t think anything would surprise me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, thousands of protesters carrying Irish flags rallied in Dublin calling for an end to mass migration and demanding that a new nationalist government take its place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chants of &quot;get them out&quot; in reference to the government, echoed throughout the nation’s capital while others carried signs reading &quot;Irish lives matter&quot; and &quot;under siege, invasion.&quot; Large banners reading &quot;mass deportations&quot; and &quot;end the plantation&quot; hung from a bridge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protesters say they represent the silent majority of the electorate – around 75% based on several polls – who say immigration is too high and that the country has taken in too many refugees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their anger is also being fueled by how they are being treated by the mainstream media, which is dominated by liberal news outlets as well as the semi-state-run broadcaster RTE, who seldom cover protests or do so with bias, they say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of an America without Fox News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, last Monday’s march was described as a &quot;large crowd&quot; by RTE and afforded just six lines of coverage on its website. Gript, a relative newcomer to the media scene, has been filling the void and has covered many anti-mass immigration protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For the past two years, they&apos;ve been calling people like that ‘racist’ or ‘far-right extremists,’&quot; Gunning says. &quot;Politicians and the mainstream media, official Ireland, that of strata of society say immigration is just totally positive. There&apos;s no negatives whatsoever and then anyone who even says something like, Oh, ‘I do agree with immigration but I think there should be controls on the numbers,’ is a racist, that&apos;s how it is.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immigration into Ireland has more than doubled over the last 20 years with 22% of the population now made up of non-citizens, meaning Ireland has the fourth largest non-national population of all 27 EU member states percentage-wise, according to published &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20240327-1&quot;&gt;EU statistics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The steady increase in migration first started with the free movement of people agreement under the EU’s Nice Treaty in 2003. It posed little problems as mainly eastern Europeans traveled to Ireland to work in the Celtic Tiger economic boom era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in recent years, droves of high numbers of asylum seekers have been arriving at Ireland’s shores and are being handed all sorts of taxpayer-funded welfare benefits and housing, while Irish citizens struggle to make ends meet with high inflation, a crippling housing crisis and an overwhelmed health system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Ireland has taken in more than 104,000 Ukrainian refugees since the onset of the war, the largest number per capita in Western Europe despite Ireland being the most westerly located nation in the whole of Europe. The figure equates to 2% of Ireland’s 5.12 million population and every Ukrainian refugee has been provided with free accommodation, free health care and, until recently, was being paid a weekly wage of around $235.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another 30,000 non-Ukrainian refugees are currently being housed by the Irish government with taxpayers churning out more than €1 billion in the first nine months of 2023 accommodating migrants, according to government data. Meanwhile, the country’s debt is among the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;highest in the world&lt;/a&gt; per capita, standing at €223 billion in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accommodations, including modular homes, have been built for migrants but very little, if anything, they say, is being done for the homeless population, which hit an all-time record last month. Planning rules to build some of these homes have been ignored in order to get the refugees housed at rapid speed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&apos;s a really palpable feeling that these non-national people are being prioritized over Irish people, which they are,&quot; Gunning says. &quot;I mean, it&apos;s not even a matter of opinion that they are. There are Irish people who cannot get medical cards (health benefits) for whatever reason. These people are all given medical cards regardless of need and that&apos;s obviously a priority [of government].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it&apos;s not just the perceived unfairness that has angered Irish people. Just like in the U.S., Irish people feel that many of those seeking asylum have dubious claims and are essentially economic migrants who are draining taxpayer coffers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/dublin-sees-heavy-police-presence-11-arrests-irish-lives-matter-march-globalist-mass-migration&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DUBLIN SEES HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE, 11 ARRESTS AMID &apos;IRISH LIVES MATTER&apos; MARCH AGAINST MASS MIGRATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of those making asylum seeker claims &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/ireland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Ireland,&lt;/a&gt; Georgian nationals have had the highest numbers of claims despite it being designated a &quot;safe country of origin&quot; by the Irish government. Asylum seekers have also been arriving from Nigeria, where 2,000 have arrived already this year, as well as Algeria, Somalia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Zimbabwe. Countries that don&apos;t share customs or traditions with Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious concerns have also been raised about a large percentage of those asylum seekers being single men, that background checks have not been carried out on them and that they are loitering around towns and cities with nothing to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some people get very upset when they hear it&apos;s just men because there&apos;s leaking footage from City West [hotel] in Dublin… of them just rioting inside the place. And, you know, last year it kicked off, around Ramadan, they were just rioting and throwing chairs at each other,&quot; Gunning says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So people feel frightened about that because ultimately these people are unvetted. You&apos;ll hear that they are vetted, they&apos;re not. Their fingerprints are run through this thing called Eurodac, which is not a criminal vetting system, it&apos;s just to see if they have made other asylum claims elsewhere or if they have been caught doing illegal border crossings. It doesn&apos;t have any criminal data to it at all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So the government consistently uses that to say that they&apos;re vetted when in fact they&apos;re not.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gunning, who reports for Gript.ie, was at the scene of an ugly encounter two weeks ago when Irish police in riot gear clashed with locals of a small town who were protesting against plans to convert a shuttered care facility into a shelter for 160 male migrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The town, Newtownmounkennedy, is a typical rural community with a population of about 3,000 and is starved of services. Gunning says locals told her that the government promised them that the facility would be used as a much-needed community center for the town, while they were also concerned that the men are unvetted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gunning says locals were also incensed that foreign men in masks were seen working on the site, leading to comparisons to the plantations of Ireland in the 1500s and 1600s when the British confiscated Irish-owned land and gave it to settlers. Hence, the &quot;end the plantation&quot; banner at the protest in Dublin on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After weeks of peacefully protesting and pleading with the government to reconsider, the riot police were deployed in Newtownmounkennedy to stamp out the demonstration. But the forcefulness of the response sent shockwaves through the community, which rallied in even bigger numbers in the days that followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, it was all in vain as the first wave of migrants began arriving at the site around the same time as a migrant &quot;tent city&quot; of about 200 tents in nearby Dublin was being dismantled by the government. The tents were set up outside the country’s International Protections Office, which processes claims, and for many Irish people the tents became a visual example of the government&apos;s handling of the crisis. Many of the migrants have now set up their tents along Dublin&apos;s Grand Canal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation at Newtownmounkennedy has been happening throughout Ireland and the locals, despite their protests, say they have no say in the matter. In some towns, local hotels have all been converted into migrant shelters, decimating tourist industries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, and just like in the U.S., some hoteliers and construction companies are profiting as government contracts ensure full occupancy and a steady stream of building work keeps the revenue flowing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s just emerged that there was a whole estate being built without planning permission, and now they&apos;ve filled that with international protection applicants,&quot; Gunning says. &quot;So it&apos;s really crazy. And there&apos;s a lot of money being made here, an awful lot of money.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the cries grow louder and the government refuses to change course, anger among demonstrators has exploded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some have protested outside the homes of the new prime minister, Richard Harris, and integration minister Roderic O’Gorman. The latter has been accused of making Ireland a popular magnet for migrants after he posted online a notice in eight different languages detailing the attractive benefits they will get if they claim asylum in Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of Irish Justice Minister Helen McEntee’s family were evacuated from their home last week following two hoax bomb threats. McEntee has faced tremendous pressure for her handling of the crisis due, in part, to the country’s low deportation numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, McEntee recently revealed that of the nearly 7,300 people refused refugee status in Ireland since the beginning of 2023, less than 100 have been deported. She also said that more than 90% of people seeking asylum in the country are now crossing the land border with Northern Ireland amid the UK&apos;s clampdown on ineligible refugees via its Rwanda policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who are these people flowing into the country and where are these people now, critics ask?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the government’s figures, 85% of people who applied for international protection at Dublin Airport in 2023 arrived without identity documents or with false identity documents, which is illegal, yet very few were even prosecuted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Irish government has long argued that it is bound by &quot;international obligations&quot; to accommodate those who arrive claiming asylum, while critics say the same level of urgency is not given to Irish people who are homeless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/rioters-clash-police-torch-car-knife-attack-dublin&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIOTERS CLASH WITH POLICE, TORCH CAR AFTER KNIFE ATTACK IN DUBLIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s new Migration Pact is being held up as a silver bullet solution, a &quot;game changer,&quot; according to McEntee, but some critics say it will only exacerbate the situation. The pact aims to cut the time for security and asylum procedures at external EU borders and increase the number of people being sent back to the Middle East and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We always do the right thing [in Ireland], and for me, the right thing is providing protection for those who genuinely need it,&quot; McEntee said recently. &quot;The world is a changing place, there’s significant increases in conflict across the globe, climate change is having a massive impact, and there are people who are genuinely fleeing starvation, persecution and war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think as a country -- particularly people who have sought refuge in other countries over the years -- there is an onus on us and people want to us to provide that protection. And at the same time, those who are coming here seeking economic benefits, and we don’t blame them for that, this is not the right system to use.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the despair and disillusionment of those on the right who oppose mass immigration is that they are not represented in the political process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fine Gael, McEntee’s party, is part of a coalition government in office since 2020 with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil would once have been viewed as center-right but have shifted left and embraced progressivism and globalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ireland’s main opposition party to the government, Sinn Féin, has been in lockstep with the establishment throughout the crisis, creating a void for a populist, nationalist movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result has been an explosion in novice candidates running for office in next month’s local and EU elections representing newly formed right-wing parties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, of course, unclear what kind of impact they can make. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, thrown into the mix is the fact that refugees and asylum seekers in Ireland are able to vote in local elections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Irish migrant group bragged on X Thursday that it had just registered 1,500 asylum seekers to vote, with all likely to vote for candidates to back their cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital requested comment from Ireland’s prime minister, justice minister and integration minister, as well as the Irish Refugee Council, but did not receive any responses. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A judge criticized for letting a teen who allegedly opened fire on a busy street out of jail before trial previously posted online about being &amp;quot;woke&amp;quot; and donated to a Soros group.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST ON FOX: &lt;/strong&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/washington-dc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Washington, D.C.,&lt;/a&gt; judge who released on bail a teenager accused of firing over two dozen rounds at a car full of people along a busy street has a social media presence filled with progressive activism and a financial link to progressive mega donor George Soros. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lloyd U. Nolan, Jr., a magistrate judge on the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, is in the spotlight this week after he ordered that 18-year-old Amonte Moody be released from custody before his trial despite accusations he sprayed a D.C. neighborhood with shots from an AR-15 while targeting a car carrying four people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolan’s online presence includes examples of progressive activism, including a post boasting about being &quot;woke,&quot; a post promoting Black Lives Matter and a post showing he donated to a fundraiser supporting a professor with ties to George Soros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Facebook post shows Nolan donated to Gideon’s Promise, a group founded in 2007 through a fellowship from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/george-soros&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;George Soros’&lt;/a&gt; Open Society Foundation on behalf of a professor named Jonathan Rapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/dc-business-owner-slams-city-leaders-out-control-crime-lack-courage-aggressive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC BUSINESS OWNER SLAMS CITY LEADERS FOR OUT-OF-CONTROL CRIME: &apos;LACK COURAGE&apos; TO &apos;BE MORE AGGRESSIVE&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapping, a professor at Atlanta’s John Marshall Law School, developed the venture, which is &quot;devoted to training and supporting public defenders across the Southeastern United States.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We envision a nation where every person has access to zealous, outstanding legal representation necessary to ensure ‘equal justice for all’ in the criminal justice arena,&quot; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gideonspromise.org/what-we-do/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gideon’s Promise website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our programs and partnerships are uniquely tailored to support and strengthen the efficacy of public defenders as a critical part of systemic criminal justice reform. Public defenders are frontline advocates for the accused in this country and we are committed to nurturing and developing their skills at every career level to produce fairer outcomes for America’s most vulnerable citizens.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-mayor-boasts-violent-crime-going-down-week-lashes-out-media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEM MAYOR BOASTS ABOUT VIOLENT CRIME GOING &apos;DOWN&apos; FOR A WEEK, LASHES OUT AT MEDIA FOR NOT COVERING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to Nolan for comment on the social media posts but did not receive a response. Shortly after the request for comment was sent, Nolan&apos;s Facebook page was set to private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolan concluded that Moody, who was charged with endangerment with a firearm, possession of a weapon and assault, was not a threat to the community and approved a request to release him on house arrest with a GPS monitor on May 3, WJLA-TV reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to release Moody on house arrest prompted outrage from many on social media. And prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington, D.C., requested an emergency hearing scheduled for May 22 to discuss the matter and potentially reverse it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The government presented evidence establishing probable cause that the defendant fired an AR-15 weapon approximately 26 times at a car driving away on a public street in the 1700 block of Independence Ave SE then dissembled the firearm and hid it away in a ceiling,&quot; the prosecutors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Despite the egregiousness of this conduct, the strength of the case, including video evidence depicting it and two identifications of the defendant as the shooter, and the statutory presumption in favor of detention pending trial, the Magistrate Judge released the defendant.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/in-court&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the D.C. court system&lt;/a&gt; told Fox News Digital all defendants &quot;have a presumption of innocence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In this matter — after hearing arguments from both sides and the arguments for detention — the judge determined that 24-hour home confinement on electronic monitoring with the education and social services already in place for the defendant that release, on these strict conditions did ‘ensure the safety of the defendant and the public,&apos;&quot; the spokesperson added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokesperson also told Fox News Digital the defense &quot;relied heavily&quot; on the fact that Moody had no prior encounters with law enforcement, and he was provided educational support and family and community resources.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Judge Nolan conducted a very thorough hearing … and spoke directly with defendant about the consequences of violating any portion of the release conditions,&quot; the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Top Senate Democrat joins growing chorus of lawmakers breaking from Biden on Israel</title>
                    
                    <description>Maryland Democratic Senator Ben Cardin joined a growing chorus of centrist, pro-Israel Democrats who have voiced disagreement with President Biden&amp;apos;s decision to withhold aid.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said Friday that military aid to Israel should continue in a departure from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;White House position&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Cardin said he disagreed with President Biden, who has threatened to withhold offensive aid from Israel if it proceeds with a ground invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where millions of Palestinians have sought refuge from the war. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While the most recent report regarding Israel under the NSM-20 has raised concerns, I agree with its assessment that Israel has not violated International Humanitarian Law and that military assistance to support Israel’s security remains in the U.S. interest and should continue,&quot; Cardin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In this regard, I differ with President Biden&apos;s recent decision,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-decision-pull-israel-weapons-shipment-kept-quiet-holocaust-remembrance-address-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN&apos;S DECISION TO PULL ISRAEL WEAPONS SHIPMENT KEPT QUIET UNTIL AFTER HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE ADDRESS: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardin&apos;s statement came in response to a State Department report released Friday, which raised &quot;serious concerns&quot; based on credible U.N. and non-governmental sources about alleged human rights violations by Israeli forces. The report documented credible allegations of human rights abuses by Israeli security forces, &quot;including arbitrary or unlawful killings, enforced disappearance, torture, and serious abuses in conflict.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/state-department&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt; report also said an estimated 34,700 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict with Israel since the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack, citing figures from the Gaza Ministry of Health. The report deemed the estimate &quot;credible&quot; but noted that the Hamas-controlled ministry does not distinguish between Hamas fighters and civilians in casualty counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department said it is &quot;reasonable to assess&quot; that U.S. defense articles &quot;have been used by Israeli security forces since October 7 in instances inconsistent with its [international humanitarian law] obligations or with established best practices for mitigating civilian harm.&quot; However, the report came short of accusing Israel of specific humanitarian law violations and noted that Hamas hides military targets behind civilian populations and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel&apos;s continued military operation in Gaza has created a political problem for Biden as left-wing anti-Israel agitators in the U.S. have grown increasingly upset at his support for Israel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/democrats-blow-up-biden-halting-weapons-shipments-israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEMOCRATS BLOW UP AT BIDEN FOR HALTING WEAPONS SHIPMENTS TO ISRAEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden signed off on a pause of a shipment of bombs to Israel that could be used in a potential assault on Rafah last week — but the White House National Security Council kept the decision quiet until after the president delivered a long-planned speech on Tuesday to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day, the Associated Press reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs, a senior U.S. administration official told the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;interview with CNN&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, Biden said he would halt some shipments of U.S. weapons to Israel if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered a major invasion of the city of Rafah, the last major Hamas stronghold in the Gaza Strip. It was the first time Biden said he was prepared to condition American weaponry on Israel’s action in the seven-month-long war launched in response to the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers,&quot; Biden told CNN’s Erin Burnett. &quot;I made it clear that if they go into Rafah – they haven’t gone in Rafah yet — if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities — that deal with that problem.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-vows-withhold-weapons-israel-netanyahu-goes-forward-rafah-invasion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His decision has prompted backlash from a growing chorus of pro-Israel Democratic lawmakers — now including Cardin — some of whom have suggested Biden&apos;s decision was motivated by politics and the upcoming election in November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I suspect it&apos;s pandering to the far left,&quot; Rep. Ritchie Tores, D-N.Y., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2024/05/09/biden-democrats-israel-weapons-rafah&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told Axios&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;It looks like election year politics was driving it. That&apos;s my impression.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Party is divided on Israel amid a massive wave of student protests at U.S. college and university campuses. Anti-Israel agitators have set up illegal encampments on at least 50 campuses and more than 2,800 have been arrested by police called to disperse the unlawful gatherings, according to the Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., an outspoken advocate for Israel&apos;s right to defend itself from Hamas, told Axios that he opposed Biden&apos;s pause on weapons shipments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-administration-confirms-paused-shipment-bombs-israel-over-opposition-operation-rafah&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN ADMINISTRATION CONFIRMS PAUSED SHIPMENT OF BOMBS TO ISRAEL OVER OPPOSITION TO OPERATION IN RAFAH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I strenuously disagree,&quot; Fetterman said. &quot;We have to stand with our key ally throughout all of this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., said security assistance to Israel should be &quot;unconditional&quot; while Israel faces threats from Iran and its proxy groups, like Hamas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The administration should not do anything that undermines Israel’s ability to defeat Hamas and address mounting threats across the region,&quot; she told Jewish Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., agreed that U.S. support for Israel should continue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don’t know what the president meant. I haven’t seen what the actual operation in Rafah is, but I certainly hope that we’ll continue to provide support militarily and diplomatically that Israel needs to defend itself,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; pushed back on the suggestion that Biden&apos;s decision on Israel was motivated by politics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The American people expect their presidents to have the guts to make hard national security decisions, and to put our safety, interests, principles, and alliances above politics,&quot; White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. &quot;That’s exactly what Joe Biden is doing.  He is standing with Israel as they fight the Hamas terrorists who committed the hideous October 7th attacks, and is making clear that how Israel defends itself matters because we do not want to see any more civilians killed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Joe Biden is the only president in our history to have ordered the American military to actively defend Israel from a foreign attack, and the only president to have literally stood with Israel — on Israeli soil — during wartime,&quot; Bates added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Jeffrey Clark and Danielle Wallace contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Roger Corman, independent filmmaker and Hollywood mentor, dead at 98</title>
                    
                    <description>Roger Corman, a man who worked in Hollywood for decades, often times with low budgets, died late last week at his southern California home, his family announced.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Roger Corman, a man known as a trailblazer in independent filmmaking and a mentor to many who worked with him, has died. He was 98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corman died at his Santa Monica, California, home on Thursday, according to a statement released Saturday by his wife and daughters obtained by The Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corman, known as &quot;King of the Bs&quot; helped turn out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;low-budget classics&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; and &quot;Attack of the Crab Monsters.&quot; He gave many Hollywood actors and producers their first breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he acknowledged the &quot;many constraints&quot; working on low-budget films during a 2007 documentary about Val Lewton, the 1940s director of &quot;Cat People&quot; and other underground classics, he said they also allow more creativity and experimentation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/blue-bloods-star-tom-selleck-shares-who-left-him-starstruck&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&apos;BLUE BLOODS&apos; STAR TOM SELLECK SHARES WHO LEFT HIM STARSTRUCK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corman&apos;s career as a producer and director started in 1955, where he did B-movies &quot;Black Scorpion,&quot; &quot;Bucket of Blood&quot; and &quot;Bloody Mama.&quot; He hired now well-known filmmakers Ron Howard, James Cameron and Martin Scorsese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corman&apos;s B-movie directors were given minuscule budgets and often told to finish their films in as little as five days. When Howard, who would go on to win a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;best director Oscar&lt;/a&gt; for &quot;A Beautiful Mind,&quot; pleaded for an extra half day to reshoot a scene in 1977 for &quot;Grand Theft Auto,&quot; Corman told him, &quot;Ron, you can come back if you want, but nobody else will be there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/matthew-mcconaughey-taught-manners-sent-back-bed-grumpy-breakfast&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY ON HOW MOM TAUGHT HIM MANNERS, SENT HIM BACK TO BED IF HE WAS &apos;GRUMPY&apos; AT BREAKFAST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A-list actor Jack Nicholson made his film debut as the title character in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/old-hollywood&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;1958 Corman quickie,&lt;/a&gt; &quot;The Cry Baby Killer,&quot; and stayed with the company for biker, horror and action films, writing and producing some of them. One of Nicholson&apos;s most well-known roles came in the 1980 horror film &quot;The Shining.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corman was born in Detroit and raised in the not &quot;affluent section&quot; of Beverly Hills, he once said. He attended Stanford University, earning a degree in engineering, and arrived in Hollywood after three years in the Navy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corman got his start as a messenger boy for 20th Century-Fox, eventually graduating to story analyst. After quitting the business briefly to study English literature for a term at Oxford University, he returned to Hollywood and launched his career as a movie producer and director. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1964, he married Julie Halloran, a UCLA graduate who also became a producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is survived by his wife, Julie, and children Catherine, Roger, Brian and Mary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was generous, open-hearted and kind to all those who knew him,&quot; the family statement about his death said. &quot;When asked how he would like to be remembered, he said, ‘I was a filmmaker, just that.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Joe Manchin says Donald Trump can win, wants to make the GOP ‘grand again’</title>
                    
                    <description>Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., spoke to &amp;quot;One Nation&amp;quot; about former President Trump&amp;apos;s chances at re-election in November, the state of the GOP and Israeli aid.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Democratic senator told Fox News &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-panelists-argue-stormy-daniels-michael-cohen-should-given-gag-order-too-seems-fair&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;former President Trump can win&lt;/a&gt; in November and said the Republican Party needs to be made &quot;grand again&quot; while the Democratic Party must be made &quot;responsible again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who announced in November that he will not seek re-election, said he &quot;most certainly&quot; believes Trump can achieve a victory in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2024 election&lt;/a&gt;. West Virginia will vote in its primary election Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-administration-puts-hold-us-ammunition-shipment-israel-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN ADMINISTRATION PUTS HOLD ON US AMMUNITION SHIPMENT TO ISRAEL: REPORT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The red state senator told &quot;One Nation&quot; host Brian Kilmeade on Saturday he comes from an area of &quot;pragmatic,&quot; &quot;hardworking people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They don&apos;t want government jumping on your back, telling you what to do and making it harder for you. They believe in freedom and democracy,&quot; he said. &quot;They believe in all of that. They believe in giving a helping hand, but they believe you ought to get off your butt and do something sometimes.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawmaker, who rejected the idea of being a &quot;Washington Democrat,&quot; expressed concern about the direction of both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/nj-voters-trump-flip-state-red-despite-legal-woes-momentum&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;political parties&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The parties have gone so extreme, and somehow we&apos;ve got to bring the Grand Old Party — make it grand again — and make the Democrat Party responsible again,&quot; he said. &quot;I think they both lost their ways, and they&apos;re just listening to their own chatter here in Washington, but none of this makes sense. We don&apos;t live our lives like this.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manchin said he&apos;s spoken to President Biden about the direction the nation is heading in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve told the president, I said, &apos;You&apos;ve got to be careful,&apos;&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of these bills and a lot of the direction, the executive orders, people that came from the generation that I&apos;ve come from and that you&apos;ve come from is basically John Kennedy asking not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. We continue down this path, and people are starting to ask, ‘How much more can my country do for me?’ That&apos;s not who we are. It&apos;s not how we have the country we do, and it&apos;s not what I&apos;m willing to sit back and watch it be taken away. So, I&apos;m going to be fighting for basically how much more can I do for my country, and I appreciate what my country has done for me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senator also weighed in on the country&apos;s response to the Israel-Hamas war and &quot;misinformation&quot; that is leading people to declare their &quot;allegiance and support for a terrorist organization like Hamas.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I… lived through the Vietnam time period when we saw an awful lot of protests, but the protests I saw back then, whether I agreed or disagreed, the protests I saw were trying to make America better. These protests are trying to basically tear down the fabric of America, and there&apos;s no way that we should tolerate it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manchin also said he had an encounter with Cindy McCain, widow of the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and that she told him last week she had 30 trucks &quot;full of food&quot; that were &quot;hijacked.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;… she says, &apos;I had 30 trucks full of food — 30 trailer trucks that were hijacked by Hamas. Their own people — they wouldn&apos;t let them feed their own people.&apos;&quot; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>West Coast exodus drives surprising political effect in red state, and it&apos;s not a liberal shift</title>
                    
                    <description>As California, Washington and Oregon families flock to Idaho, many locals fear their new neighbors will change the culture — and politics — of their state.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story is the third in a series examining the mass-migration of West Coast residents to Idaho. Read &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/red-state-expat-community-families-fleeing-western-liberal-bastions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;parts one&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/americans-fleeing-west-coast-deep-red-state-freedom-friendliness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SANDPOINT, Idaho — A snarky saying appeared on local bumper stickers in the early 1990s as droves of Californians moved to North Idaho: &quot;Welcome to Idaho. Now go home.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Don’t California my Idaho&quot; sentiment remains alive and well 30 years later as tens of thousands of West Coast residents seek refuge in the Gem State. Recent transplants can be some of the fiercest critics of new residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As soon as we signed the mortgage, we’re like, ‘That’s it. No more Oregonians. Build the wall,’&quot; joked Nick Kostenborder, who moved &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/portland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;from Portland&lt;/a&gt; to Sandpoint in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/why-idaho-closed-loophole-allow-state-agencies-steal-residents-home-equity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY IDAHO JUST CLOSED A LOOPHOLE THAT WOULD ALLOW STATE AGENCIES TO STEAL RESIDENTS’ HOME EQUITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More seriously, though, he said he understands locals’ concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You should be suspicious of newcomers,&quot; Kostenborder said. &quot;I&apos;ll prove to you that I&apos;m not here to turn it into Portland.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idaho is one of the fastest-growing states in the country, according to recent census data, with most of the increase coming not from births, but from West Coast movers. The rapid population gains have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewdepietro/2023/10/23/will-the-boise-housing-market-crash/?sh=4ebdc67d4243&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ballooned housing prices&lt;/a&gt; and strained inventory, while also sparking fears among conservative Idahoans that their new neighbors will bring liberal policies across the state line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the politics front, however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/thousands-blue-state-residents-flock-idaho-bringing-conservative-politics-with-data&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;voter registration data&lt;/a&gt; suggests Gem State Republicans have nothing to fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Politically, we are not changing anything,&quot; Bonner County Commissioner Luke Omodt said. &quot;Idaho is actually growing redder.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 analysis of voters who moved in from other states depicts a red wave crashing down on Idaho. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Californians&lt;/a&gt; led the pack, with 75% registering as Republicans and a mere 10% registering as Democrats. More than 60% of Washington and Oregon transplants who registered to vote in Idaho did so as Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They feel like they&apos;re running for their lives away from oppressive laws and policies in these other states,&quot; said Coeur d’Alene-based real estate agent Seth Horst, a former California police officer who moved to Idaho in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/crisis-northwest-citys-battle-homelessness-dire-effects-nation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CRISIS IN THE NORTHWEST: CITY&apos;S BATTLE AGAINST HOMELESSNESS COULD HAVE DIRE EFFECTS FOR THE NATION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Educating potential movers about the state&apos;s culture has become part of the job for Horst, who runs a podcast and YouTube channel called Residing in North Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We get some pushback from locals and people that don&apos;t want others moving here,&quot; Horst said. &quot;But [North Idaho is] not a secret anymore. … What&apos;s important right now is that people are educated because we want the right people moving here. We want people whose values match and don&apos;t want to come here and change the way of life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trent Grandstaff, founder of the Living Life in North Idaho realty group, recalled one prospective mover who wanted to &quot;help fix Idaho&quot; with liberal values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I said, ‘For your sake, don’t do that. Nobody wants that,’&quot; Grandstaff said. &quot;People are changing their entire lives, spending so much money to get out of the liberal-run cities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/seattle-area-officials-want-no-locks-no-cells-juvenile-offenders-amid-rise-teen-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEATTLE-AREA OFFICIALS WANT &apos;NO LOCKS, NO CELLS&apos; FOR JUVENILE OFFENDERS AMID RISE IN TEEN CRIME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the three states driving Idaho’s growth, Washington is the only one to avoid overall population dips. California’s decreased by nearly half a million between 2018 and 2023, according to Census Bureau data, while Oregon’s dropped in 2022 for the first time in nearly 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&apos;s a sign of how unique and critical this moment is,&quot; Portland City Commissioner and mayoral candidate Mingus Mapps &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/crisis-northwest-voters-beyond-turning-point-decades-progressive-politics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;previously told Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;We have to get this right, and the things that we need to be focusing in on are houselessness, public safety and economic vitality.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And West Coast states may be getting even bluer with so many of their conservatives fleeing to Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From May 2020 to March of this year, Oregon&apos;s Multnomah County lost more than 3,700 GOP voters, around 6% of its total Republicans. Neighboring Washington County shed around 7,400 Republicans and gained more than 2,000 Democrats during the same period, according to data from the secretary of state&apos;s office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republicans could have simply re-registered as Democrats or with another party, but it’s notable that the losses were overwhelmingly &quot;on one side of the ledger,&quot; according to John Horvick of DHM Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That suggests to me that our more conservative friends and Multnomah County Republican neighbors have decided to go somewhere else,&quot; he said. &quot;Whether it&apos;s across the river to Clark County in Washington or over to Idaho.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/crisis-northwest-voters-beyond-turning-point-decades-progressive-politics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CRISIS IN NORTHWEST: ARE VOTERS &apos;BEYOND A TURNING POINT&apos; AFTER DECADES OF PROGRESSIVE POLITICS?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryan Zielinski isn’t worried about the impact on states like Oregon and Washington, his former home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&apos;s their loss,&quot; said Zielinski, who moved to Idaho last June and recently opened a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/second-amendment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;gun store&lt;/a&gt; in Post Falls. &quot;If high net-worth, high-productivity individuals and families want to leave an oppressive state … that can only benefit Idaho as a state. It can only hurt Washington, Oregon, California.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coeur d’Alene Mayor Jim Hammond has lived in North Idaho for half a century. He’s seen a lot of changes in that time, but lately the biggest difference is what he &lt;i&gt;doesn’t &lt;/i&gt;see: familiar faces. He used to budget extra time during grocery store runs or Chamber of Commerce events because he would run into so many people he knew. Now, he doesn’t know the name of everyone he passes in town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am amazed by that,&quot; said Hammond, who also served as a Republican state senator from 2006 to 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hammond sees both positives and negatives in North Idaho’s rapid growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If we’re big enough that we can support businesses … we strengthen our own economy,&quot; he said. &quot;We’re not going somewhere else to shop. We’re not going somewhere else for work. We’re doing that all within our community, and that means all those funds stay within our community.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/digital-originals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearby, Sandpoint began as a timber town, but had to pivot when the logging industry faded. The proximity of Lake Pend Oreille and Schweitzer Mountain made it a natural outdoor recreation destination. Since tourism jobs are largely seasonal and low paying, Mayor Jeremy Grimm said the region has tried to attract other businesses, like tech companies and manufacturers, billing itself as a perfect location to work and play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When you could locate your business … in an urban center or in a place like Sandpoint, it&apos;s pretty easy for a CEO or the owner of those companies to make that choice,&quot; Grimm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that strategy may have worked too well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was easy to bring up companies from, say, California because the cost of living was so much lower here and, at the time, the cost of housing was much lower,&quot; Hammond said. Now, housing prices are &quot;not nearly as competitive&quot; as they once were, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grimm spoke to Fox News Digital from a new development on the north side of town, where new houses on lots as small as 5,200 square feet are listed for $600,000 to $800,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Although we have a very diverse economy with aerospace and food manufacturing and medical device manufacturing, at the end of the day, a lot of those jobs don&apos;t support what it takes to buy a house like this,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/crisis-northwest-homeschooling-mom-documenting-portlands-destruction&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CRISIS IN THE NORTHWEST: THE HOMESCHOOLING MOM DOCUMENTING PORTLAND&apos;S &apos;DESTRUCTION&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People born in Idaho are getting priced out of their hometowns, said Daniel Hanson, whose family has lived in the Sandpoint area for more than 100 years. He and his wife built an approximately $500,000 home on a small parcel in 2020. Their latest tax assessment values the home at $1.3 million, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s unaffordable,&quot; Hanson told Fox News. &quot;I fear for my children being able to afford a home remotely close to our area.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grimm hopes a surge in new inventory will help. Developers are in the process of building around 1,200 new housing units in the city of about 10,000 people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hopefully that will allow our businesses to thrive [and] attract quality employees,&quot; he said, &quot;because we certainly want anyone who wants to move a business here to do that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idaho&apos;s population growth has cooled somewhat since the nearly 3% spike in 2020. But Horst still hears from frustrated West Coast families almost every day who say they want to move to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/idaho&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Gem State&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The more that we see these ridiculous policies happening in other states, good people who are like, ‘We’ve had enough,&apos; they are getting pushed to the limit,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as some lifetime residents bristle at the rapid growth, Omodt said he hopes the &quot;newcomers and the old-timers alike&quot; can work together to preserve the quality of life he experienced growing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People struggle when the field next door to them turns into houses,&quot; he said. &quot;But that&apos;s also brought jobs. It&apos;s brought families, it&apos;s brought new churches, increased libraries … When we go and we see a new doctor, we&apos;re grateful that we have that new technology and care.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Balance of power: Senate GOP&apos;s campaign chair cautiously optimistic about retaking majority in 2024 elections</title>
                    
                    <description>Sen. Steve Daines of Montana is laying down the law as he steers the Senate GOP campaign committee. Can he do what the GOP failed to do two years ago and win back the Senate majority?</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Senate Republican campaign chief Steve Daines is tempering any talk of a red wave this autumn leading to a large &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/republicans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GOP majority&lt;/a&gt; in the chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want 51. That’s the majority,&quot; the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) told Fox News Digital this week when asked what he&apos;s aiming for in November&apos;s elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats control the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.S. Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; 51-49, but Republicans are looking at a favorable Senate map this year, with Democrats defending 23 of the 34 seats up for grabs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of those seats are in red states that former President Trump carried in 2020 — Ohio, Montana and West Virginia, where Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin is not running for re-election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-of-race-six-key-senate-seats-republicans-look-flip-2024&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 KEY SENATE SEATS REPUBLICANS AIM TO FLIP IN NOVEMBER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The first state that we know that we’re going to win at this point is West Virginia,&quot; Danies said. &quot;There’s one pickup seat right there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five more Democrat-held seats are in key general election battleground states. Democrats are also defending an open seat in blue Maryland, where popular former two-term Republican Gov. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/larry-hogan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Larry Hogan&lt;/a&gt; is running for the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We like where Larry’s at. We know that’s going to be a tough race because Maryland is a blue state, but it’s a Hogan state first and foremost,&quot; Daines argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/progressive-champion-and-two-time-presidential-candidate-sen-bernie-sanders-announces-re-election-bid&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BERNIE SANDERS MAKES A MAJOR DECISION ABOUT HIS FUTURE IN THE SENATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the map favors the GOP, Daines, the junior senator from Montana, is on the same page as longtime Senate Republican leader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mitch-mcconnell&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mitch McConnell&lt;/a&gt;, who also appears to be pouring cold water on hopes of sweeping victories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he&apos;s striking a very different tone than his predecessor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/sen-rick-scott&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sen. Rick Scott &lt;/a&gt;of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott predicted a 55-seat majority would come out of the 2022 midterms, but he fell far short as Republicans faced ballot box setbacks in key contests and failed to win back the Senate majority they lost in the 2020 cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As we looked at the results of ’22, nobody was happy,&quot; Daines said in a sitdown interview at his office at the NRSC. &quot;Everybody likes winning. Nobody likes to lose. We looked first and foremost at a strategy that would start with finding candidates that could win not just primary elections but general elections.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daines made news in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/incoming-senate-gop-campaign-chair-daines-pledges-do-whatever-takes-win&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox Digital interview&lt;/a&gt; in December 2022 as he was coming onboard as NRSC chair. The senator vowed to do &quot;whatever it takes to make sure we have a Republican majority.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that included having the NRSC get involved in contested GOP primaries, which marked a significant change from his predecessor on the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward a year and a half, and Daines says &quot;we’re positioned now in most of these states with candidates that not only can win primaries but are making every general election race right now competitive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of the blame for 2022&apos;s GOP Senate election setbacks was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;directed at Trump,&lt;/a&gt; who shaped key primary battles. In some of the races, the nominees either supported or begrudgingly disavowed Trump&apos;s repeated re-litigating of his 2020 election defeat to President Biden and his unproven claims his loss was due to a &quot;rigged&quot; and &quot;stolen&quot; election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herschel Walker in Georgia, Blake Masters in Arizona, Adam Laxalt in Nevada and Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, who won their primaries due in part to Trump’s endorsements and support, all went down in defeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been a different story in 2024, with Trump, the NRSC and McConnell mostly on the same page when it comes Senate race recruitments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daines credits his &quot;strong productive working relationship, a friendship,&quot; he has with Trump, which has bridged the still-lingering intra-party divide between the former president and McConnell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;From the very beginning, the president and I have worked very closely, very carefully, finding candidates that we agree on, that are the best candidates that can not only win primaries but general elections,&quot; he noted. &quot;We compare notes... there’s trust built there, constructive dialogue. We text and speak to each other frequently ... as we shape the Senate map for 2024.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Daines hasn&apos;t been able to totally avoid competitive and contentious primaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump-supported Bernie Moreno earlier this year won a combustible nomination battle in Ohio, although the contest wasn&apos;t as bitter as the 2022 GOP Senate primary slugfest in the Buckeye State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Republican Senate primaries are heating up in Michigan and Nevada, where Trump and the NRSC are once again backing the same candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Nevada, Sam Brown, a former Army officer who was severely injured in the Afghanistan war, has the backing of the NRSC. But former Trump Ambassador to Iceland Jeff Gunter has vowed to spend &quot;whatever it takes&quot; to defeat Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Michigan, wealthy investor and entrepreneur Sandy Pensler is spending big bucks on a major ad blitz as he takes aim at former Rep. Mike Rogers, the one-time FBI agent and former House Intelligence Committee chair who is endorsed by Trump and supported by the NRSC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He has the full, complete, 100% endorsement and support of President Trump, of the NRSC, and that’s why Mike Rogers will win that primary,&quot; Daines emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rival Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee argues that stories about the NRSC&apos;s successes so far this cycle may have been prematurely written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Senate Republicans’ roster of recruits is reeling from a series of reports uncovering their lies about their biographies, vulnerabilities tied to their finances and a lifetime of toxic statements and policy positions,&quot; DSCC spokesperson Tommy Garcia argued in a statement to Fox News. &quot;Meanwhile, their primaries in states like Nevada and Michigan are erupting in chaos. The NRSC’s big bet to back a bunch of unvetted carpetbaggers is looking worse by the day.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the Democrats&apos; criticism, Daines remains optimistic — and one reason is President Biden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daines says having Biden at the top of the Democrats&apos; ticket this autumn is making his job easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daines argues Democrats &quot;have got to really combat the incredible headwinds they will face with a president who is so unpopular. Joe Biden makes Jimmy Carter look like a superstar.
