                    <description>A son believed to be a suspect in Mother’s Day massacre was found and shot dead after opening fire on law enforcement officers hundreds of miles away.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Mother’s Day massacre left a woman and two of her daughters dead in Mississippi, officials said. The suspect died later hundreds of miles away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Ridgeland Police Department, a man later identified as Ivory James Welch III, was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;lead &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;suspect &lt;/a&gt;in the death of his mother and two sisters when he fled town and the state, getting as far as Arizona before he was shot dead in a shootout with state troopers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ridgeland &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Police &lt;/a&gt;Chief Brian Myers says officers received a call about the triple homicide around 3:30 p.m. Sunday at a home on Old Canton Road in Ridgeland, WLBT reported. He identified the victims as Ida Thomas Welch, 76, Vicky Renee Welch, 56, and Crystal Lynn Welch, 42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This horrific event will have a lasting effect on this family, the officers involved in this investigation as well as our brothers in Arizona law enforcement,&quot; the police chief said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/mothers-day-one-liners-life-advice-real-moms&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOTHER&apos;S DAY: THE BEST ONE-LINERS AND LIFE ADVICE I&apos;VE EVER GOTTEN FROM MOM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mississippi officers were subsequently notified that their suspect was killed in Arizona on Monday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the police chief, an arrest warrant for Welch was obtained and the U.S. Marshals Task Force began searching for him. He was ultimately located by Arizona Department of Public Safety troopers between Morenci and Clifton, according to AZFamily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officers from the Greenlee County Sheriff’s Office and the Clifton Police Department assisted in the Arizona pursuit, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once found by the law enforcement officers, a gunfight ensued, according to Myers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Arizona State Troopers attempted to apprehend Welch and he fired upon the troopers and was fatally wounded in the gunfight,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-mom-dies-saving-drowning-daughter-just-before-mothers-day-sheriff&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CALIFORNIA MOM DIES SAVING DROWNING DAUGHTER JUST BEFORE MOTHER&apos;S DAY: SHERIFF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myers added: &quot;This investigation is a great example of how teamwork in law enforcement, as well as a great relationship with our media outlets, affords us swift justice for a grieving family.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/mississippi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mississippi ACLU&lt;/a&gt; released a statement remembering Crystal Welch, who served as Board President since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I just cannot process today’s news,&quot; Executive Director Jarvis Dortch said. &quot;Crystal was a great friend and since 2023, she was an enthusiastic leader of the ACLU of Mississippi Board of Directors.  She was always asking what more she could do to support our team and our work. Our staff and board will forever be grateful for her commitment to equality and justice. Her passion for life, infectious spirit and enthusiasm will be missed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It continued: &quot;On behalf of ACLU of Mississippi, I would like to express our heartfelt condolences to Crystal’s family during this unthinkable time. We urge the community to join us in sending prayers to the Welch family.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Crystal was just a true delight. She was just a superwoman. She was a fun, loving intellectual. Very passionate about her work,&quot; her friend, Colendula Green, told AZFamily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities have not identified a motive for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;fatal shootings.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He may have been upset about a funeral and his birthday, which was on Friday,&quot; Chief Myers said, per AZFamily.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>GREG GUTFELD: There&apos;s no shortage of parasites out there living off the brains of others</title>
                    
                    <description>&amp;quot;Gutfeld!&amp;quot; host Greg Gutfeld draws inspiration from RFK Jr.&amp;apos;s claim a worm once ate his brain to break down how &amp;quot;brain worms&amp;quot; are burrowing their way into America&amp;apos;s culture.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As you probably heard, RFK Jr., claims that a worm once ate part of his brain. Lucky for him, he recovered. And lucky for the brain eating worm that he didn&apos;t pick Joe instead, or he would have starved to death. But this whole worm in your brain thing got me thinking that there&apos;s no shortage of parasites out there living off the brains of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most obvious are the campus occupiers who have segued into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/jerry-seinfeld-mocks-harvard-university-during-duke-commencement-speech&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ruining college graduation ceremonies&lt;/a&gt; across America. The worm in these heads of these kids sounds like a cross between Karl Marx and someone with even worse hair, Joy Reid. Which explains the united front among communists, anarchists, BLM, Antifa and the Hamas-holes. Also climate change hoaxers. Yep, we&apos;ve seen Greta&apos;s new gig now, since the globe didn&apos;t burn up like she said. So how will she get her screen time? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/columbia-university-student-handcuffs-rips-diploma-commencement-stage-protest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY STUDENT IN HANDCUFFS RIPS UP DIPLOMA ON COMMENCEMENT STAGE IN ACT OF PROTEST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But their common denominator is clear: We want to destroy the West and what we&apos;re going to offer you instead is far worse. To them, it&apos;s like replacing Jon Hamm with a ham. Here is video of Queers for Palestine, who have as much in common with Hamas as Kat does with members of Odor Eaters Anonymous, but the Queers for Palestine do have one thing in common with Hamas, irrational hate. They tried to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/anti-israel-agitators-arrested-near-disney-world-after-creating-traffic-nightmare&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;stop traffic at Walt Disney World&lt;/a&gt; in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;VIDEO&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they can&apos;t think they got a worm. Thankfully, Florida turned these Queers for Palestine into inmates for Palestine in minutes. Turns out you can arrest people blocking the road quickly if you arrest people for blocking the road quickly. And if these Queers for Palestine think that&apos;s bad, imagine what would happen if they ever met Hamas. Hamas loves to party with the LGBTQ community. First, they&apos;ll raise the roof. Then they throw them off it, but that&apos;s actual enforcement. Oh. Thank you. But that&apos;s actual enforcement without contemplating root causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/unc-chapel-hill-board-votes-dismantle-dei-programs-use-funds-campus-police-anti-israel-protests&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNC CHAPEL HILL BOARD VOTES TO DISMANTLE DEI PROGRAMS, USE FUNDS ON CAMPUS POLICE AFTER ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shouldn&apos;t civilization now be collapsing like Jerrold Nadler during a stress test? Up next, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, whose country is pushing the online harms bill, which criminalizes what they call hate speech. What is hate speech in Canada, you ask? It&apos;s any speech that might make a protected group uncomfortable. If that net got any wider, it could catch Whoopi Goldberg&apos;s lunch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is this law retroactive? What if you tweeted problematic stuff that&apos;s still out there? What if you once shared a controversial video? Or what if you have an embarrassingly racist photo lying around and you happen to be prime minister of Canada? The law is vague, but what&apos;s scary is that if you are likely to re-offend, you could be locked up indefinitely going forward. All thanks to Trudeau, he is rapidly becoming our hemisphere&apos;s Kim Jong Un. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out the apple doesn&apos;t fall far from the tree, if your mom bangs Castro. And what if, as an American, you mocked or criticized a Canadian? Could you be extradited to Canada to face charges? Well, let&apos;s try it out on three, we&apos;re going to say: Hey Justin, you suck. One. Two. Three. Hey Justin, you suck! Congrats, everyone. You are now safer vacationing in Mexico. But think about it, could you go to jail in Canada for sharing a video about a certain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/gutfeld-canadian-teacher-wearing-prosthetic-breasts-gender-affirming-surgeries-children&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Canadian shop teacher&lt;/a&gt;? Just for the record, that whole thing that wasn&apos;t me, that was all Kat&apos;s idea and Tyrus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/jewish-students-across-us-blame-dei-faculty-anti-israel-protests-wasting-tuition-dollars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JEWISH STUDENTS ACROSS THE US BLAME DEI, FACULTY FOR ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS: &apos;WASTING MY TUITION DOLLARS&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TYRUS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;---- You, Greg.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arrest the Black guy. That usually works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TYRUS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Come get me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And go easy on Kat, she&apos;s cold anywhere north of Honduras. Here&apos;s another clear example of a voracious brain worm that must be on its second helping by now, an Irish Eurovision contestant crying over the Israeli contestant advancing to the finals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;VIDEO&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who knew hemorrhoids could talk? Now, perhaps this creature was probably a nice girl long ago, raised by nice parents, but look at her now. She&apos;s got more hate in her than I do for &quot;Fox &amp;amp; Friends.&quot; And now she&apos;s targeting a truly normal, healthy Israeli contestant for being, well, normal and healthy from Israel, but perhaps the biggest idiocy is that this moron thinks blind, ignorant antisemitism is punk. Sorry, it&apos;s not punk when the competition judges align with you. Nope, you&apos;re about as edgy as a stick of butter at room temperature or what Joy Behar calls breakfast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton-slammed-fellow-democrat-dismissive-remarks-about-anti-israel-protesters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HILLARY CLINTON SLAMMED BY FELLOW DEMOCRAT FOR &apos;DISMISSIVE&apos; REMARKS ABOUT ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So as the brain worms continue to burrow their way into our culture and our kids, just remember they all have a common ancestor. You can call it progressivism or cultural Marxism, whatever it is, you got to ask, how did it get there? I mean, look who&apos;s acting crazy today and who isn&apos;t and that should tell you something. True, there are a few zanies on the right, but that bubbles up from below. This mass hysteria on the left is purely top down. It comes from professors, the media, the hard left organizations that have money and no scruples. This isn&apos;t QAnon, it&apos;s CNN, MSNBC, The Washington Post, Media Matters and the like. That&apos;s why we don&apos;t have the worm. They do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They&apos;re getting it in their diet, but us, we don&apos;t eat that ----, but whatever you call the worms, parents better sit quietly, especially on campus or if you live in Canada. In the meantime, as the adults in the room, let&apos;s take a lesson from Florida and convey a simple message to these students, professors, and the media, and yes, the Canadian PM, for God&apos;s sakes, grow up! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You and your worms are destroying the institutions that made the West the most successful civilization ever. And it won&apos;t stop there, because eventually every parasite kills its host. But who knows? By the looks of this lot, they&apos;re so inedible the worms might be looking for a better meal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge detonated to help free ship from Port of Baltimore</title>
                    
                    <description>Crews used explosives on Monday to break apart a section of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore that was still sitting on top of the container ship Dali.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Crews used carefully placed explosives on Monday to break apart a large span of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/maryland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baltimore, Maryland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and send the mangled metal crashing into the water below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video of the demolition showed the explosives detonating, with flashes of fire followed by a loud boom and a black plume of smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The steel truss then broke apart, falling away from the grounded Dali container ship, and into the water. As the metal crashed into the Patapsco River, a big wave of water crashed onto the bow of the ship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it is not known whether the ship has been freed from the mangled mess, detonating the largest remaining section sitting across its bow is a major step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/baltimore-key-bridge-collapse-bodycam-video-captures-law-enforcements-confusion-moments-after-disaster&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BALTIMORE KEY BRIDGE COLLAPSE: BODYCAM VIDEO CAPTURES LAW ENFORCEMENT&apos;S CONFUSION MOMENTS AFTER DISASTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dali has been stuck in the wreckage since March 26, when it lost power and crashed into a support column underneath the Key Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;catastrophe killed six&lt;/a&gt; construction workers and put a freeze on most maritime traffic in and out of Baltimore’s busy port.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeing the ship from the bridge debris will ultimately lead to the Dali being refloated before moving it out of the way to restore traffic through the port. Once opened back up, thousands of dockworkers, truckers and business owners should see relief as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/newsedge/business&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;business slowly returns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/body-sixth-victim-baltimore-key-bridge-collapse-pulled-from-water&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BODY OF SIXTH VICTIM IN BALTIMORE KEY BRIDGE COLLAPSE PULLED FROM WATER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to officials, the detonation of explosives went as planned. Now, crews will assess the remaining pieces of bridge on the container ship’s bow then ensure anything underwater is not preventing the ship from being floated and moved out of the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s a lot like peeling back an onion,&quot; Lt. Gen. Scott Spellmon of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials still expect to refloat the ship within the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/baltimore-bridge-collapse-maryland-governor-conditions-currently-unsafe-rescue-divers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MARYLAND GOVERNOR SAYS CONDITIONS ARE ‘UNSAFE’ FOR RESCUE DIVERS AFTER BRIDGE COLLAPSE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This was a very big milestone for our progression forward,&quot; Col. Estee Pinchasin, Baltimore District Commander for the Army Corps of Engineers said, adding she did not expect any other explosives to be used in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 21-member crew of the Dali has not been able to leave the ship since the disaster on March 26. In fact, the crew members remained on the ship during Monday’s detonation and were reported safe without injuries after the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Transportation Safety Board and FBI are investigating what led to the bridge collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the crash occurred, the crew of the Dali sent out a mayday call reporting they lost power and did not have control of the ship’s steering system. Minutes later, the ship struck a bridge support, sending the structure crashing down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>An Army officer assigned to the Defense Intelligence Agency has resigned in protest over the United States’ continued military support for Israel.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;A U.S. Army officer&lt;/a&gt; assigned to the Defense Intelligence Agency resigned from his position in protest over the United States&apos; support of Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Army confirmed to Fox News that Maj. Harrison Mann requested to resign from his position in November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The policy that has never been far from my mind the last 6 months is nearly the unqualified support for the government of Israel, which has enabled and empowered the killing and starvation of tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians,&quot; Mann wrote on his LinkedIn page recently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is clear that this week, some of you will still be asked to provide support — directly or indirectly — to the Israeli military as it conducts operations into Rafah and elsewhere in Gaza. I am sharing it now in the hope that you too will discover you are not alone, you are not voiceless, and you are not powerless,&quot; Mann continued in his post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/state-department-criticizes-israels-attempts-mitigating-civilian-harm-gaza-war-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STATE DEPARTMENT CRITICIZES ISRAEL’S ATTEMPTS AT ‘MITIGATING CIVILIAN HARM’ IN GAZA WAR: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a statement from the U.S. Army Public Affairs, Mann was commissioned into the Army in 2011 as an Infantry Officer and is currently assigned to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Bolling AFB as a Foreign Area Officer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Army said Mann was deployed to Tunisia, Bahrain, Kuwait and South Korea during his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Maj. Harrison Mann actually requested an unqualified resignation from his commission on Nov. 29, 2023.  An unqualified resignation is a voluntary action for officers to be discharged from service and can be requested for any reason after completion of service obligations,&quot; a statement from U.S. Army Public Affairs read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mann&apos;s request to resign, which was first reported by the New York Times, was approved in January and will go into effect on June 3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-considers-accepting-palestinians-gaza-refugees-amid-israel-hamas-war&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHITE HOUSE CONSIDERS ACCEPTING SOME PALESTINIANS FROM GAZA AS REFUGEES AMID ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mann&apos;s resignation comes as the U.S. State Department on Friday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;criticized Israel’s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; use of U.S-supplied arms in a way that may be &quot;inconsistent&quot; in &quot;mitigating civilian harm&quot; in the war in Gaza. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report obtained by Fox News Digital, which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sent to Congress&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, admitted that &quot;Israel has had to confront an extraordinary military challenge: Hamas has embedded itself deliberately within and underneath the civilian population to use civilians as human shields.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report added that &quot;it is often difficult to determine facts on the ground in an active war zone of this nature and the presence of legitimate military targets across Gaza.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 35,000 Palestinians have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense/wars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;killed in the conflict,&lt;/a&gt; including many women and children, according to the Palestinian government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Brie Stimson contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>The Carter County Sheriff&amp;apos;s Office announced that five suspects have been arrested in connection to an attempted murder case that took place in August 2023.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Authorities in Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that five people were arrested over the weekend on multiple charges in connection to an attempted murder that occurred in August 2023, that left the victim with a skull fracture during an attack with a baseball bat and skillet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Carter County Sheriff&apos;s Office announced that the charges against the five suspects stem from an investigation into an incident on August 19, 2023, when deputies responded to a report of an assault where a 29-year-old victim was suffering from an apparent head injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deputies stated the male victim was unable to speak with them at that time due to the severity of his injuries and he was transported to an area hospital for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the investigation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;deputies said&lt;/a&gt; they spoke to members of the victim’s family who stated they had received a call from the victim who sounded like he was in distress, and he asked them to come help him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/nyc-subway-slasher-apprehended-alleged-assault-11-year-old-girl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NYC SUBWAY SLASHER APPREHENDED AFTER ALLEGED ASSAULT ON 11-YEAR-OLD GIRL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victim’s mother told deputies the victim stated he had been attacked by several subjects and stated they used a baseball bat, brass knuckles, and a cast iron skillet to assault him. The family members also provided deputies with the names of the individuals the victim identified as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the people who attacked him.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deputies responded to the boat ramp where the incident took place and stated that they located the victim’s vehicle, and discovered a puddle of blood and a broken cast iron skillet next to the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After processing the scene, deputies were informed by medical staff that the victim had suffered a skull fracture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/st-louis-teen-brutally-beaten-viral-attack-breathing-own-stable-condition-reports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ST. LOUIS TEEN WHO WAS BRUTALLY BEATEN IN VIRAL ATTACK IS BREATHING ON HER OWN, IN STABLE CONDITION: REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the Carter County Grand Jury returned indictments charging the following five individuals in connection with the case:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deputies arrested all five suspects over the weekend and stated that all were released from custody after posting a $25,000 bond each, except Shearl, who remains at the Carter County Detention Center. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Security officials have announced that Barzan Majeed, one of the most notorious human smugglers in Europe, was arrested in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of Europe&apos;s most notorious human smugglers was arrested Monday in the semi-autonomous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/turkish-warplanes-strike-kurdish-militant-positions-iraq-attack-kills-soldier-wounds-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kurdish region of northern Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, security officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regional government&apos;s security agency said it had arrested Barzan Majeed, known as &quot;the Scorpion,&quot; in the area of Sulaymaniyah, upon a request from Interpol and &quot;after the exchange of intelligence information.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/turkey-carries-new-airstrikes-northern-iraq-killing-16-militants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TURKEY CARRIES OUT NEW AIRSTRIKES IN NORTHERN IRAQ, KILLING 16 KURDISH MILITANTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was handed over to the regional justice department, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-officers-arrest-man-involvement-least-27-deaths-channel-crossing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.K.&apos;s National Crime Agency&lt;/a&gt; announced Majeed&apos;s arrest on the X social media platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crime agency had issued an appeal for assistance in tracking Majeed down in 2022, after he was convicted in absentia in Belgium of people smuggling crimes, following a joint U.K.-Belgian investigation. The agency said he had attempted to smuggle 100 migrants to the U.K. in small boats and trucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats has soared in recent years as individuals fleeing war, the effects of climate change, and economic uncertainty have sought a better life in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They pay smugglers thousands of dollars for the crossing, hoping to reunite with family members or find work in a country where immigration enforcement is seen as weak and where migrant groups from all over the world can easily blend into society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the U.K. Parliament approved controversial legislation allowing the government to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/belfast-judge-says-parts-uks-migrant-deportation-law-shouldnt-apply-northern-ireland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;deport to Rwanda&lt;/a&gt; those who enter the country illegally. Hours later, five people, including a 7-year-old girl, died while crossing the English Channel in an overloaded inflatable boat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the would-be migrants hail from Iraqi&apos;s northern Kurdish region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the region is relatively more prosperous and stable than other parts of the country, increasing unemployment and corruption issues are driving many young Kurds to undertake the dangerous journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 2021, 16 Iraqi Kurds were among a group of 27 people who died while attempting to cross the channel.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Nevada Supreme Court rejects teachers union-backed appeal to put A&apos;s public funding on &apos;24 ballot</title>
                    
                    <description>A proposed ballot initiative, which would let voters choose whether to repeal public funding approved last year for a new MLB stadium, has been struck down by the Nevada Supreme Court.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nevada-supreme-court-rules-favor-countys-plan-hand-ballots-some-restrictions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Nevada Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; on Monday struck down a proposed ballot initiative that would allow voters to decide whether to repeal the public funding that lawmakers approved last year for a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mlb-stadiums-united-states&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MLB stadium&lt;/a&gt; in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Monday ruling dealt a blow for detractors of the funding who saw a ballot question this year as the most effective route to repeal key parts of the sweeping bill that paved the way for the Oakland Athletics to move to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/las-vegas-alien-videos-previously-missed-detail-proves-authenticity-expert-says-you-cant-deny-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/nevada-supreme-court-another-look-chasing-horses-request-dismiss-sex-abuse-charges&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEVADA SUPREME COURT WILL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT CHASING HORSE&apos;S REQUEST TO DISMISS SEX ABUSE CHARGES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five judges voted to uphold a lower court ruling that struck down the referendum. One judge dissented, while another concurred in-part and dissented in-part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement following the ruling, Schools over Stadiums political action committee spokesperson Alexander Marks said their focus is now to get the question on the 2026 ballot. The PAC is backed by the Nevada State Education Association, a statewide teachers union who has long opposed public funding for the stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stadium financing debate in Nevada mirrors those happening nationwide over whether public funds should be used to help finance sports stadiums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A&apos;s representatives and some Nevada tourism officials have said the public funding could add to Las Vegas’ growing sports scene and act as an economic engine. But a growing chorus of stadium economists, educators and some lawmakers had warned that it would bring minimal benefits, especially when compared to the hefty public price tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nevada Supreme Court ruled that the entirety of the 66-page bill must be included in the ballot question to provide its full context. But ballot referendums can be no more than 200 words — which lawyers for Schools over Stadiums admitted made it difficult to explain the complex bill during oral arguments last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court ruled that the 200-word description submitted by Schools over Stadiums was &quot;misleading&quot; and &quot;explains the general effect of a referendum, but it does not describe the practical effects of this specific referendum.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney Bradley Schrager, who represents the two plaintiffs who are labor union lobbyists in favor of the public funding, said on Monday that &quot;all Nevadans have a right to participate in direct democracy, but they need to observe the laws that require properly informing the voters of a proposal. This measure obviously fails to do that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLB owners have unanimously approved the A’s move to Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>North Macedonia’s new president seeks to sidestep disputes with EU neighbors</title>
                    
                    <description>North Macedonia, a European Union candidate, is seeking to calm disputes with Greece and Bulgaria after the election victory of a conservative-backed president and coalition.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;European Union candidate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-macedonia-elects-first-woman-president-center-left-incumbents-suffer-historic-losses&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;North Macedonia&lt;/a&gt; sought Monday to calm disputes with EU neighbors Greece and Bulgaria that flared up following the landslide election victory of a conservative-backed coalition and president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Macedonia changed its name from Macedonia after a 2018 landmark agreement with Greece that ended a years-long quarrel over the name, which had been claimed by Greece for one of its regions. At a swearing in ceremony Sunday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/center-right-coalition-wins-north-macedonia-parliamentary-election-seek-governing-coalition-partner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova&lt;/a&gt; referred to her country as &quot;Macedonia,&quot; prompting a heated response from Athens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-macedonia-votes-presidential-runoff-parliamentary-elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NORTH MACEDONIA VOTES IN PRESIDENTIAL RUNOFF, PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/turkey-greece-leaders-meet-friendship-initiative-test-gaza-ukraine-wars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis&lt;/a&gt; called the remarks &quot;illegal and unacceptable,&quot; in an online post Monday, adding: &quot;We declare categorically that we will not accept any further missteps of this nature.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siljanovska-Davkova’s comments also drew criticism from the European Commission and a warning from Bulgaria that North Macedonia would be held to the terms of international agreements it had signed up to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president’s office said Monday that Siljanovska-Davkova would respect the country’s international obligations but added that she retains &quot;the right to use the name Macedonia as a personal right of self-identification.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The geographical region of Macedonia is divided by the national borders of Greece, Bulgaria and North Macedonia. The name dispute delayed the former Yugoslav republic’s long-standing efforts to join the European Union and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country joined the military alliance in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Macedonia’s conservative VMRO-DPMNE won a landslide twin presidential and parliamentary election last week and is set to lead the next government after emerging from years in opposition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Avalanche star Valeri Nichushkin suspended for 6 months hours before playoff game</title>
                    
                    <description>Colorado Avalanche star Valeri Nichushkin was suspended for six months and will enter Stage 3 of the NHL/NHLPA Assistance Program, the league and union announced.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Colorado Avalanche will be without winger Valeri Nichushkin for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/stanley-cup-playoffs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Stanley Cup Playoffs&lt;/a&gt; and for several months as he was placed in Stage 3 of the NHL/NHLPA Assistance Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement came hours before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nhl/colorado-avalanche&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Avalanche&lt;/a&gt; took on the Dallas Stars in Game 4 of their Western Conference semifinals matchup. It’s the second time this season he’s been in the program, and Stage 3 means he violated the terms of the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Under the terms of the joint program, Nichushkin will be suspended without pay for a minimum of six months and then will be eligible to apply for reinstatement,&quot; a joint statement read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was leading the team with nine playoff goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nichushkin was out for nearly two months earlier in the season to receive care from the program for issues that were not disclosed. It came on the heels of missing the final five games of a playoff exit last season for what the team called personal reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Avalanche’s playoff series against the Seattle Kraken last season, he left the team for personal reasons. His absence started after officers were called to a crisis at a hotel before Game 3. A 28-year-old woman was reportedly in an ambulance when police arrived, and medics were told to speak with an Avalanche team physician to gather more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/top-5-best-nicknames-nhl-new-utah-team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP 5 BEST NICKNAMES FOR NHL&apos;S NEW UTAH TEAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Seattle police report said the Avalanche &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/intoxicated-woman-found-avalanches-valeri-nichushkin-hotel-room-hospitalized-reports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;physician told officers&lt;/a&gt; that team employees found the woman when they checked on Nichushkin, The Associated Press reported. The physician told officers the woman appeared to be heavily intoxicated, too intoxicated to have left the hotel in a cab or otherwise and requested EMS assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know you guys want to find something there, but it’s nothing really interesting. I think we should close it,&quot; he said before the season when asked about the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 54 games he did play during the 2023-24 season, he scored 28 goals and racked up 53 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Fox News host Sean Hannity shreds &amp;quot;Trump hater&amp;quot; Michael Cohen&amp;apos;s testimony in the New York v. Trump case on Monday&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Hannity.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News host Sean Hannity shreds Michael Cohen’s testimony in NY v. Trump on &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hannity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEAN HANNITY:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt; This is beyond a judicial circus featuring plenty of clowns. We&apos;ve already heard testimony from the porn star that admits she hates &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/whoopi-goldberg-says-not-going-anywhere-trump-suggests-leave-country-wins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, wants him in jail, owes him what, $500,000 plus dollars? Last week, she testified that she sees dead people and told jurors many graphic stories and jokes, completely irrelevant, all of it immaterial to the case. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/jen-psaki-forced-edit-book-after-making-misleading-claim-about-biden-not-checking-watch-ceremony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;JEN PSAKI FORCED TO EDIT BOOK AFTER MAKING MISLEADING CLAIM ABOUT BIDEN NOT CHECKING WATCH AT CEREMONY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Today was the day for their star witness, Michael Cohen, the fixer in court. He&apos;s a disbarred lawyer, Trump hater, released from prison in 2020 after a multi-year sentence for tax evasion, bank fraud, a variety of other crimes. He was also convicted of lying to Congress after lying under oath.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By the way, right now he is facing even more allegations of lying to Congress. Those allegations were recently referred to Joe Biden&apos;s weaponized DOJ. For months, Cohen has been out there appearing to solicit donations or what they call gifts on TikTok, often while wearing a shirt depicting &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/cheers-star-declares-why-he-thinks-working-class-americans-support-trump-knows-how-build-things&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; behind bars. Even fake news, their CNN experts, they&apos;re perplexed that the prosecution would ask a jury to believe anything this guy has to say.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News Jesse Watters discusses Michael Cohen&apos;s history of lies and his testimony during former Presidnet Trump&apos;s New York trial Monday on &quot;Jesse Watters Primetime.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ny-v-trump-cohen-testifies-paying-stormy-daniels-his-own-pocket&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NY V. TRUMP: COHEN TESTIFIES TO PAYING STORMY DANIELS FROM HIS OWN POCKET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JESSE WATTERS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Day 16 of the Trump trial or no one will tell us the crime. Alvin Bragg star witness Michael Cohen finally took the stand today. The prosecution tried to paint Cohen as a respectable family man who became a lawyer to please his granny. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But the packed courtroom rolled its eyes because everybody knows the real Cohen -  man who lied to that same granny to get ahead. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michael-cohen-testifies-he-secretly-recorded-trump-lead-up-2016-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cohen has been&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; disbarred from practicing law. He went to jail for perjury and tax evasion, lied to banks. He lied to Congress, lied to his wife. Cohen even secretly recorded conversations with Trump. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When you talk to your lawyer, and he secretly tapes your conversations and violates your attorney-client privilege, he&apos;s not your lawyer. He&apos;s a rat. Alvin Bragg&apos;s whole case rests on a lying rat. Cohen wants his client sent to jail for following his advice. The man will say anything to convict Trump and rehab his disgraced career.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tomorrow, the defense will &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/may-13-trump-trial-michael-cohen-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;cross-examine Cohen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and they&apos;ll have plenty of fodder. Today, Cohen told the court he paid Stormy Daniels by taking a loan out on his own home. Why didn&apos;t he just cut Stormy a check? He says he didn&apos;t want his wife to find out. Why would Cohen&apos;s wife care if Trump was paying to keep a porn star quiet? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Was Cohen protecting Trump or himself? Then Cohen punched a hole through the prosecution&apos;s case so big Bragg could fit through it. He testified he killed the same Stormy Daniels story when it was posted on a gossip website in 2011. Was Trump running for president in 2011? No, that would be Mitt Romney, which proves famous tycoons catch and kill bad press because bad press is bad for business, and happy wife [equals] happy life. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Iowa women&apos;s basketball coach Lisa Bluder announces her retirement</title>
                    
                    <description>Iowa women&amp;apos;s basketball head coach Lisa Bluder announced her retirement from the sport on Monday — about a month after the Hawkeyes lost the national title game to South Carolina.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/iowa-hawkeyes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Iowa women’s basketball&lt;/a&gt; head coach Lisa Bluder announced her retirement on Monday as former Hawkeyes star Caitlin Clark nears her pro debut with the WNBA’s Indiana Fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bluder’s longtime assistant Jan Jensen was named her successor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is no denying that this past season was incredible for so many reasons, and we could not have accomplished our achievements without all of you,&quot; Bluder said in an open letter to fans. &quot;After the season ended, I spent time with our student-athletes and coaches reviewing the season and preparing those moving on for what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;With that also came personal contemplation about what this journey has meant to me, how to best champion this program, and what the future looks like for my family and me. After then taking some time away with my husband, David, it became clear to me that I am ready to step aside.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bluder’s retirement came more than a month after Iowa dropped its second consecutive national championship — this time it was to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/south-carolina-gamecocks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She spent 24 years leading the Hawkeyes after spending 10 years &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/drake-bulldogs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;at Drake&lt;/a&gt;. Bluder was 716-359 in her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark, arguably the best player in Bluder’s tenure, congratulated her former coach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/caitlin-clark-recalls-frustrating-media-storm-2023-national-championship-loss&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAITLIN CLARK RECALLS &apos;FRUSTRATING&apos; MEDIA STORM OVER 2023 NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP LOSS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Simply no one better at building a team,&quot; Clark wrote on X. &quot;Thank you for believing in me more than anyone. Enjoy retirement, coach. Very much deserved.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jensen will take the reins starting in the 2024-25 season. She was an associate head coach under Bluder for 20 years. She was also with Bluder when they were at Drake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was an All-American at Drake and the highest-scoring player ever in six-on-six basketball at El Horn-Kimballton High School in Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is no better person to lead this program than Jan Jensen and I am thrilled she will have the opportunity to build on the foundation established,&quot; Bluder said. &quot;I’m committed to help her, and her staff, in whatever capacity they need moving forward.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bluder helped Iowa to five Big Ten Tournament championships. She was the Big Ten Coach of the Year three times and the 2019 Naismith College Coach of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

She was seriously injured and airlifted to a burn center, where she remains in critical condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/georgia-man-charged-murdering-law-student-setting-fire-apartment-23-year-old-cold-case-denied-bond&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GEORGIA MAN CHARGED WITH MURDERING LAW STUDENT, SETTING FIRE TO APARTMENT IN 23-YEAR-OLD COLD CASE DENIED BOND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fire crews stated that they found Gunnerson hiding in the backyard, armed with a knife. Deputies allegedly had to Taze him &quot;numerous&quot; times to take him into custody, WBTV reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gunnerson was also burned and required treatment. He was arrested after he was released from the hospital and charged with first-degree arson and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;attempted first-degree murder,&lt;/a&gt; according to Forsyth County jail records. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is being held without bond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the Rowan County Sheriff’s Office for comment. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Disgraced former NBA ref Tim Donaghy: Shohei Ohtani &apos;absolutely&apos; knew about interpreter&apos;s gambling addiction</title>
                    
                    <description>Ex-NBA referee Tim Donaghy, who infamously resigned over allegations of bets on games he officiated, says Shohei Ohtani had to know Ippei Mizuhara had a gambling problem.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As Ippei Mizuhara, the former interpreter of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/los-angeles-dodgers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Dodgers&lt;/a&gt; superstar Shohei Ohtani, is dealing with the legal matters of his gambling scandal, many still question how much the two-way baseball player knew about it before everything blew up in the public eye. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the 2024 regular season began, Ohtani held a press conference, during which no media was allowed to ask questions and he said he has &quot;never&quot; bet on sports and Mizuhara’s claim that Ohtani was voluntarily paying off his massive gambling debt was a &quot;complete lie.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, disgraced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;former NBA referee&lt;/a&gt; Tim Donaghy, who went to prison after admitting he bet on games he officiated in many seasons in the early 2000s, isn’t buying that Ohtani had no clue about Mizuhara’s gambling addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donaghy made an appearance on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outkick.com/shows/hot-mic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;OutKick’s &quot;Hot Mic,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; when he was asked if there’s any way Ohtani didn’t know. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Heck no,&quot; he responded. &quot;I think Major League Baseball was smart to sweep this under the rug as quickly as possible. You look at that guy and what he’s done for baseball globally and the fans he’s attracted around the world, the last thing they want is for him to be somebody who’s involved in betting on his own games and maybe doing things that he wasn’t supposed to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think they were very smart to get that under the rug as quickly as possible and say that he had nothing to do with it, and basically have this other guy take the fall for everything.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/shohei-ohtani-says-he-has-never-bet-sports-calls-ex-interpreters-story-complete-lie&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHOHEI OHTANI SAYS HE HAS ‘NEVER’ BET ON SPORTS, CALLS EX-INTERPRETER&apos;S STORY ‘COMPLETE LIE’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donaghy also doesn’t believe Mizuhara never bet on baseball, considering investigators found he placed about 19,000 bets between December 2021 and January 2024, which comes out to about 25 per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mizuhara bet an average $12,800 per bet, with ranges between $10 and $160,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think absolutely,&quot; Donaghy said when asked if he believed Mizuhara bet on baseball. &quot;When you look at the amount of bets he was placing, obviously he had some type of addiction. It’s not like he could just turn it off when he had baseball seasons. There’s no doubt in my mind that he not only bet on baseball, he bet on Ohtani’s game, and I think Ohtani was right there with him knowing what he was doing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLB and Ohtani&apos;s agent, Nez Balelo, did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Donaghy&apos;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donaghy isn’t the only one who believes Ohtani played a part in this. Pete Rose, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MLB’s all-time hits leader&lt;/a&gt; who also has an infamous gambling past, made an eye-popping comment when the scandal first came to light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, back in the ‘70s and ‘80s, I wish I’d have had an interpreter. I’d be scot-free,&quot; Rose said in a video posted to social media just days after things broke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mizuhara is expected to plead guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return per the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California. He’s likely to enter the plea at some point in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The extent of this defendant&apos;s deception and theft is massive,&quot; U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement. &quot;He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit. My office is committed to vindicating victims throughout our community and ensuring that wrongdoers face justice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estrada added that Mizuhara became Ohtani’s &quot;de facto manager&quot; because of how prevalent he was in his life. His role in Ohtani’s life led him to have access to his bank accounts, having the ability to withdraw money to finance his gambling habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an investigation, federal authorities found Mizuhara stole an estimated $17 million, which he will be required to pay Ohtani back as a condition of the plea agreement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I never bet on baseball or any other sports or never have asked somebody to do that on my behalf,&quot; Ohtani said through a new interpreter prior to the Dodgers&apos; final spring training game. &quot;And never went through a bookmaker to bet on sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m very saddened and shocked that someone who I trusted has done this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohtani is the highest-paid player in MLB after agreeing to a historic 10-year, $700 million contract in free agency to join the Dodgers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Florida man, who aspired to become a police officer, admitted to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sexually abusing&lt;/a&gt; his cousin during a police department job interview and now faces life in prison. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Bodley, 26, was convicted by an Orange County jury last week of sexual battery on a child, the office of State Attorney Andrew Bain said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodley first mentioned &quot;playing sexual games&quot; in a sworn officer application with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Apopka Police Department.&lt;/a&gt; He again mentioned the crime during an interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The certified voice stress analysis examiner performed a voice stress examination on Bodley,&quot; Bain said. &quot;During the examination, the examiner asked Bodley to expand on concerning answers he provided in a pre-test questionnaire.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/maine-gov-mills-declines-remove-embattled-sheriff-office&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MAINE GOV. MILLS DECLINES TO REMOVE EMBATTLED SHERIFF FROM OFFICE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodley described &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/sex-crimes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sexually abusing&lt;/a&gt; a child years ago and admitted to it when he was asked to expand further. Detectives tracked down the victim&apos;s mother, who said Bodley and the victim had a close relationship, The Tampa Bay Times reported, citing an affidavit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital has reached out to prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-man-bit-chunk-deputys-head-assault-music-festival-sheriffs-office&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLORIDA MAN BIT CHUNK OUT OF DEPUTY&apos;S HEAD AT MUSIC FESTIVAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victim, a female, told the Florida Department of Children and Families about the abuse, saying it took place over several years, from when Bodley was around 14 to when he was about 19, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodley&apos;s lawyer asked that his confession not be presented during trial, but a judge denied the request. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 24. The conviction carries a sentence of up to life in prison. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>New Jersey quintuplets graduate from same university together: &apos;Gigantic moment&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Quintuplets Victoria, Ludovico, Ashley, Michael and Marcus Povolo made history by graduating from Montclair State University at the same time on Monday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New Jersey quintuplets&lt;/a&gt; achieved the impossible by graduating from the same university this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victoria, Ludovico, Ashley, Michael and Marcus Povolo earned their diplomas from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Montclair State University&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. In a press release, the school said that the siblings are likely the only quintuplets in the Garden State to have ever accomplished the feat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The milestone at Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, is believed to be the first time quints have simultaneously graduated from a New Jersey higher ed institution, with the Povolos joining just a handful of other multiple siblings in the nation who celebrated their &apos;quintessential&apos; college experience by graduating from the same college in the same academic year,&quot; Montclair State said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The siblings were born on July 4, 2002.  All of the quintuplets had different callings and graduated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;different majors.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/mississippi-mother-rare-quintuplets-reveals-first-photos-babies-reach-new-milestones&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISSISSIPPI MOTHER OF RARE QUINTUPLETS REVEALS FIRST PHOTOS OF HER BABIES AS THEY &apos;REACH NEW MILESTONES&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victoria and Ashley majored in biochemistry and English, respectively. Ludovico studied political science, while Michael studied food science and Marcus graduated with a degree in business administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chance of having quintuplets is roughly one in 55 million – and all five graduating from the same university is even rarer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Montclair State sweetened the deal when, in 2020, they offered all five siblings Presidential Scholarships – saved only for the most high-achieving students. The Povolo family also qualified for need-based grants and additional scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s so big we can’t even put words to it,&quot; mother Silvia Povolo told Montclair State. &quot;I always sit down with them and say, ‘You had four years of college that came to your table and you had the chance to take it with no cost. Whatever you learned in these four years, it’s a blessing… it’s a key to open a golden door.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/texas-couple-donated-frozen-embryos-20-years-ago-meets-biological-teen-triplets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TEXAS COUPLE WHO DONATED FROZEN EMBRYOS 20 YEARS AGO MEETS BIOLOGICAL TEEN TRIPLETS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The siblings all expressed gratitude for their time at Montclair State, which allowed them to meet up regularly for coffee and meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Montclair helped us be together, but also helped us to become our own people, with our own majors, our own interests, our own friend groups,&quot; Victoria explained in the press release. &quot;We customized our own paths, but we got to the finish line together.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The support that they have for us, obviously, there’s a reason why we made it this far,&quot; she added. &quot;Our parents &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/parenting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;always encourage us&lt;/a&gt; to do our best, and the best doesn’t look the same for everyone, which I think is also something we learned growing up and explains why we’re all doing different things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before they graduated, Michael remarked that his mother was going to become emotional when watching them walk across the stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’ll need a tissue box for my mom,&quot; he said. &quot;She’s definitely going to cry.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The father of the quintuplets called Monday&apos;s graduation ceremony &quot;a gigantic moment for them and for us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So basically, we’ve been saying, ‘when one door closes another one opens.’ In the sense that college is coming to an end, we have to think of the future, we have to think of what’s next … and that is in the making,&quot; Paolo Povolo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>LAURA INGRAHAM: NY vs. Trump was &apos;a bomb from day one&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Fox News host Laura Ingraham says Alvin Bragg hopes that Michael Cohen can help deliver a guilty verdict in the NY v. Trump case on &amp;quot;The Ingraham Angle.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News host Laura Ingraham says Michael Cohen’s recording of former President Trump did not prove anything in court Monday on &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Ingraham Angle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LAURA INGRAHAM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Jughead&apos;s in a jam&quot; -- that&apos;s the focus of tonight&apos;s &quot;Angle.&quot; ... The big moment in court today was supposed to be the playing of a taped conversation that Michael Cohen recorded between Trump and himself back in 2016 (yeah, eight years ago), where they can be heard talking about how they would buy the rights to Karen McDougal&apos;s story. On the tape, Cohen can be heard explaining to the then presidential candidate his plans to form an LLC through which he would finance the purchase of the rights to that woman&apos;s story. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-cohens-credibility-issues-brazen-tiktok-usage-raise-media-eyebrows-ahead-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL COHEN&apos;S CREDIBILITY ISSUES, BRAZEN TIKTOK USAGE RAISE MEDIA EYEBROWS AHEAD OF TESTIMONY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;None of the hype amounted to anything. None of it proved anything. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ironically, Alvin Bragg hopes that Jughead is his fixer, that Michael Cohen can help deliver a guilty verdict in a case that was a bomb from day one. Now, only the radical, far-left legal mind would think that a convicted perjurer and a nutty porn star should be considered serious people, let alone help decide the next presidential election. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club Inner Circle announced the names of Punxsutawney Phil&amp;apos;s two new baby groundhogs on Mother&amp;apos;s Day.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Punxsutawney Phil’s two new groundhog babies have been given names that are right on brand with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/occasions/holiday&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Groundhog Day.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club Inner Circle announced on Mother&apos;s Day that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;baby girl and boy groundhogs&lt;/a&gt; will be called Sunny and Shadow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the pups were born in March, members of the public submitted hundreds of name suggestions, according to TMX, which were reviewed by the club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/groundhog-day-history-superstitious-tradition-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GROUNDHOG DAY&apos;S HISTORY, MEANING AND HOW THE SUPERSTITIOUS TRADITION MADE ITS WAY TO THE US&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a video announcement on Facebook, club vice president Dan McGinley shared the chosen names in true Groundhog Day fashion: by reading them off a scroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Born to royalty, a boy and a girl, names have been chosen to share with the world,&quot; he rhymed. &quot;Welcome with us as we say hello to little girl, Sunny and a boy, Shadow.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/groundhog-day-quiz-how-well-know-facts-day&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;GROUNDHOG DAY QUIZ! HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW THE FACTS ABOUT THIS UNIQUE DAY?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGinley continued, &quot;With pride and joy as the kids play, from Punxsutawney, Happy Mother&apos;s Day!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the current Phil&apos;s first time being a father, even though there has been a long line of Punxsutawney Phils who’ve emerged to see their shadows since 1886.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means these babies are not Phil’s replacement, McGinley told the Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They’re not the heir apparent,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sunny and Shadow will not be part of the ceremony — it’s still Phil’s job. There’s still only one Punxsutawney Phil.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 2, 2024, Phil made the rare prediction of an early spring after not seeing his shadow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public can visit Punxsutawney Phil and his new family in their climate-controlled burrow at the Punxsutawney Memorial Library in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;TMX and the Associated Press contributed reporting. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Mike Tyson says his body feels like &apos;s--- right now,&apos; while Jake Paul oozes confidence ahead of fight</title>
                    
                    <description>Mike Tyson is 30 years Jake Paul&amp;apos;s senior, and it&amp;apos;s been nearly two decades since his last professional fight — it&amp;apos;s no wonder why his body is &amp;apos;s---.&amp;apos;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two generations of boxing are coming face-to-face in Arlington, Texas, in just about two months, and neither Mike Tyson nor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jake-paul&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jake Paul&lt;/a&gt; Is hiding their age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyson, 57, and Paul, 27, began their press tour for their much-anticipated fight on Monday at the legendary Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York. And, despite just being miles from where Tyson grew up, the crowd seemed pretty split between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The July 20 bout will mark &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/boxing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Tyson’s first fight&lt;/a&gt; in over four years, when he fought Roy Jones Jr. in an exhibition (Paul was on that undercard against Nate Robinson). It will be a sanctioned, professional fight, which Tyson hasn’t participated in since June 11, 2005, against Kevin McBride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formerly known as the &quot;Baddest Man on the Planet,&quot; Tyson has been posting clips of his training, and make no mistake, his power is still there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he’s no spring chicken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are doubts whether, at his age, he can last the eight rounds, each of which will be two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/deontay-wilder-scared-mike-tyson-well-being-jake-paul-fight&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEONTAY WILDER SCARED FOR MIKE TYSON&apos;S WELL-BEING IN JAKE PAUL FIGHT: HE&apos;S TOO OLD FOR THIS&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a man who exuded more confidence than anyone, Tyson obviously knows that Father Time is undefeated, and he was brutally honest about how he feels physically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My body is s--- right now,&quot; he admitted on Monday. &quot;I’m really sore.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That confidence Tyson once had, Paul has it all, if not more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The YouTuber-turned-boxer has made the sport the most popular it has been since Tyson’s heyday. He’s done it in a much different way, but it’s not hyperbole when one says this may be the biggest fight in modern history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s almost ironic that Paul is going from boxers hardly anyone ever heard of in his last two fights (Andre August and Ryan Bourland, each of whom were first-round knockouts) to arguably the best ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when a fan asked Paul if he could &quot;take a hit&quot; from Tyson, that confidence was on full display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They call him Iron Mike Tyson, but I’m Titanium Jake Paul.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior, he said, &quot;I&apos;m going to show the world that I can outbox Mike Tyson, prove everyone wrong, and show that I will be the one doing the killing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite how his body feels, though, Tyson gave Paul a fair warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Once he’s in that ring,&quot; Tyson said, &quot;he has to fight like his life depends on it, because it will be.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul is 9-1 in his career, with his lone loss being via decision to Tommy Fury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyson and Paul will now head to Dallas for one more press conference on Thursday, the same day tickets go on sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fight will be broadcast on Netflix, a first-of-its-kind event, as it will be free for subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

At the time of his death, he had an estimated net worth of US$6.4 billion, which includes a refinery in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/mysterious-brain-disease-cluster-under-investigation-in-canada&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt; that is Canada’s largest, along with the Whitegate refinery in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in 1930, Irving attended &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/nova-scotia-wildfire-sends-east-coast-air-quality-plummeting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Nova Scotia’s&lt;/a&gt; Acadia University before leaving to join Irving Oil in 1951, where he worked with his father and his two brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I had the choice to go on at Acadia or learn about business from the best teacher available anywhere — my father,&quot; he told author Donald Savoie in his 2020 book about Irving Oil. &quot;I went with the best teacher.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He became president of the company in 1972 and was chairman emeritus when he died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His death comes as the company’s Saint John refinery is undergoing a &quot;strategic review&quot; to determine its future, as climate change is prompting a shift away from fossil fuels in some nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While his biographers have credited Irving with success in expanding the company, he also had a life marked by family difficulties, including a contentious 1980 divorce with his first wife and — more recently — his estrangement from his eldest son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his book, &quot;Irving vs. Irving,&quot; published in 2014, journalist Jacques Poitras described a poignant scene from August 2013, when Irving stood at a Saint John news conference announcing that his company was officially launching a bid — which ultimately didn’t succeed — to build a pipeline to carry crude oil from Alberta to the family’s refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poitras noted that Kenneth, &quot;his son and heir,&quot; was notably absent after a falling out led to his departure from the company in 2010. &quot;Arthur, in his eighties, was surrounded by admirers, yet alone. His refinery loomed in the background ... but his family was torn asunder,&quot; Poitras wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s and ’90s, Arthur Irving’s business life and interests were tightly tied to his two brothers, J.K. and Jack, as they took primary responsibility for different segments of the business empire their father had created. The trucking firms ran on the companies’ refined gasoline, the forestry and shipping interests used the Irvings’ construction subsidiaries, and a chain of newspapers purchased the newsprint from a nearby factory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 2009, the three Irving brothers separated their business interests, with Arthur assuming control of the energy business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its statement, the company described Irving as &quot;a steadfast champion of Atlantic Canada and its people&quot; and one of a kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In this immense loss, we know there will never be another like him,&quot; it said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nearly 50 homes were destroyed and dozens more were seriously damaged during severe weather last week in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/michigan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;southwestern Michigan&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; Kalamazoo County, authorities said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lost homes included 24 mobile homes near Portage, the county&apos;s emergency management office said in an update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Weather Service confirmed four tornadoes in the region on May 7, including one in the Kalamazoo area, 140 miles &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/detroit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;west of Detroit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6352495776112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEDEX BUILDING IN MICHIGAN DESTROYED BY TORNADO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency crews were arriving Tuesday to assess damage in southwestern Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a traumatic event and a stressful time for many, and allowing us to interrupt their personal recovery efforts to begin our collective recovery as a community is greatly appreciated,&quot; said Mike Corfman, Kalamazoo County&apos;s emergency director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weather service said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/tornado&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the tornado&lt;/a&gt; was an EF-2, which means a wind gust of 111 mph to 135 mph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was one mile an hour short of being&quot; an EF-3, Corfman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said 28 people were still staying at an area shelter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’re trying to work out some longer-term sheltering for those people,&quot; Corfman said. &quot;Generally, the people that are there, their homes are gone. They just cannot go back, period.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bodycam video from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/maryland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Maryland Department&lt;/a&gt; of Natural Resources (DNR) officers captured the confusion and shock of the situation when they first witnessed the aftermath and rubble of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That morning, the 984-foot Sri Lanka-bound Dali container ship struck the Key Bridge, causing it to collapse into the Patapsco River beneath, leaving six construction workers dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when DNR officers responded to the scene, they were unaware of what they were about to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital acquired 18 videos from DNR, giving a first-hand look at what the officers saw when they arrived at the scene of the collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/body-sixth-victim-baltimore-key-bridge-collapse-pulled-from-water&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BODY OF SIXTH VICTIM IN BALTIMORE KEY BRIDGE COLLAPSE PULLED FROM WATER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Key Bridge fell at about 1:30 a.m. on March 26 and DNR officers started to arrive at the disaster nearly an hour later, though other first responders were already at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One video shows a DNR officer arriving on the scene and speaking with another law enforcement official and getting an update of what he was about to experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How long have you guys been on the scene?,&quot; the DNR officer asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-fifth-body-recovered-francis-scott-key-bridge-wreckage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BALTIMORE BRIDGE COLLAPSE: FIFTH BODY RECOVERED FROM FRANCIS SCOTT KEY BRIDGE WRECKAGE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well over an hour. We got one out of the water. There’s supposed to be another four, somewhere, but they were all in a vehicle that went down, so we can’t get them,&quot; the other law enforcement official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By about 3:15 a.m., the DNR officer had pulled up next to the Dali, where he saw one of the crew mates and asked if anyone was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;hurt during the crash.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person on board could not be heard on video, though the DNR officer confirmed with the individual that one person had sustained an injury to their hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-second-temporary-channel-reopened-rough-weather-slows-debris-removal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BALTIMORE BRIDGE COLLAPSE: SECOND TEMPORARY CHANNEL OPENED, ROUGH WEATHER SLOWS DEBRIS REMOVAL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officer asked if the individual needed medical attention and was told the pilot onboard had already called for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to that point, nobody had boarded the ship to tend to the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than three hours had passed, and it was still unknown how many people had fallen into the water as a result of the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-us-army-corps-engineers-too-early-know-cleanup-timeline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS SAYS IT&apos;S ‘TOO EARLY’ TO KNOW BRIDGE DEBRIS CLEANUP TIMELINE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The camera footage &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/disaster-response&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;captured first responders&lt;/a&gt; working to find out how many victims were in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One responder was heard saying nobody was doing anything, while another asked how many people were in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’ve heard various numbers. We’re not sure,&quot; a person responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/baltimore-key-bridge-house-republicans-divided-biden-vows-feds-foot-bill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HOUSE REPUBLICANS DIVIDED AFTER BIDEN VOWS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL FOOT THE BILL FOR KEY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;10-4, we’ll proceed with caution,&quot; the first responder said before being warned there was a lot of debris in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sun had yet to rise by 5 a.m., when one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;DNR officers&lt;/a&gt; was heard speaking to another person about what he was witnessing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dude, this is f-----g bad,&quot; he said. &quot;Like, there is no bridge. Like, there is no bridge.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He described what he saw when he was arriving on the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/baltimore-bridge-collapse-maryland-governor-conditions-currently-unsafe-rescue-divers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MARYLAND GOVERNOR SAYS CONDITIONS ARE ‘UNSAFE’ FOR RESCUE DIVERS AFTER BRIDGE COLLAPSE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s like, are you kidding me? It’s like, something’s missing here on the skyline… the whole center span is gone completely. It’s in the water,&quot; the officer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another conversation captured between two officers questioning not just the message from the boat five minutes before crashing into the bridge, but also what the disaster could mean for Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why the… five minutes out and you said you’re going to hit,&quot; the first officer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second officer suggested the captain could have dropped an anchor or something to prevent the massive vessel from striking the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is catastrophic,&quot; one of the men said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The infrastructure of Baltimore is going to take a hit,&quot; the other said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the bridge collapsed, six bodies have been pulled from the submerged rubble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maryland Gov. Wes Moore announced last month that the state will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;establish a scholarship&lt;/a&gt; for the families of transportation workers who die on the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital’s Stepheny Price contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
