                    <description>A 36-year-old mother of five was stabbed in an unprovoked attack near Times Square, New York, and now the woman&amp;apos;s husband is speaking out and demanding justice.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The family of a 36-year-old mother who was stabbed near Times Square in broad daylight is speaking out about the unprovoked attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Lohr, whose wife Amber was assaulted by a man with a knife while chaperoning a group of schoolgirls on a class trip, says the family has no plans to return to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We don&apos;t feel safe there,&quot; Lohr told the New York Post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident took place near Port Gourmet Deli on West 43rd and Eighth Avenue on Saturday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/video-shows-nyc-man-stab-random-woman-near-times-square&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIDEO SHOWS NYC MAN STAB RANDOM WOMAN NEAR TIMES SQUARE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amber Lohr was escorting the students by the Port Gourmet Deli near Time Square when the man, identified as 61-year-old Cyril Destin, allegedly lunged at her with a kitchen knife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack was caught on video obtained by the New York Post. Surveillance footage shows a man walking out of the deli before placing his walker against the building and sitting on the walker’s seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man, wearing gray pants, a bright fluorescent green shirt, black jacket and orange hat then lights up a cigarette, crosses his arms and reaches inside the jacket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then appeared to pull a large kitchen knife out of his jacket, lunged toward two women and slashed one of them, Lohr, before returning to his walker seat and smoking his cigarette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-stabbed-outside-nyc-migrant-shelter-2-suspects-believed-involved-nypd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MAN STABBED OUTSIDE NYC MIGRANT SHELTER, 2 SUSPECTS BELIEVED TO BE INVOLVED: NYPD&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspected attacker, Destin, has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;arrested 24 times&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over the past 20 years for things like criminal mischief and trespassing, the Post&apos;s NYPD sources said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A guy with a very lengthy record went out of nowhere and attacked my wife by stabbing her into the chest and within inches of her life being lost,&quot; Lohr&apos;s husband said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Lohr described his wife as a &quot;hero&quot; for protecting the children even as blood from the stab wound soaked through her clothes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My wife not only had taken the stabbing but should also be considered a hero by remaining in front of the children, coaching them to go backwards without turning around,&quot; John told the Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/multiple-injured-party-boat-stabbing-near-new-york-city-pier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;AT LEAST 2 INJURED IN PARTY BOAT STABBING NEAR NEW YORK CITY PIER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the students were safe, Amber told a bystander she had been stabbed and the bystander ran for help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whomever she was, ‘Thank you,&apos;&quot; John said. He also thanked the &quot;strong and fearless&quot; girls on the trip for keeping calm and helping his wife, though they were &quot;scared out of their minds.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amber Lohr was treated for her wounds on the sidewalk before being taken to Bellevue Hospital. Surveillance video shows the suspect was still holding the knife when police officers arrived, the Post reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This man could have murdered my wife or even worse, one of the children she was chaperoning,&quot; John Lohr said. &quot;To think I could have been planning a funeral rather than celebrating my wife on Mother’s Day is sickening to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Destin, who reportedly resides in a shelter across the street from the crime scene, was charged with second-degree assault and fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York City Police Department&lt;/a&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has yet to be arraigned, according to District Attorney Alvin Bragg&apos;s office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police sources told the Post the suspect has a history of &quot;erratic and destructive behavior.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lohrs believe Destin is a danger to New York City and should be locked away where he cannot do more harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This man will strike again, and maybe the next person may not be as fortunate,&quot; John told the Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I will not accept anything but the max sentence for him,&quot; he added. &quot;This man doesn’t only need to be jailed but institutionalized permanently following his well-deserved lengthy sentencing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Greg Wehner contributed to this update.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Nobel literature winner Alice Munro, revered as short story master, dies at 92</title>
                    
                    <description>Nobel laureate Alice Munro has died. The Canadian literary giant who became one of the world’s most renowned contemporary authors was 92, officials say.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nobel laureate Alice Munro, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/canada&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Canadian&lt;/a&gt; literary giant who became one of the world’s most esteemed contemporary authors and one of history&apos;s most honored short story writers, has died at age 92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for publisher Penguin Random House Canada said Munro, winner of the Nobel literary prize in 2013, died Monday at home in Port Hope, Ontario. Munro had been in frail health for years and often spoke of retirement, a decision that proved final after the author&apos;s 2012 collection, &quot;Dear Life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often ranked with Anton Chekhov, John Cheever and a handful of other short story writers, Munro achieved stature rare for an art form traditionally placed beneath the novel. She was the first lifelong Canadian to win the Nobel and the first recipient cited exclusively for short fiction. Echoing the judgment of so many before, the Swedish academy pronounced her a &quot;master of the contemporary short story&quot; who could &quot;accommodate the entire epic complexity of the novel in just a few short pages.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/american-author-paul-auster-new-york-trilogy-dies-77&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMERICAN AUTHOR PAUL AUSTER, KNOWN FOR &apos;THE NEW YORK TRILOGY,&apos; DIES AT 77&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munro, little known beyond Canada until her late 30s, also became one of the few short story writers to enjoy ongoing commercial success. Sales in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/regions/north-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; alone exceeded 1 million copies and the Nobel announcement raised &quot;Dear Life&quot; to the high end of The New York Times&apos; bestseller list for paperback fiction. Other popular books included &quot;Too Much Happiness,&quot; &quot;The View from Castle Rock&quot; and &quot;The Love of a Good Woman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a half century of writing, Munro perfected one of the greatest tricks of any art form: illuminating the universal through the particular, creating stories set around Canada that appealed to readers far away. She produced no single definitive work, but dozens of classics that were showcases of wisdom, technique and talent — her inspired plot twists and artful shifts of time and perspective; her subtle, sometimes cutting humor; her summation of lives in broad dimension and fine detail; her insights into people across age or background, her genius for sketching a character, like the adulterous woman introduced as &quot;short, cushiony, dark-eyed, effusive. A stranger to irony.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her best known fiction included &quot;The Beggar&apos;s Maid,&quot; a courtship between an insecure young woman and an officious rich boy who becomes her husband; &quot;Corrie,&quot; in which a wealthy young woman has an affair with an architect &quot;equipped with a wife and young family&quot;; and &quot;The Moons of Jupiter,&quot; about a middle-aged writer who visits her ailing father in a Toronto hospital and shares memories of different parts of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think any life can be interesting,&quot; Munro said during a 2013 post-prize interview for the Nobel Foundation. &quot;I think any surroundings can be interesting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/cormac-mccarthy-pulitzer-prize-winning-author-the-road-dead-89&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORMAC MCCARTHY, PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING AUTHOR OF &apos;THE ROAD,&apos; DEAD AT 89&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disliking Munro, as a writer or as a person, seemed almost heretical. The wide and welcoming smile captured in her author photographs was complemented by a down-to-earth manner and eyes of acute alertness, fitting for a woman who seemed to pull stories out of the air the way songwriters discovered melodies. She was admired without apparent envy, placed by the likes of Jonathan Franzen, John Updike and Cynthia Ozick at the very top of the pantheon. Munro&apos;s daughter, Sheila Munro, wrote a memoir in which she confided that &quot;so unassailable is the truth of her fiction that sometimes I even feel as though I&apos;m living inside an Alice Munro story.&quot; Fellow Canadian author Margaret Atwood called her a pioneer for women, and for Canadians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Back in the 1950s and 60s, when Munro began, there was a feeling that not only female writers but Canadians were thought to be both trespassing and transgressing,&quot; Atwood wrote in a 2013 tribute published in the Guardian after Munro won the Nobel. &quot;The road to the Nobel wasn&apos;t an easy one for Munro: the odds that a literary star would emerge from her time and place would once have been zero.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although not overtly political, Munro witnessed and participated in the cultural revolution of the 1960s and &apos;70s and permitted her characters to do the same. She was a farmer&apos;s daughter who married young, then left her husband in the 1970s and took to &quot;wearing miniskirts and prancing around,&quot; as she recalled during a 2003 interview with The Associated Press. Many of her stories contrasted the generation of Munro&apos;s parents with the more open-ended lives of their children, departing from the years when housewives daydreamed &quot;between the walls that the husband was paying for.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moviegoers would become familiar with &quot;The Bear Came Over the Mountain,&quot; the improbably seamless tale of a married woman with memory loss who has an affair with a fellow nursing home patient, a story further complicated by her husband&apos;s many past infidelities. &quot;The Bear&quot; was adapted by director Sarah Polley into the feature film &quot;Away from Her,&quot; which brought an Academy Award nomination for Julie Christie. In 2014, Kristen Wiig starred in &quot;Hateship, Loveship,&quot; an adaptation of the story &quot;Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage,&quot; in which a housekeeper leaves her job and travels to a distant rural town to meet up with a man she believes is in love with her — unaware the romantic letters she has received were concocted by his daughter and a friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before the Nobel, Munro received honors from around the English-language world, including Britain&apos;s Man Booker International Prize and the National Book Critics Circle award in the U.S., where the American Academy of Arts and Letters voted her in as an honorary member. In Canada, she was a three-time winner of the Governor General&apos;s Award and a two-time winner of the Giller Prize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munro was a short story writer by choice, and, apparently, by design. Judith Jones, an editor at Alfred A. Knopf who worked with Updike and Anne Tyler, did not want to publish &quot;Lives of Girls &amp;amp; Women,&quot; her only novel, writing in an internal memo that &quot;there&apos;s no question the lady can write but it&apos;s also clear she is primarily a short story writer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munro would acknowledge that she didn&apos;t think like a novelist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have all these disconnected realities in my own life, and I see them in other people&apos;s lives,&quot; she told the AP. &quot;That was one of the problems, why I couldn&apos;t write novels. I never saw things hanging together too well.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice Ann Laidlaw was born in Wingham, Ontario, in 1931, and spent much of her childhood there, a time and place she often used in her fiction, including the four autobiographical pieces that concluded &quot;Dear Life.&quot; Her father was a fox farmer, her mother a teacher and the family’s fortunes shifted between middle class and working poor, giving the future author a special sensitivity to money and class. Young Alice was often absorbed in literature, starting with the first time she was read Hans Christian Andersen’s &quot;The Little Mermaid.&quot; She was a compulsive inventor of stories and the &quot;sort of child who reads walking upstairs and props a book in front of her when she does the dishes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A top student in high school, she received a scholarship to study at the University of Western Ontario, majoring in journalism as a &quot;cover-up&quot; for her pursuit of literature. She was still an undergraduate when she sold a story about a lonely teacher, &quot;The Dimensions of a Shadow,&quot; to CBC Radio. She was also publishing work in her school’s literary journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One fellow student read &quot;Dimensions&quot; and wrote to the then-Laidlaw, telling her the story reminded him of Chekhov. The student, Gerald Fremlin, would become her second husband. Another fellow student, James Munro, was her first husband. They married in 1951, when she was only 20, and had four children, one of whom died soon after birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Settling with her family &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/vancouver&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, Alice Munro wrote between trips to school, housework and helping her husband at the bookstore that they co-owned and would turn up in some of her stories. She wrote one book in the laundry room of her house, her typewriter placed near the washer and dryer. Flannery O’Connor, Carson McCullers and other writers from the American South inspired her, through their sense of place and their understanding of the strange and absurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolated from the literary center of Toronto, she did manage to get published in several literary magazines and to attract the attention of an editor at Ryerson Press (later bought out by McGraw Hill). Her debut collection, &quot;Dance of the Happy Shades,&quot; was released in 1968 with a first printing of just under 2,700 copies. A year later it won the Governor’s General Award and made Munro a national celebrity — and curiosity. &quot;Literary Fame Catches City Mother Unprepared,&quot; read one newspaper headline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When the book first came they sent me a half dozen copies. I put them in the closet. I didn’t look at them. I didn’t tell my husband they had come, because I couldn’t bear it. I was afraid it was terrible,&quot; Munro told the AP. &quot;And one night, he was away, and I forced myself to sit down and read it all the way through, and I didn’t think it was too bad. And I felt I could acknowledge it and it would be OK.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the early ’70s, she had left her husband, later observing that she was not &quot;prepared to be a submissive wife.&quot; Her changing life was best illustrated by her response to the annual Canadian census. For years, she had written down her occupation as &quot;housewife.&quot; In 1971, she switched to &quot;writer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next 40 years, her reputation and readership only grew, with many of her stories first appearing in The New Yorker. Her prose style was straightforward, her tone matter of fact, but her plots revealed unending disruption and disappointments: broken marriages, violent deaths, madness and dreams unfulfilled, or never even attempted. &quot;Canadian Gothic&quot; was one way she described the community of her childhood, a world she returned to when, in middle age, she and her second husband relocated to nearby Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Shame and embarrassment are driving forces for Munro’s characters,&quot; Atwood wrote, &quot;just as perfectionism in the writing has been a driving force for her: getting it down, getting it right, but also the impossibility of that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had the kind of curiosity that would have made her an ideal companion on a long train ride, imagining the lives of the other passengers. Munro wrote the story &quot;Friend of My Youth,&quot; in which a man has an affair with his fiancee’s sister and ends up living with both women, after an acquaintance told her about some neighbors who belonged to a religion that forbade card games. The author wanted to know more — about the religion, about the neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as a child, Munro had regarded the world as an adventure and mystery and herself as an observer, walking around Wingham and taking in the homes as if she were a tourist. In &quot;The Peace of Utrecht,&quot; an autobiographical story written in the late 1960s, a woman discovers an old high school notebook and remembers a dance she once attended with an intensity that would envelop her whole existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And now an experience which seemed not at all memorable at the time,&quot; Munro wrote, &quot;had been transformed into something curiously meaningful for me, and complete; it took in more than the girls dancing and the single street, it spread over the whole town, its rudimentary pattern of streets and its bare trees and muddy yards just free of the snow, over the dirt roads where the lights of cars appeared, jolting toward the town, under an immense pale wash of sky.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Sumatran tiger on the loose, believed to have killed man in Indonesia</title>
                    
                    <description>A man working on an Indonesian plantation last week was reportedly killed by a wild Sumatran tiger, according to reports. The tiger is still on the loose.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The hunt is underway for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sumatran tiger&lt;/a&gt; believed to have attacked a man in western Indonesia, killing him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The victim was identified by CBS News as being 26 years old. He was found dead at a plantation in the Riau province on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/asia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sumatra island&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday afternoon with a missing right hand and bite wounds on his neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local authorities received a notification from two workers that their friend was screaming, and that, when they searched for him, all they saw were tiger tracks, CBS reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our team has left this morning (to search for the tiger). Based on the report, the area is within the tiger habitat,&quot; local conservation agency head Genman Suhefti Hasibuan told Agence France Presse (AFP) on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/tiger-mauls-florida-man-airboat-attraction-authorities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIGER MAULS FLORIDA MAN AT AIRBOAT ATTRACTION, AUTHORITIES SAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AFP reported there are about several hundred wild tigers left on the western island of Sumatra due to being targeted by poachers and deforestation of their habitat for oil palm plantations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/arizona-state-engineering-graduates-drown-waterfall-days-commencement-hiking-trip-classmates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARIZONA STATE ENGINEERING GRADUATES DROWN IN WATERFALL DAYS AFTER CONVOCATION ON HIKING TRIP WITH CLASSMATES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sumatran tigers are carnivorous mammals whose life span in the wild is about 15 years, according to National Geographic. They can be as large as eight feet, and weight as much as 260 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week&apos;s tiger attack is one of three fatal incidents in the past five months, according to CBS News. A Siberian tiger reportedly attacked a dog and killed its owner in Russia in December. Last month, a man was killed by tigers at a zoo in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four farmers in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Indonesia&apos;s Aceh&lt;/a&gt; province were attacked by tigers in two separate incidents back in February, CBS reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Ella Riley Adler, 15, was killed in a hit-and-run boating accident while water skiing in the Florida Keys on Saturday, and authorities are searching for the boat.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Authorities have found a boat matching the description of the one that fatally struck a 15-year-old in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;South Florida&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ella Riley Adler was water skiing off Key Biscayne near Nixon Beach around 4:30 p.m. when she was struck by a center console boat with a light blue hull that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sped away from the scene&lt;/a&gt;, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) announced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She was wearing a life vest, as well as the ski boards on her feet,&quot; FWC spokesperson George Reynaud &lt;a href=&quot;https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/loved-ones-id-15-year-old-girl-killed-in-key-biscayne-waterskiing-crash-amid-search-for-boater/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;told WSVN.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A first responder said via radio transmissions that there was &quot;a lot of blood in the water,&quot; the outlet reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/2-teens-charged-dumping-trash-florida-sea-viral-video&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 TEENS CHARGES FOR DUMPING TRASH INTO FLORIDA SEA IN VIRAL VIDEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boat is in custody and the owner is cooperating with the investigation, which remains open, FWC said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our community suffered a great loss this Mother’s Day weekend,&quot; said FWC Chairman Rodney Barreto. &quot;I would like to thank all our officers and those from various law enforcement agencies who have worked and continue to work tirelessly on this investigation. The FWC and its officers have called in additional resources from other parts of the state and have worked around the clock to find the vessel involved in the accident.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 15-year-old was celebrating a friend&apos;s birthday on a family boat at the time of the crash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The boat has multiple white outboard motors and may have blue or dark blue bottom paint,&quot; FWC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/large-barge-crashes-historic-fort-madision-bridge-iowa-later-sinks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LARGE BARGE CRASHES INTO HISTORIC FORT MADISON BRIDGE IN IOWA, LATER SINKS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities said there is a total reward of up to $20,000 for information about the vessel and boater involved in the crash, including $5,000 from Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers. Witnesses have been asked to come forward to the FWC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adler was a student at Ransom Everglades School, and a member of its dance team. The high school freshman had been cast as a ballerina in &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; and had appeared in more than 100 performances with the Miami City Ballet at the Adrienne Arsht Center, according to her obituary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When she walked into a room, everyone was drawn to her,&quot; her family wrote. &quot;She loved to dance, she loved her friends, and most of all she loved her family.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/52-us-bound-migrants-apprehended-off-puerto-rico-packed-inside-rickety-boat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;52 US-BOARD MIGRANTS APPREHENDED OFF PUERTO RICO PACKED INSIDE RICKETY BOAT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adler&apos;s family wrote that she took pride in her Jewish heritage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She was the great-granddaughter of Holocaust survivors,&quot; her family said. &quot;She loved Israel and came from a long line of Jewish leaders with a strong commitment to faith and tikkun olam.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of the girl&apos;s friends left emotional tributes on her obituary page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At the beginning of this year when Ella joined the dance team, never would I imagine the impact she would have on me,&quot; friend Lauren Scott said. &quot;From her smile to her contagious laugh, when Ella walked into the studio there was no way not to share her joy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No one had ever made me feel so confident in myself or so happy to go to school, knowing that I was going to see her,&quot; friend Emma Fayad wrote. &quot;She had a way of making you believe everything she said, because you knew that you could always trust her and confide in her. I never thought that I would have to say goodbye, especially so soon. I will miss you so much, and I can only hope that you rest in peace.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the private school wrote that Ella was &quot;a wonderful dancer, served on the speech and debate team, and was a member of the Jewish Student Association,&quot; and that she &quot;was a treasured friend to many.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levina Cava extended her condolences to the Adler family on X, writing that the public should &quot;honor her memory by exercising better boat safety to ensure tragedies like this never happen again.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

It was f---ing torture.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the age of 15, Applegate&apos;s mother put her on Weight Watchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/christina-applegate-lives-kind-of-hell-following-multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHRISTINA APPLEGATE LIVES ‘KIND OF IN HELL’ FOLLOWING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS DIAGNOSIS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She was always competitive,&quot; the actress, now 52, said. &quot;If I got down to 110 [pounds….], she&apos;d be like... &apos;How&apos;d you do it?&apos; And the reason was, I finally had an eating disorder. I would eat five almonds in a day. And if I had six, I would cry, and I wouldn&apos;t want to leave the house. And that stuck with me for years and years and years.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While portraying Kelly Bundy on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/married-with-children-star-ted-mcginley-admits-one-of-largest-faults-life&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Married with Children,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Applegate wanted to look skinny in the short skirts and revealing clothing she chose for her character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wanted my bones to be sticking out, so I didn&apos;t eat,&quot; she confessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applegate&apos;s eating disorder did not go unnoticed at the time, but this is the first time the &quot;Dead to Me&quot; star has spoken about the issue publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was very scary to everyone on set because they were like, &apos;Christina never eats.&apos; And I didn&apos;t. They talked to me about it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The costume department was altering her outfits to be smaller than size zero, according to Applegate. &quot;But to me, I was enormous.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applegate revealed she is still struggling with body image issues after her multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis caused weight gain. She gained 45 pounds from side effects from the disease and the medication she takes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That demon in my head, it&apos;s coming back really loud. And it&apos;s scaring me,&quot; she noted. &quot;It hasn&apos;t been there for a long time. I mean, it&apos;s always a little bit there with anorexia as long as I did in my early life. It always plagues me. And then body dysmorphia and all of those things. They&apos;re still always there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t look in mirrors,&quot; Applegate continued. &quot;This is obviously something people don&apos;t know. I have writing all over my mirrors in my bathroom so that I don&apos;t look in them. Because I will like fall on the ground and cry.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applegate has used humor as a defense mechanism while attending events since gaining weight, telling the audience at the 2024 Emmy Awards that she had a &quot;body not by Ozempic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I made jokes at the Emmys because I wanted to say, ‘I know what you’re thinking,&apos;&quot; she explained as she became emotional. &quot;Had to say that because it was like I could see what they were thinking … I was so humiliated,&quot; she explained. &quot;That&apos;s the demon. The demon is saying these things to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sigler also struggled with body image issues at the age of 16, she revealed in the podcast episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was around that time and all my friends were talking about food and calories,&quot; she recalled from her teen years. &quot;Their bodies were changing and they were growing. And I remember I was on birth control at the time and I had gained weight from that, filled out a bit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I just started taking note,&quot; she said, of the way her friends watched their weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actress, now 42, first noticed her body after watching herself in the pilot episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sopranos-star-jamie-lynn-sigler-ms-prevents-giving-kids-all-they-want&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;The Sopranos.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was the fullest I had been ever. I didn&apos;t look like any other young woman on any other show that I&apos;d seen,&quot; she explained. &quot;There was a year between the pilot and the first episode and during that time, I had the eating disorder.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sigler admitted she suffered from exercise bulimia, which uses &quot;excessive exercise as a compensatory behavior after binging episodes, or even just after eating,&quot; according to The Bulimia Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Every notebook, if you had a notebook from my sophomore and junior year of high school has like little numbers on the corner of it, just calculating food and calories,&quot; she admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between filming for the pilot and season one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sopranos-star-james-gandolfini-would-question-himself-set-jamie-lynn-sigler&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;The Sopranos,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Sigler said she got down to 80 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They almost fired me because of how thin I was,&quot; she admitted. &quot;They were like, &apos;whoa, no, no, no, no, no!&quot; The show was so supportive and loving, and they just wanted me healthy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Biden doesn&apos;t support &apos;full-term&apos; abortion stance pushed by RFK Jr, campaign says</title>
                    
                    <description>President Biden&amp;apos;s re-election campaign said Tuesday that the president does not support full-term abortions, drawing contrast between remarks made recently by Robert F Kennedy Jr.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;President Biden&apos;s re-election campaign said Tuesday that the president does not support &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/abortion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;full-term abortions&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, drawing a contrast between a stance recently taken by one of his challengers in the race for the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital asked the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden campaign&lt;/a&gt; this week whether it agrees with remarks made last week by independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who said he opposes any government restrictions on abortions, &quot;even if it&apos;s full-term.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, the president doesn&apos;t support full-term abortions, as he&apos;s made clear many times. He thinks Roe got it right,&quot; said Lauren Hitt, a senior spokesperson for the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following initial outreach to the Biden campaign, Fox News Digital received a statement on the matter from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/democratic-party&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Democratic National Committee&lt;/a&gt; (DNC) spokesperson, who claimed Kennedy &quot;can’t be trusted to stand up for reproductive freedom.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-blasted-claiming-abortion-3-trimesters-demand-biden-think-4th&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN BLASTED FOR CLAIMING ABORTION FOR &apos;3 TRIMESTERS&apos; IS NOT &apos;ON DEMAND&apos;: &apos;DOES BIDEN THINK THERE’S A 4TH?&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He’s said he would sign a national abortion ban and has repeatedly dismissed the importance of abortion rights on the campaign trail,&quot; DNC communications adviser Lis Smith said in the statement. &quot;With reproductive freedom under attack, we need leaders who will stand strong for women. It’s clear that neither RFK Jr. nor Trump will.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abortion has become a major issue on the campaign trail since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-overturns-roe-v-wade-dobbs-v-jackson-womens-health-organization&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Supreme Court&apos;s landmark decision&lt;/a&gt; in June 2022 to overturn Roe v. Wade and return the issue to the states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic campaigns have made abortion a cornerstone of political messaging, and Biden has repeatedly hammered former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Trump&lt;/a&gt; over the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an April 23 speech at Hillsborough Community College in Tampa, Florida, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/04/23/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-campaign-event-tampa-fl-2/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Biden claimed&lt;/a&gt; it was Trump who &quot;ripped away the rights of freedom of women in America.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It will be all of us who restore those rights for women in America,&quot; he added at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Republican states have passed legislation limiting abortion, while Democrats have successfully won ballot initiatives in various states to allow for abortion procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appearing on Wednesday&apos;s installment of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/sage-steele-off-sidelines-speaking-her-mind&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Sage Steele Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; Kennedy was pressed about this abortion stance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy clashed with Steele over late-term abortions, insisting they are extremely rare and that there are usually &quot;extenuating circumstances&quot; behind those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-makes-sign-of-the-cross-during-pro-abortion-speech-in-florida&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN MAKES SIGN OF THE CROSS DURING PRO-ABORTION SPEECH IN FLORIDA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think there&apos;s a really, really good argument, a compelling argument, that the state has an interest in protecting a fully-formed fetus. I absolutely think that that argument is very convincing. But again, I come down to the fact that I don&apos;t trust the state,&quot; Kennedy said. &quot;I think we need to trust the woman and I don&apos;t think that that&apos;s a satisfactory outcome, because there&apos;s always gonna be instances where bad things happen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So, in other words, keeping it as is with Roe v. Wade having been overturned and leaving it up to the states to determine if and when a woman can have an abortion,&quot; Steele followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, I wouldn&apos;t leave it to the states,&quot; Kennedy responded. &quot;We should leave it to the woman. We shouldn&apos;t have government involved.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even if it&apos;s full-term,&quot; Steele said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even if it&apos;s full-term,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/rfk-jr-says-supports-abortion-even-full-term&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kennedy replied&lt;/a&gt;, later adding, &quot;I think we have to leave it to the woman, not the state. I think we should do everything in our power to make sure that never happens and everything that we can do. But I think, ultimately, you know, nobody sets out to do that. And there are always some kind of extenuating circumstances that would make a mother make that kind of choice, a terrible, terrible choice which is, you know, you can&apos;t overstate how bad that is. And I think, ultimately, we have to trust women.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy&apos;s abortion stance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;made headlines last year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after NBC News reported that he supported limiting abortions to 15 or 21 weeks into the pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-says-support-federal-ban-abortions-beyond-months-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;campaign later clarified his position,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; alleging he misunderstood the question, saying in a statement, &quot;He does not support legislation banning abortion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Joseph A. Wulfsohn contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Ryan Delanty, a former University of Missouri fraternity member, has pleaded guilty to supplying liquor to a minor and misdemeanor hazing, officials say.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A former member of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/college&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;University of Missouri&lt;/a&gt; fraternity has pleaded guilty in the hazing of another student that caused blindness and significant brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan P. Delanty of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/missouri&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Manchester, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, pleaded guilty Friday in Boone County to supplying liquor to a minor and misdemeanor hazing, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors will recommend a six-month jail sentence followed by six months of house arrest. Sentencing is May 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hazing in October 2021 at a Phi Gamma Delta fraternity event left freshman Danny Santulli unable to see, walk or speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/mizzou-fraternity-brothers-charged-felonies-hazing-pledge-blind-paralyzed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 EX-MIZZOU FRATERNITY BROTHERS CHARGED WITH FELONIES AFTER HAZING INCIDENT LEFT PLEDGE BLIND, PARALYZED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ryan understands the gravity of the situation, and he’s pleased to reach a resolution that avoided a trial,&quot; said Delanty’s lawyer, Stephanie Fortus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santulli was pledging the fraternity in October when he was found unresponsive due to alcohol poisoning. Authorities said his blood alcohol content was 0.486, six times the legal limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fraternity chapter was shut down. Santulli&apos;s relatives filed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;civil lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the fraternity and 23 members. It was settled for an unspecified amount in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another fraternity member, Thomas Shultz of Chesterfield, Missouri, pleaded guilty in April to supplying liquor to a minor. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, two years of probation, and was ordered to perform community service and complete a drug and alcohol education program.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Georgian parliament passes &apos;Russia law&apos; aimed at curbing foreign influence after weeks of mass protests</title>
                    
                    <description>Georgia&amp;apos;s parliament approved the controversial so-called &amp;quot;Russia law,&amp;quot; which aims to decrease foreign influence in media, after weeks of mass demonstrations against it.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Georgian parliament on Tuesday approved in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/georgian-parliament-holds-final-reading-divisive-russian-law-proposal-foreign-influence-media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;third and final reading&lt;/a&gt; a divisive bill that sparked weeks of mass protests, with critics seeing it as a threat to democratic freedoms and the country’s aspirations to join the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill requires media and nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofits to register as &quot;pursuing the interests of a foreign power&quot; if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government says the bill is necessary to stem what it deems as harmful foreign influence over the country’s politics and to prevent unspecified foreign actors from trying to destabilize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/georgia-police-arrest-dozens-protesting-russian-law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GEORGIA POLICE ARREST DOZENS PROTESTING &apos;RUSSIAN LAW&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opposition has denounced the bill as &quot;the Russian law,&quot; because Moscow uses similar legislation to crack down on independent news media, nonprofits and activists critical of the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mass protests against the law in recent weeks have swept the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European Council President Charles Michel on Tuesday spoke of Georgia in Copenhagen, at a conference on democracy, and said that &quot;if they want to join the EU, they have to respect the fundamental principles of the rule of law and the democratic principles.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill is nearly identical to one that the governing Georgian Dream party was pressured to withdraw last year after street protests. Renewed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/georgians-protest-proposed-law-restricting-foreign-influence-media-parliament-approves-final-vote&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;demonstrations have rocked Georgia for weeks&lt;/a&gt;, with demonstrators scuffling with police, who used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, who is increasingly at odds with the governing party, has vowed to veto the law, but Georgian Dream has a majority sufficient to override a presidential veto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the lawmakers began debating the bill on Tuesday, a large crowd of demonstrators gathered in front of the parliament to protest once again, with a heavy presence of riot police at the site. Over the weekend, thousands poured into the streets of the Georgian capital Tbilisi, and many stayed in front of the parliament until Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the parliament, the debate was interrupted by a brawl. Georgian Dream MP Dimitry Samkharadze was seen charging toward Levan Khabeishvili, the chairman of main opposition party United National Movement, after Khabeishvili accused him of organizing mobs to beat up opposition supporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent days, several protesters and opposition members have been beaten up. The opposition &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/georgian-opposition-parties-urge-mass-protests-against-russian-bill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;linked the incidents to the protests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Georgian Dream lawmaker, Archil Talakvadze, accused in his speech on Tuesday &quot;the radical and anti-national political opposition united by political vendetta&quot; of using the protests for their own political purpose and &quot;hoping for events to take a radical turn.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But nothing and nobody can stop the development of our country,&quot; Talakvadze said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ana Tsitlidze, a member of the United National Movement, said the protests showed how unified Georgia was &quot;in fighting for its European future,&quot; adding that &quot;today, saying no to the Russian law equals saying no to the Russian regime.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the debate, 84 lawmakers out of 116 attending Tuesday&apos;s session voted in favor of the law, and 30 voted against. It will now be sent to Zourabichvili, the president, and she has 14 days to either veto or approve it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>AI is permeating American culture, but radiologists hesitant to place patients&apos; health in an algorithm&apos;s hands</title>
                    
                    <description>Some doctors are hesitant to employ AI programs in their practices, even as the FDA approves more algorithms to assist them in detecting tumors or completing less important tasks.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How good would an algorithm have to be to take over your job?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a new question for many workers amid the rise of ChatGPT and other AI programs that can hold conversations, write stories and even generate songs and images within seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For doctors who review scans to spot cancer and other diseases, however, AI has loomed for about a decade as more algorithms promise to improve accuracy, speed up work and, in some cases, take over entire parts of the job. Predictions have ranged from doomsday scenarios in which AI fully replaces radiologists, to sunny futures in which it frees them to focus on the most rewarding aspects of their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/ai-tech-aims-detect-breast-cancer-mimicking-radiologists-eye-movements-critical-friend&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI TECH AIMS TO DETECT BREAST CANCER BY MIMICKING RADIOLOGISTS’ EYE MOVEMENTS: &apos;A CRITICAL FRIEND&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That tension reflects how AI is rolling out across &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/health-care&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;health care&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond the technology itself, much depends upon the willingness of doctors to put their trust — and their patients’ health — in the hands of increasingly sophisticated algorithms that few understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even within the field, opinions differ on how much radiologists should be embracing the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some of the AI techniques are so good, frankly, I think we should be doing them now,&quot; said Dr. Ronald Summers, a radiologist and AI researcher at the National Institutes of Health. &quot;Why are we letting that information just sit on the table?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summers’ lab has developed computer-aided imaging programs that detect colon cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes and other conditions. None of those have been widely adopted, which he attributes to the &quot;culture of medicine,&quot; among other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiologists have used computers to enhance images and flag suspicious areas since the 1990s. But the latest AI programs can go much further, interpreting the scans, offering a diagnosis and even drafting written reports about their findings. The algorithms are often trained on millions of X-rays and other images collected from hospitals and clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across medicine, the FDA has OK’d more than 700 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/more-doctors-use-chatgpt-help-busy-workloads-ai-reliable-assistant&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;AI algorithms to aid physicians&lt;/a&gt;. More than 75% of them are in radiology, yet just 2% of radiology practices use such technology, according to one recent estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the promises from industry, radiologists see a number of reasons to be skeptical of AI programs: limited testing in real-world settings, lack of transparency about how they work and questions about the demographics of the patients used to train them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/artificial-intelligence-not-always-helpful-reducing-doctor-burnout-studies-suggest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE NOT ALWAYS HELPFUL FOR REDUCING DOCTOR BURNOUT, STUDIES SUGGEST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If we don’t know on what cases the AI was tested, or whether those cases are similar to the kinds of patients we see in our practice, there’s just a question in everyone’s mind as to whether these are going to work for us,&quot; said Dr. Curtis Langlotz, a radiologist who runs an AI research center at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, all the programs cleared by the FDA require a human to be in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2020, the FDA held a two-day workshop to discuss algorithms that could operate without human oversight. Shortly afterwards, radiology professionals warned regulators in a letter that they &quot;strongly believe it is premature for the FDA to consider approval or clearance&quot; of such systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But European regulators in 2022 approved the first fully automatic software that reviews and writes reports for chest X-rays that look healthy and normal. The company behind the app, Oxipit, is submitting its U.S. application to the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need for such technology in Europe is urgent, with some hospitals facing monthslong backlogs of scans due to a shortage of radiologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., that kind of automated screening is likely years away. Not because the technology isn’t ready, according to AI executives, but because radiologists aren’t yet comfortable turning over even routine tasks to algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We try to tell them they’re overtreating people and they’re wasting a ton of time and resources,&quot; said Chad McClennan, CEO of Koios Medical, which sells an AI tool for ultrasounds of the thyroid, the vast majority of which are not cancerous. &quot;We tell them, ‘Let the machine look at it, you sign the report and be done with it.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiologists tend to overestimate their own accuracy, McClennan says. Research by his company found physicians viewing the same breast scans disagreed with each other more than 30% of the time on whether to do a biopsy. The same radiologists even disagreed with their own initial assessments 20% of the time, when viewing the same images a month later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 20% of breast cancers are missed during routine mammograms, according to the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there&apos;s the potential for cost savings. On average, U.S. radiologists earn over $350,000 annually, according to the Department of Labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the near term, experts say AI will work like autopilot systems on planes — performing important navigation functions, but always under the supervision of a human pilot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach offers reassurances to both radiologists and patients, says Dr. Laurie Margolies, of Mount Sinai hospital system in New York. The system uses Koios breast imaging AI to get a second opinion on mammography ultrasounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I will tell patients, ‘I looked at it, and the computer looked at it, and we both agree,’&quot; Margolies said. &quot;Hearing me say that we both agree, I think that gives the patient an even greater level of confidence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first large, rigorous trials testing AI-assisted radiologists against those working alone give hints at the potential improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial results from a Swedish study of 80,000 women showed a single radiologist working with AI detected 20% more cancers among mammograms than two radiologists working without the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, mammograms are reviewed by two radiologists to improve accuracy. But Sweden, like other countries, faces a workforce shortage, with only about 70 breast radiologists in a country of 10 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using AI instead of a second reviewer decreased the human workload by 44%, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the study’s lead author says it&apos;s essential that a radiologist make the final diagnosis in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an automated algorithm misses a cancer, &quot;that’s going to be very negative for trust in the caregiver,&quot; said Dr. Kristina Lang of Lund University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question of who would be held liable in such cases is among the thorny legal issues that have yet to be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One result is that radiologists are likely to continue double-checking all AI determinations, lest they be held responsible for an error. That’s likely to wipe out many of the predicted benefits, including reduced workload and burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only an extremely accurate, reliable algorithm would allow radiologists to truly step away from the process, says Dr. Saurabh Jha of the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until such systems emerge, Jha likens &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/artificial-intelligence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;AI-assisted radiology&lt;/a&gt; to someone who offers to help you drive by looking over your shoulder and constantly pointing out everything on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That’s not helpful,&quot; Jha says. &quot;If you want to help me drive then you take over the driving so that I can sit back and relax.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>California man trolls city officials with &apos;artistic statement&apos; after being asked to fence in his boat</title>
                    
                    <description>A California man told Fox News Digital that he had a boat mural painted onto his fence after city officials demanded he build a barrier for his boat. The art attracted attention online.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A California boat owner became a local celebrity after he decided to stick it to city officials who asked him to build a fence around his boat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Etienne Constable, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Seaside, California,&lt;/a&gt; resident, owns a boat that he had kept parked on a dirt patch on his property. In July 2023, officials asked him to build a proper driveway and to put up a 6-foot-tall fence that covered his boat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Fox News Digital on Monday, Constable explained that he &quot;wasn&apos;t looking for a private property rights fight with the city,&quot; but disagreed with officials for thinking his boat was an eyesore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/50-bizarre-laws-existed-or-still-exist-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50 BIZARRE LAWS THAT HAVE EXISTED OR STILL EXIST IN AMERICA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&apos;s some logic to the law about, you know, not having decrepit vehicles….and I figured, &apos;This is not unsightly.&apos; I don&apos;t know why they would threaten me that way,&quot; he recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I just figured there&apos;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/first-amendment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; right of writing whatever statement I want, on whatever property I have,&quot; he continued. &quot;So, yeah, just kind of standing up for myself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constable ended up complying with the city by building a fence, but he decided to have some fun with it by commissioning a life-like mural on the structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The art is arguably so realistic that, at a quick glance, it almost appears that the fence isn&apos;t there at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/privacy-fence-options&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 PRIVACY FENCE OPTIONS FOR YOUR DECK, PATIO OR BACKYARD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constable explained that he wanted to avoid having an unattractive fence, opting for a look that was more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I just thought, &apos;Here&apos;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;creative way&lt;/a&gt; to make a statement.&apos; And [as] an artistic statement, it&apos;s open to many interpretations, and I think that&apos;s part of the beauty of it,&quot; Constable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constable got in touch with a local artist named Hanif Panni, who happens to be his neighbor, to help bring the idea to life. The City of Seaside appeared to applaud Constable and Panni&apos;s creativity, according to a Facebook post on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Seaside resident got creative when complying to the municipal code to hide his boat with a fence,&quot; the post&apos;s caption read. &quot;He turned lemons into lemonade and had his artist neighbor paint a hyperrealistic mural of the boat on the fence itself!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The result? A optical illusion and a whole lot of media attention,&quot; the post continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constable admitted that his stunt got much more attention than he expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was ready for whatever reaction might come, although I certainly wasn&apos;t ready for this thing to go viral like it has … I didn&apos;t know how the city would react,&quot; he told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I got a call from the acting city manager/police chief and he said, &apos;Dude, you&apos;re hilarious. I&apos;d give you a high-five. I&apos;d love to meet you someday. And, you know, if you need anything, let me know.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constable, whose community is just outside of Monterey, says that the attention he&apos;s received from locals has been overwhelmingly positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ninety-nine percent of everybody else in this community thought it was hilarious, and [thought] that there&apos;s some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/odd-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;silly laws&lt;/a&gt; on the books. Why do we make each other suffer in this way for whatever reason?&quot; he said with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Constable did not conceal his boat, he would have had to pay a first offense fine of $100, The Los Angeles Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to Seaside Mayor Ian Oglesby for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Bill Maher, Bill Burr have tense exchange over Israel: &apos;Why am I f-----g listening to you?&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Bill Maher and Bill Burr had tense exchange over the ongoing Israel-Palestinian conflict during an episode of Maher’s weekly &amp;quot;Club Random&amp;quot; podcast.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Comedians &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/maher-torches-bidens-student-loan-handout-my-tax-dollars-supporting-jew-hating&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Bill Maher&lt;/a&gt; and Bill Burr had a tense exchange over the ongoing Israel-Palestinian conflict, with Burr at one point asking, &quot;Why am I f-----g listening to you&quot; on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maher said that college campuses throughout America had people &quot;demonstrating for Hamas&quot; when Burr cut him off during an otherwise cordial episode of Maher’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1V2nsKUeX8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Club Random&quot; podcast&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They were for the Palestinians,&quot; Burr said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, it’s sort of the same cause,&quot; Maher shot back, asking &quot;Are you?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-says-wont-f-ing-nuts-get-anxious-millennial-trump-wins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BILL MAHER SAYS HE WON&apos;T &apos;GO F---ING NUTS AGAIN&apos; AND &apos;GET ANXIOUS LIKE A MILLENNIAL&apos; IF TRUMP WINS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burr said he was &quot;on the side of the kids,&quot; seemingly referring to those in Gaza, which appeared to irk Maher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s easy to say, ‘I’m for the kids,’&quot; Maher said. &quot;Who’s not for the kids? It comes down to real hard-nosed decisions… Israel got attacked.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They’re the only country in the world that, they get attacked, and as soon as they counterattack it’s like, ‘Well we gotta stop this s—t now,’&quot; Maher said. &quot;Don’t attack them. There is a very simple solution to all these problems in the Middle East. Stop attacking Israel.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You just solved it,&quot; Burr joked. &quot;Let’s go to Russia and the Ukraine. How do you solve that one, Bill?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/maher-torches-bidens-student-loan-handout-my-tax-dollars-supporting-jew-hating&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MAHER TORCHES BIDEN&apos;S STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT: ‘MY TAX DOLLARS ARE SUPPORTING THIS JEW HATRED? I DON&apos;T THINK SO!&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burr then asked how war is even &quot;still legal&quot; with &quot;all the s—t that’s been canceled&quot; in recent years. Maher offered a real answer, saying it would be impossible to enforce a no-war scenario without going to war over it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What would be the sense in making it illegal? That’s really going to stop Putin? No,&quot; Maher said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burr joked that Putin should do a podcast with Ukrainian President &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/volodymyr-zelenskyy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Volodymyr Zelenskyy&lt;/a&gt; to hash things out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-fumes-merrick-garland-attorney-general-barney-fife-sucks-job&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BILL MAHER FUMES OVER MERRICK GARLAND: ‘ATTORNEY GENERAL BARNEY FIFE’ ‘SUCKS’ AT HIS JOB&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You just solved the Middle East on a podcast,&quot; Burr said. &quot;Why can’t they solve what they’re doing on a podcast?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maher said, &quot;This is why this is not your thing,&quot; drawing a fiery response from Burr. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;It isn’t &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; thing. It isn’t. You’re like that guy that has a fantasy football team and thinks he’s a f-----g GM. That’s exactly what it is,&quot; Burr shot back. &quot;Like, why am I f-----g listening to you like you like you’ve done something? What have you done in Washington? Nothing.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comedians quickly moved on, and went on to discuss other topics for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;remainder of the podcast&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>An attack on a prison convoy in northwestern France has left two prison officers dead and three others seriously injured, according to French authorities.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Armed assailants killed two French &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;prison officers&lt;/a&gt; and seriously wounded three others in an attack on a convoy in Normandy on Tuesday and an inmate escaped, officials said. A search was underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The convoy was transporting prisoner Mohamed Amra to Évreux jail after a court hearing in Rouen when it was ambushed on the A154 freeway, which has been closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All means are being used to find these criminals. On my instructions, several hundred police officers and gendarmes were mobilized,&quot; Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin posted on social platform X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/ohio-police-officer-military-veteran-killed-line-duty-ambush-suspect-at-large&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OHIO POLICE OFFICER, MILITARY VETERAN KILLED IN LINE-OF-DUTY AMBUSH, SUSPECT FOUND DEAD: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French President Emmanuel Macron in a post on X called the attack &quot;a shock for all of us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities worked to secure the area in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/france&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;northwestern France&lt;/a&gt; and apprehend the assailants. It was not clear how many were involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amra was detained at the Val de Reuil prison center near Rouen following his recent sentencing for burglary. He was also under investigation for a kidnapping and homicide case in Marseille, according to public prosecutor Laure Beccuau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French media reported that Amra was nicknamed &quot;La Mouche&quot; (The Fly).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beccuau announced an investigation into the attack, considered a case of organized crime and murder, and said two of the wounded officers were in critical condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation will also address organized escape attempts, possession of military-grade weapons and conspiracy to commit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a crime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A missile fired by a drone struck a house in a former stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban in northwestern Pakistan along the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/afghanistan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Afghan border&lt;/a&gt; before dawn Tuesday, killing at least four villagers, including children, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strike happened in South Waziristan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, local police chief Hidayat Ullah said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it was not immediately clear who fired the missile and officers were investigating. The Pakistan army evicted Pakistani Taliban insurgents from the region years ago, but they have been regrouping there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/pakistan-us-discuss-how-tackle-regional-security-threat-posed-is-group-local-taliban&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAKISTAN, US DISCUSS HOW TO TACKLE THE REGIONAL SECURITY THREAT POSED BY IS GROUP AND LOCAL TALIBAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those killed in the missile strike were civilians with no known links to the insurgents. Villagers put their bodies on a road near a military camp and protested the killings and demanded information about who was responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the previous drone strikes in the area were carried out by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; or the Pakistan army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no immediate comment from the government or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the military&lt;/a&gt; about the strike. The Pakistani Taliban, officially known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, is separate from but a close ally of the Afghan Taliban. It has been emboldened by the Afghan Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Trump could get Congressional Gold Medal under new House GOP resolution</title>
                    
                    <description>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna introduced a new resolution on Tuesday to give former President Trump the Congressional Gold Medal.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST ON FOX:&lt;/strong&gt; A group of House Republicans wants to award former President Trump the Congressional Gold Medal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., is leading a Congressional resolution to bestow the honor on Trump &quot;in recognition of his exceptional leadership and dedication to strengthening America&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/president-trump-foreign-policy-pledges&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;diplomatic relations&lt;/a&gt; during his presidency,&quot; according to legislative text obtained by Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is backed by six fellow House Republicans, including House GOP Deputy Whip Guy Reschenthaler of Pennsylvania, and Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Andy Ogles of Tennessee, Randy Weber of Texas and Mike Waltz of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/may-14-trump-trial-new-york-michael-cohen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL COHEN TESTIMONY TO CONTINUE AFTER EX-LAWYER REVEALS SECRET RECORDINGS OF TRUMP IN NY TRIAL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;President Trump’s fearless leadership reestablished America as a respected and admired global power,&quot; Luna told Fox News Digital. &quot;It is time we recognize a president who put our country first and secured global peace through bold diplomacy. Despite the liberal media&apos;s attempts to spread fear, America and the world were undoubtedly safer under President Donald Trump. One of our duties in Congress is to honor those who have contributed significantly to our nation, and that’s why I’m introducing this legislation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, it is also co-sponsored by House Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good, R-Va., who had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-backs-challenger-freedom-caucus-chair-2024-stirs-house-gop-civil-war&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;rocky relationship&lt;/a&gt; with some members of Trump&apos;s orbit earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/massive-trump-beach-rally-deep-blue-nj-draws-stark-contrast-bidens-beach-weekend-biden-could-never&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MASSIVE TRUMP BEACH RALLY IN DEEP-BLUE NJ DRAWS STARK CONTRAST TO BIDEN&apos;S BEACH WEEKEND: &apos;BIDEN COULD NEVER&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good originally endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president before backing Trump when the former dropped out. He has since emphatically thrown himself behind the ex-president&apos;s re-election bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;President Trump did more in four years on behalf of the American people than any president in my lifetime. He secured our border, achieved historic peace in the Middle East, and implemented policies that helped our economy prosper,&quot; said Good. &quot;The last three years of a failed Biden administration have only served as a stark contrast to President Trump&apos;s record.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Ogles hailed Trump&apos;s &quot;contributions to the American heritage and stalwart defense of the American way of life&quot; and Weber said &quot;every patriotic American knows our country was unequivocally better off four years ago under his stewardship.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-highly-conflicted-judge-after-first-day-michael-cohens-testimony-wraps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP BLASTS &apos;HIGHLY CONFLICTED&apos; JUDGE AFTER MICHAEL COHEN&apos;S FIRST DAY OF TESTIMONY WRAPS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is highly unlikely that the Democrat-controlled Senate will take the bill up, but it is more evidence that Trump remains the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-push-rename-dc-international-airport-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;de facto leader&lt;/a&gt; of the GOP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian award in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

McIlroy’s attorney told Fox News Digital he doesn&apos;t comment on pending lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rory and Erica started dating in 2015 after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/golf/pga-tour&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;PGA Tour&lt;/a&gt; star and tennis star Caroline Wozniacki broke off their engagement in May 2014. Rory and Erica became engaged later in 2015 and married in April 2017. They share one child together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erica McIlroy was a former PGA of America employee. She was seen by his side at several tournaments, including last year’s Ryder Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/scottie-scheffler-wife-meredith-welcome-baby-boy-ahead-pga-championship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCOTTIE SCHEFFLER, WIFE MEREDITH WELCOME BABY BOY AHEAD OF PGA CHAMPIONSHIP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Northern Irishman is fresh off of a win at the Wells Fargo Championship and is building momentum heading into the PGA Championship this weekend. He also won the Zurch Classic with Shane Lowry in a playoff back in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has 26 wins on the PGA Tour, including the two in 2024. He has four major victories, with the last one coming in the 2014 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/golf/pga-championship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;PGA Championship&lt;/a&gt;. He has two of those titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McIlroy is also in the middle of the PGA Tour’s squabble with LIV Golf. He resigned from the PGA Tour board in November as officials tried to work on a merger agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Voters will determine the Republican nominee in a heated race for Congress in West Virginia that&amp;apos;s seen the top two candidates lob major attacks at one another.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Candidates in a heated House race gaining national attention are facing the will of voters today as one aims to make history and the other tries to keep his family&apos;s legacy alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veteran Air Force Brig. Gen. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/veteran-air-force-pilot-joins-race-congress-moment-too-important-career-politicians&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chris &quot;Mookie&quot; Walker&lt;/a&gt; and West Virginia state Treasurer Riley Moore, the top two candidates in a crowded Republican primary for West Virginia&apos;s deep-red 2nd Congressional District, have battled for months to win over the large majority of conservative voters in the district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker, a Republican who was the first Black man to hold a general&apos;s rank in the West Virginia National Guard, would likely also be the first Black man from the state elected to Congress if he wins Tuesday&apos;s primary, while Moore, whose family includes a number of former elected officials, would secure a continuation of that political legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/racial-slur-alleged-threat-execute-man-top-five-wackiest-moments-top-democrat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RACIAL SLUR, ALLEGED THREAT TO ‘EXECUTE’ MAN: WATCH MOST OUTRAGEOUS MOMENTS FROM THIS DEM SENATE CANDIDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker has sought to paint Moore as part of a &quot;political dynasty,&quot; calling for West Virginians to send a non-career politician &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/washington-dc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look, I respect Riley Moore. I appreciate what he&apos;s done in state government as the state treasurer, but in my opinion, and a lot of people&apos;s opinions, dynasties don&apos;t work. Just because his grandfather was a former governor doesn&apos;t make him best qualified,&quot; he told Fox News Digital ahead of his campaign launch in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think that this moment is too important to send another career politician to Washington, D.C. Again, I&apos;m a pugilist. For all the things that are important to West Virginians, I will be the thorn in the side of the left, whereas others are, I think, going to just be there meekly casting votes,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-hopes-flipping-senate-democrats-major-roadblock-biden-swing-state-trouble-polls&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN FACING UPHILL BATTLE IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES AS DOWN-BALLOT DEMS LEAD: POLL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore, on the other hand, has largely ignored Walker on the campaign trail, instead focusing on his campaign&apos;s America First message and pledges to stand up against the policies being pushed by Democrats and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden administration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker and Moore have run neck-and-neck on dollars spent on the race, while the former has tried to gain the advantage by tying the latter to his time working in the &quot;swamp&quot; of Washington, D.C., an often-used line to blast career politicians and those with deep ties to government-related work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Walker criticized Moore for his time working as a lobbyist at the controversial – and now-defunct – Podesta Group, claiming he represented &quot;dictators and despots and anti-American zealots,&quot; including the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-veepstakes-pros-cons-south-dakota-governor-kristi-noem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP VEEPSTAKES: THE PROS AND CONS OF SOUTH DAKOTA GOV. KRISTI NOEM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears no evidence exists linking Moore to any work directly with the CCP, although it has been reported that the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, a client of the Podesta Group at the time of Moore&apos;s employment, was heavily influenced by party members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore&apos;s campaign pushed back on Walker&apos;s claims, accusing him of lying. It also accused Walker of lying about his service in the Air Force, claiming he never flew in combat. Walker, in fact, served extensively in combat, according to military records reviewed by Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;West Virginians should vote for me for one simple reason – values. I spent my life defending America around the globe, and I&apos;ve run this campaign on that record of service and sacrifice. My opponent has only ever looked out for himself. We deserve so much better,&quot; Walker told Fox News Digital on Tuesday as voters headed to the polls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Riley Moore is the only proven conservative in this race, with a record of fighting and winning for West Virginians. They know him, they trust him, and they’re ready to send him to Congress, where he’ll fight for them every single day,&quot; a spokesperson for Moore told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker and Moore face a crowded Republican primary field that includes Army veterans Dennis Cain and Joseph Early, as well as Alexander Gaaserud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winner of Tuesday&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/republicans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Republican primary&lt;/a&gt; will be the heavy favorite to win the November general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polls close at 7:30 p.m. ET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Steve Carell, John Krasinski reveal whether they will return to ‘The Office’ spinoff at premiere of &apos;IF’</title>
                    
                    <description>Michael Scott and John Krasinski reveal whether they will appear in &amp;quot;The Office&amp;quot; spinoff as their original characters Michael and Jim at the premiere of &amp;quot;IF.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A spinoff of the popular television series &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/sitcom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;The Office&quot;&lt;/a&gt; was recently announced, causing fans to speculate whether any original cast members will make an appearance on the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a recent interview on the red carpet at the movie premiere of &quot;IF,&quot; Steve Carell, who played the beloved Michael Scott, and John Krasinski, who appeared as Jim Halpert, set the record straight on if fans should expect a cameo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The verdict?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/most-anticipated-movies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘IF’, ‘THE KARATE KID’, ‘DEADPOOL 3’ AND OTHER HIGHLY ANTICIPATED FILMS OF 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I will be watching, but I will not be showing up. It’s just a new thing and there’s really no reason for my character [Michael Scott] to show up in something like that,&quot; Carell told The Hollywood Reporter on Monday. &quot;But I’m excited about it, it sounds like a great conceit. I love the idea — I guess it’s set in a failing newspaper company, and I worked with Domhnall Gleeson, who is one of the leads; I did [2022 series] ‘The Patient’ with him, and he’s an excellent actor and a super nice guy, so I think it’ll be great.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krasinski was not as direct with his answer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As of now, I haven&apos;t been asked,&quot; Krasinski shared with ET on the &quot;IF&quot; premiere red carpet. &quot;But the truth is I&apos;d do anything for Greg Daniels, it sounds like they have a really fun idea.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m actually working with Domhnall Gleeson right now in Guy Ritchie&apos;s movie,&quot; Krasinski told the outlet. &quot;He&apos;s so good, and he&apos;s so sweet - he&apos;s going to crush in the show.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/john-krasinski-other-cast-members-office-received-ivy-league-education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOHN KRASINSKI AND OTHER CAST MEMBERS OF ‘THE OFFICE’ WHO RECEIVED AN IVY LEAGUE EDUCATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spinoff, set in the same universe as Dunder Mifflin, is co-created by Greg Daniels, who also co-created &quot;The Office&quot; and Michael Koman, co-creator of the series &quot;Nathan for You.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Gleeson, Sabrina Impacciatore, who is widely known for her role in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;season two of &quot;The White Lotus,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; is also set to star in the spinoff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While an &quot;Office&quot; reunion with original castmembers does not seem to be in the cards for the spinoff, Krasinski and Carell did have a reunion of their own for the new movie &quot;IF.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movie, hitting theaters on May 17, was directed by Krasinski. Carell stars in the film as the voice of Blue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He directed some episodes of&lt;i&gt; &apos;&lt;/i&gt;The Office’ so I was familiar with him as a director, and he’s a great director — he’s very thorough, he’s smart, and he knows how to work with actors because he is one,&quot; Carell told The Hollywood Reporter. &quot;It was just a joy from beginning to end and I jumped at the chance to work with him again, partly just to be with him. He’s a good friend and I hadn’t seem him in a while, so it was nice to catch up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film stars a number of A-list celebs who have lent their voices to the many imaginary friend characters in the movie, including Kraskinski&apos;s wife, Emily Blunt, Blake Lively, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Matt Damon and Awkwafina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ryan Reynolds also stars in &quot;IF,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; alongside Cailey Fleming. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A bus carrying nearly dozens of farmworkers crashed in Florida on Tuesday morning, leaving eight dead and 38 others injured, according to authorities.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A bus carrying farmworkers was involved in a crash &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Florida&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday morning, leaving at least eight people dead and 38 others hospitalized, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2010 International Bus was carrying nearly 50 workers around 6:30 a.m. when the vehicle collided with a 2001 Ford Ranger pickup truck in &quot;a sideswiped manner&quot; on West State Road 40 in Marion County, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Florida Highway Patrol&lt;/a&gt; (FHP) said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear what caused the two vehicles to collide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the collision, the bus careened off the road and plowed through a fence before overturning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-teen-water-skier-killed-hit-run-boat-crash&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLORIDA BALLERINA, 15, KILLED IN HIT-AND-RUN BOAT CRASH IN WATER-SKIING ACCIDENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of those hospitalized, eight people were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;critically injured&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;, while 30 others were treated for non-life-threatening injuries. The driver of the pickup was also hospitalized with serious injuries, officials said.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods confirmed during a news conference that the bus was carrying migrant workers, which he said was common in the agricultural county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bus was taking the workers to Cannon Farms in Dunnellon when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/transportation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;fatal crash&lt;/a&gt; occurred, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/3-killed-3-injured-california-speeding-tesla-flies-power-pole-knocks-out-power&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 KILLED, 3 INJURED IN CALIFORNIA AFTER SPEEDING TESLA FLIES INTO POWER POLE AND BUILDING, KNOCKS OUT POWER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Marion County Sheriff’s Office said West Highway 40 was closed due to a &quot;severe accident with fatalities,&quot; and advised drivers to take an alternate route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FHP is leading the investigation. FHP Lt. Pat Riordan said the investigation would be &quot;lengthy,&quot; with no conclusion expected for at least six months.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A family is praying for a miracle after 10-year-old Asher Sullivan was swept into a storm drain after a severe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxweather.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;weather event.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Sullivan said on Facebook that his son was playing outside while neighbors fixed their homes and cleaned debris after a storm tore through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Christiana, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, where, &quot;Somehow, Asher got caught in the storm drain and was swept under the neighborhood streets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He eventually came out in a drainage ditch and CPR was administered for quite some time,&quot; Jimmy Sullivan wrote on Facebook. &quot;His heart beat was reestablished, but the damage is substantial.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Sullivan, superintendent/director of schools with the Rutherford County School District, has been posting regular updates, and his family are holding on to the slightest glimpses of promise, but he said Sunday, &quot;recovery does not seem possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-mom-dies-saving-drowning-daughter-just-before-mothers-day-sheriff&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MOM DIES SAVING DROWNING DAUGHTER JUST BEFORE MOTHER&apos;S DAY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sullivan wrote on Friday that the doctor told his family Asher &quot;wouldn&apos;t survive his injuries,&quot; but neurology &quot;saw a few signs,&quot; such as a pain response in his arm and pupils reacting to light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later the same day, Sullivan said his son breathed on his own for the second time while on a ventilator. &quot;Only a few, but a win is a win.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Think we need to leave him alone for the night to rest,&quot; he wrote in a 6:30 p.m. post on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/americans-stranded-norwegian-cruise-save-elderly-passenger-family-says-ship-left-her-die&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;AMERICANS, INCLUDING SOUTH CAROLINA COUPLE, STRANDED BY  CRUISE SAVE ELDERLY PASSENGER, FAMILY SAYS: SHIP ‘LEFT HER TO DIE’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the faintest hint of hope dimmed even more. &quot;Neurological signs we were seeing as positives have stopped,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;(Asher) had some real tough moments with pulse, blood pressure and breathing,&quot; Sullivan wrote on Facebook Sunday shortly after 6 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same Sunday evening update, Sullivan posted a picture of his family holding hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/search-missing-south-carolina-cruise-passenger-complicated-jungle-terrain-family-demands-us-help&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;VOLUNTEERS&apos; SEARCH FOR MISSING DAD WHO DISAPPEARED DURING CRUISE EXCURSION COMPLICATED BY JUNGLE TERRAIN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unfortunately, the worst case scenarios seemed to have come true,&quot; the father wrote in a heartbreaking post. &quot;He’s not in imminent danger at this very moment, but recovery does not seem possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he and his wife Kaycee &quot;have some impossible decisions to make in the next few days that no parents should have to face. Please pray for our family and our sweet Asher.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nurses woke up Asher&apos;s parents to say he stopped breathing on his own, and his eyes were not responsive, according to a Monday Facebook post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/nurse-helping-americans-alleged-bahamas-attack-scared-what-she-saw-couldve-been-daughters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NURSE HELPING AMERICANS IN ALLEGED BAHAMAS ATTACK WAS ‘SCARED’ BY WHAT SHE SAW: ‘COULD’VE BEEN MY DAUGHTERS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday night was much the same, Sullivan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asher&apos;s tragic accident happened after his hometown in middle Tennessee was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/tornado&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;devastated by tornadoes&lt;/a&gt;, severe storms and floods on May 8 and 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Several waves of severe thunderstorms, including many supercells, impacted the midstate during this period,&quot; the National Weather Service said. &quot;All together, this event resulted in widespread wind damage across nearly every county of Middle Tennessee, large hail up to apple size and at least four tornadoes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 500 people gathered for a prayer vigil on Thursday, after news about Asher&apos;s tragic accident spread through the community, according to the school district. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school district posted over a dozen photos of community members and friends holding signs with Asher&apos;s picture saying, &quot;Prayers for Asher,&quot; on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They prayed, held each other and reflected, as they support the Sullivan family as strongly as Asher is fighting for his life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thank you to the 500-plus community members who attended Thursday&apos;s prayer vigil for RCS Director of Schools Dr. Jimmy Sullivan and his family as Asher Sullivan continues to fight for his life,&quot; the school district wrote in its Facebook post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Please keep the family and Asher&apos;s care team in your thoughts and prayers in the days ahead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Washington governor&apos;s race loses two Bob Fergusons after Attorney General Bob Ferguson issues legal threats</title>
                    
                    <description>A conservative activist took credit for recruiting two men with the same name as Democratic frontrunner Bob Ferguson to enter Washington&amp;apos;s gubernatorial race.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson briefly had two unexpected challengers in the state&apos;s gubernatorial primary: Bob Ferguson and Bob Ferguson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by Monday evening, both of the lesser-known Bob Fergusons had withdrawn from the race, fearing prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The saga began on Friday when both rival Bobs entered the governor&apos;s race as Democrats, just before the filing deadline. They joined an already crowded field — 30 people filed to run for governor last week in Washington, according to the Secretary of State&apos;s website. The filing fee costs nearly $2,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/washington&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; has an open primary on Aug. 6. The top two candidates advance to the general election, regardless of their party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/west-coast-exodus-drives-surprising-political-effect-red-state-not-liberal-shift&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WEST COAST EXODUS DRIVES SURPRISING POLITICAL EFFECT IN RED STATE, AND IT&apos;S NOT A LIBERAL SHIFT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative activist Glen Morgan took credit for recruiting the same-named candidates and wrote on Facebook that the two Bobs are &quot;superior in every way to the AG running for the same office, and I believe they can provide better choices for the Democrats in our state for that office.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other Bobs are a retired state employee from Yakima and a military veteran from Graham, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/three-bob-night-two-more-bob-fergusons-running-for-wa-governor/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If I had started a little bit earlier, I would have been able to have six Bob Fergusons,&quot; Morgan said, according to the Times. &quot;I contacted about 12. I just ran out of time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferguson — the one who is currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/blue-state-high-capacity-magazine-ban-unconstitutional-judge-rules-law-remains-books-now&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;attorney general&lt;/a&gt; — was unamused, writing Saturday that the intent is clearly to &quot;confuse voters and diminish votes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a direct attack on our democracy and the integrity of the Washington state election system that could lead to the victory of an anti-choice conservative like Dave Reichert,&quot; he wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a press conference Monday, the attorney general warned that the other Bobs could face criminal charges if they didn&apos;t drop out of the race by the 5 p.m. withdrawal deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a felony under &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=29A.84.320&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Washington law&lt;/a&gt; for someone to file for office with a last name &quot;similar to one who has already filed for the same office, and whose political reputation is widely known, with intent to confuse and mislead the electors by capitalizing on the public reputation of the candidate who had previously filed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/seattle-area-officials-want-no-locks-no-cells-juvenile-offenders-amid-rise-teen-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEATTLE-AREA OFFICIALS WANT &apos;NO LOCKS, NO CELLS&apos; FOR JUVENILE OFFENDERS AMID RISE IN TEEN CRIME&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I suspect they did not know about the legal implications of their actions,&quot; Ferguson said, adding that cease-and-desist letters were left at the other Bobs homes on Sunday and that he hoped they would recognize the seriousness of the situation and drop out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they don&apos;t, the attorney general said, &quot;We will have no choice but to take more serious steps and ask local prosecutors to do the right thing and pursue further action.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Monday evening, both Bobs were out of the race. The Bob Ferguson from Graham &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neighborsforbobfergusonpac.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;shared a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying that he was withdrawing &quot;under duress.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was publicly labeled a ‘threat to democracy’ by another candidate and his supporters,&quot; he wrote. &quot;In a typical hypocritical fashion, this other candidate’s actions are the true threat to democracy. I believe this shows that the other candidate fears he has not effectively done enough to stand out, or that he thinks voters are not competent enough to think for themselves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Ferguson celebrated the win Monday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We defeated their dirty tricks,&quot; he wrote. &quot;You won’t have to worry about which ‘Bob Ferguson’ to vote for. This blatant attack on election integrity failed, and democracy wins.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/focus-merit-oregon-county-axes-diversity-office-cost-nearly-1-million-year&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘FOCUS ON MERIT’: OREGON COUNTY AXES DIVERSITY OFFICE THAT COST NEARLY $1 MILLION A YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the press conference, Ferguson did not specifically say whether Morgan himself could face charges for orchestrating the &quot;scheme.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will cross that bridge when we get to it,&quot; Ferguson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan did not address the possibility of civil or criminal penalties when asked for comment via email, but wrote that the attorney general &quot;has always been angry and upset&quot; with him for filing a campaign finance &lt;a href=&quot;https://crosscut.com/politics/2023/07/washington-governors-race-sparks-stricter-campaign-finance-rule&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;complaint against Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoever wins the governor&apos;s race will replace &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gov-jay-inslee-wont-seek-reelection-ending-speculation-unprecedented-4th-term&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Democrat Jay Inslee&lt;/a&gt;, who has led the state since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republican side of the race has been mired in drama as well. Last month, both leading candidates were initially disqualified from receiving the state&apos;s GOP endorsement, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theolympian.com/news/local/article287872330.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;The Olympian&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semi Bird, a former school board member, was disqualified for his failure to disclose a misdemeanor grand larceny charge from 1993. Dave Reichert, a former congressman and detective credited with nabbing the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/ted-bundy-green-river-killer-gary-ridgway-true-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Green River killer,&lt;/a&gt; was disqualified as a result of a &quot;disparity in the vetting of the governor candidates,&quot; the outlet reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delegates overruled the disqualification and 72% endorsed Bird, who has raised only $400,000 compared to Reichert&apos;s $2.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Trump allies join forces to hammer &apos;sham&apos; trial &apos;weaponized&apos; against 45th president: &apos;Political persecution&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Former President Trump&amp;apos;s allies, including Vivek Ramaswamy, joined him in court Tuesday, where they held a press conference outside railing against the &amp;quot;sham&amp;quot; trial.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Allies of former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;, including former 2024 presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy and Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, slammed the ongoing NY v. Trump trial as a &quot;sham&quot; promoted by Democrats ahead of the 2024 election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I learned a lot from being in there in person. It is one of the most depressing places I have been in my life. But it is fitting because the only thing more depressing than the environment of that courtroom is what&apos;s actually happening in there. It&apos;s straight out of a Kafka novel. The prosecution&apos;s main strategy appears to be to bore the jurors into submission. And if you look in that direction, sadly, it may appear to actually be working,&quot; Ramaswamy said Tuesday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;outside the New York courthouse,&lt;/a&gt; adding that the case is &quot;politicized persecution.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The whole case that Alvin Bragg has brought depends on one premise for them to charge this as a felony, is that Donald Trump somehow should have used campaign funds to make an allegedly personal payment. Yet if he had done that, their case against him would be even stronger. This is garbage.… It&apos;s damned if you do, damned if you don&apos;t. This is a sham. This is not the United States of America. This is some third-rate banana republic,&quot; Ramaswamy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida Rep. Cory Mills, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Ramaswamy, Donalds and House Speaker Mike Johnson joined Trump in court on Tuesday. A Trump campaign official told Fox News Digital that the supporters all volunteered to join Trump in court to support their friend, and were not invited by the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/may-14-trump-trial-new-york-michael-cohen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIVE UPDATES: MICHAEL COHEN TESTIMONY CONTINUES AFTER EX-LAWYER REVEALS SECRET RECORDINGS OF TRUMP IN NY TRIAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&apos;s nothing that has been wrong here. Nothing that has been done poorly by President Trump. The only thing that&apos;s being done wrong is by this judge. His daughter is making money, raising money for Democrats, and all of the fundraising emails, and all the fundraising things are about this trial that his daughter is using. He won&apos;t recuse himself. This is a travesty of justice. This is a misuse of the justice system,&quot; Donalds said during the press conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s legal team had previously demanded presiding Judge Juan Merchan&apos;s recusal from the case, citing that Merchan&apos;s daughter works as a Democratic consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trial-veepstakes-trump-allies-show-force-ahead-michael-cohens-second-day-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP TRIAL VEEPSTAKES? TRUMP ALLIES SHOW UP IN FORCE AHEAD OF MICHAEL COHEN&apos;S SECOND DAY OF TESTIMONY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mills slammed the trial as &quot;the weaponization of what was the Department of Justice,&quot; and Burgum called the case &quot;election interference&quot; that is &quot;tying up the president for being out on the campaign trail.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The allies joining Trump Tuesday follow fellow supporters such as Ohio Sen. JD Vance, New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, and Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville who attended Trump&apos;s trial on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump is in court for his 17th day of the trial on Tuesday. The case focuses on Cohen paying former pornographic performer Stormy Daniels $130,000 to allegedly quiet her claims of an alleged 2006 extramarital affair with the then-real estate tycoon. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege that the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen and fraudulently logged the payments as legal expenses. Prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified records with the intent to commit or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conceal a second crime&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/massive-trump-beach-rally-deep-blue-nj-draws-stark-contrast-bidens-beach-weekend-biden-could-never&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MASSIVE TRUMP BEACH RALLY IN DEEP-BLUE NJ DRAWS STARK CONTRAST TO BIDEN&apos;S BEACH WEEKEND: &apos;BIDEN COULD NEVER&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has pleaded not guilty in the case and has maintained his innocence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week began with testimony from Cohen, who is considered the prosecution&apos;s star witness in the case. The former Trump attorney detailed to the court that he spent his own funds to pay Daniels $130,000 in order to execute a non-disclosure agreement and obtain rights to her claims of an affair. In October 2016, according to Cohen&apos;s testimony, he told Trump that Daniels must be paid in order to quiet her claims &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ahead of Election Day the following month&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cohen&apos;s testimony also included&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; how he secretly recorded Trump in 2016 regarding another payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal. McDougal also claimed she had an affair with Trump in 2006, which the 45th president has repeatedly denied. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker purchased exclusive rights to her story to bury the claims ahead of the 2016 election, according to trial testimony. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-highly-conflicted-judge-after-first-day-michael-cohens-testimony-wraps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP BLASTS &apos;HIGHLY CONFLICTED&apos; JUDGE AFTER MICHAEL COHEN&apos;S FIRST DAY OF TESTIMONY WRAPS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Cohen&apos;s testimony comes&lt;/a&gt; after Daniels took the stand last week, and detailed to the court that she met Trump in 2006 at Lake Tahoe in Nevada during a celebrity golf tournament. She alleged that the pair had sex in Trump&apos;s hotel room during the event, which Trump has repeatedly denied in public comments. Daniels&apos; testimony also included describing to the court how she got into the pornography business after working as an exotic dancer as a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal experts subsequently sounded off that Daniels’ testimony was irrelevant to the case and that it should not have been admitted into the record. Trump&apos;s legal team twice moved for a mistrial, but was denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michael-cohen-testifies-he-secretly-recorded-trump-lead-up-2016-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL COHEN TESTIFIES HE SECRETLY RECORDED TRUMP IN LEAD-UP TO 2016 ELECTION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burgum added during the Tuesday press conference that while the trial continues, allies of Trump&apos;s will continue campaigning for the 45th president as Americans deal with spiraling inflation under the Biden administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re all here today because of the circus of this trial. But I want to say a word to those Americans out there that are dealing with Biden&apos;s inflation. And when their paychecks aren&apos;t helping them get through the end of the month because they&apos;re paying more for their gas and their food. They&apos;re paying more for their electricity. I want them to know that while this trial is going on, there&apos;s many of us around the country that are out helping campaign for President Trump to make sure that the message gets through,&quot; Burgum said in closing remarks. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>&apos;Yellowstone&apos; star Kevin Costner ‘took a beating’ after show&apos;s implosion, explains ‘real truth&apos; behind delay</title>
                    
                    <description>Kevin Costner shared the &amp;quot;real truth&amp;quot; about the behind-the-scenes drama on the &amp;quot;Yellowstone&amp;quot; set and what led to the show&amp;apos;s delay.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For over a year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kevin-costner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kevin Costner&lt;/a&gt; has been at the center of controversy when it comes to the future of &quot;Yellowstone.&quot; Now, the actor is sharing the &quot;real truth&quot; about the behind-the-scenes drama and what led to the show&apos;s delay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new interview &lt;a href=&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/05/kevin-costner-horizon-an-american-saga-yellowstone-controversy-1235907679/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;with Deadline&lt;/a&gt;, the 69-year-old actor, who portrays John Dutton lll in the series, says he &quot;lived up&quot; to his contract despite ongoing speculation and opened up about the series of events that led to the show&apos;s demise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was no script,&quot; Costner, who has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kevin-costners-yellowstone-co-star-luke-grimes-speaks-out-stars-unfortunate-exit-hit-show&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;yet to film&lt;/a&gt; the second half of season 5 (5B), revealed. &quot;And then things imploded. You’ve been reading one version [of the show&apos;s issues] for a year and a half.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the first half of the fifth season aired late last year, the show took a break for the holidays. They were set to return to filming at the top of the new year, but that was pushed back to sometime this summer. A premiere date has not been announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/yellowstone-ending-after-second-half-season-five-amid-kevin-costner-drama&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&apos;YELLOWSTONE&apos; ENDING AFTER SECOND HALF OF SEASON FIVE AMID KEVIN COSTNER DRAMA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple sources kept alleging that Costner only wanted to work for one week to film the rest of the episodes, which would be difficult to do as he is the star of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I left my movie [&quot;Horizon&quot;] to be on time for them for 5B,&quot; Costner said. &quot;I left exactly when they wanted, and it made it hard on me. It turns out they didn’t have the scripts for 5B. They needed four more days just to complete the first eight episodes. I left early to give them what they needed to have a complete eight, and I felt bad that the audience didn’t get 10. They didn’t have the scripts for anything else.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, &quot;So, what you read in the end was that I said, ‘Well, look, I’m doing my movie. If you want me to work a week because you want to kill me or whatever else, I can give you a week.’ I really didn’t have that week to give them, but I said, I’ll do that. And then they [spun that] into, I only wanted to work a week.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you think that’s who I am?,&quot; he continued. &quot;I’ve never missed a day of work. I’ve never left before fulfilling my contractual obligations. A lot of times, I stay as much as I can.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for Costner did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital&apos;s request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costner, who has faced plenty of criticism over the future of the show, admitted he was &quot;bothered&quot; by the production&apos;s lack of support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They were silent and that bothered me in the world of how you do things,&quot; he confessed. &quot;Why don’t you stick up for me? I went and sold this thing for you. I was going to only do one season. I made it for three. I fulfilled three. So, I went from one to three, then I did a fourth one for them, and they wanted to do three more. So, I made the contract to do that. They imploded. I had a contract to do five, six and seven. I was contracted to do that. There’s nothing I could have done to get out of that, nor was I trying to just figure out how, when we started.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[Production] didn’t have the scripts. And they wrote these other three shows,&quot; he added, referencing the various &quot;Yellowstone&quot; spinoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They don’t ever talk about that. And all they did was remember we were releasing the series in June, then it moved to October. They covered by changing their release pattern. That time was about a 14-month period. I said, ‘I can’t ever go through that again, where you shut down for over a year and I don’t have something in line to do.’ All I did was protect myself, but I didn’t put myself in first position, over ‘Yellowstone.’ I filled the gaps. Do you see that?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the ongoing drama, Costner - whose four-part post-Civil War drama &quot;Horizon&quot; premiered at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/cannes-film-festival&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cannes Film Festival&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in May - said he is &quot;open&quot; to coming back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m very open to coming back. If they’ve got so many other things going on, maybe this circles back and it’s a really cool two seasons,&quot; he said. &quot;Or end it, if the writing’s there and I’m happy with it. I’m open to that. But I took a beating over these guys not speaking up for me and allowing crazy stories to come out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m not happy about that,&quot; he admitted. &quot;But if the writing is there, I will be there too. They had first position. I didn’t do &apos;Horizon&apos; because I was tired of doing ‘Yellowstone.’ That’s a bulls--- story. I didn’t do ‘Horizon’ to compete with ‘Yellowstone.’ This is something I’ve had a long time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etonline.com/kevin-costner-discusses-son-hayes-acting-debut-in-horizon-and-final-season-of-yellowstone-exclusive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;interview with Entertainment Tonight&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at CinemaCon in April, Costner said he has already envisioned how his character&apos;s story line will end — but is not sure creator Taylor Sheridan will go in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, you know, he needs to be proactive in what happens,&quot; Costner told ET of his character. &quot;And I&apos;ve kind of had my own fantasy how it might be, but that&apos;s Taylor&apos;s thing. I said as much to him, you know, a while back. Maybe he doesn&apos;t remember. I had thoughts how it could happen, but we just have to see.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think that they should do whatever they want to do,&quot; he told Deadline. &quot;Am I open to coming back? I’ve never been in a position to tell them what to do. I can only do what I can do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Emily Trainham contributed to this post. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>An Instacart driver in Georgia took to TikTok after failing to deliver wings to a state prison. The request on the app said the delivery was for a &amp;quot;death row inmate feast.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A delivery driver is attracting attention online after she claimed in a TikTok video that a food order she picked up was requested to be delivered to a prison for a death row inmate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrishalea Farley, 39, a part-time Instacart driver from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/georgia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;McDonough, Georgia,&lt;/a&gt; told Fox News Digital that she received a request for a large wing platter and potato wedges from a local Publix to be picked up and delivered to a location nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without thinking much about it, Farley said, she took the order and headed to the recipient&apos;s address. She then realized she was driving to Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison in Jackson, where male death row inmates are housed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/steak-jelly-please-americans-tell-uber-eats-odd-popular-customer-requests-2023&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘STEAK AND JELLY, PLEASE,’ AMERICANS TELL UBER EATS — AND OTHER ODD AND POPULAR CUSTOMER REQUESTS OF 2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was directed to &quot;See chaplain Miller for death row inmate…&quot; – according to the Instacart order notes that showed on her app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My initial reaction after reading the delivery information [was] I thought I was actually delivering a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/odd-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;last meal to an inmate,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Farley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farley said that when she arrived at the prison, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a correctional officer&lt;/a&gt; asked her to pull her car forward so that her delivery attempt could be reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/accomplished-drivers-spotlighted-uber-first-ever-yearbook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MOST ACCOMPLISHED DRIVERS SPOTLIGHTED BY UBER IN FIRST-EVER ‘YEARBOOK’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I read it off and gave them the name, and I told them the person that they told me to contact, which was Chaplain Miller,&quot; Farley told Fox News Digital in a statement sent via text message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/man-goes-viral-taste-testing-last-meals-notorious-death-row-inmates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAN GOES VIRAL FOR TASTE-TESTING LAST MEALS OF NOTORIOUS DEATH ROW INMATES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Once they [saw] it, they just told me that they [couldn’t] receive that particular order,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farley said she was advised to give the food away or donate it, since officers would not accept the order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The wings were kept, and me and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/family-and-friends&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;my kids&lt;/a&gt; enjoyed a nice meal that evening,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farley recorded herself explaining the incident and posted the video onto TikTok, where it garnered more than 590,000 views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The food order totaled $15.66 and Farley received a tip of $3.23, according to screenshots of Farley&apos;s shopper &quot;batch summary,&quot; which she shared with Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dropoff occurred on April 10 at 1:13 p.m., and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the distance&lt;/a&gt; from Publix to the prison was 38.4 miles, another screenshot of the order showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to Instacart for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farley said the bizarre moment ignited a mix of emotions – from her thinking that she was delivering someone’s final meal, to confusion about whether an inmate had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ordered food&lt;/a&gt; himself through Instacart from a mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Never am I laughing at the [inmate&apos;s] situation, as I wish that on no one, but the humor of it all just kept me laughing,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>House Speaker Mike Johnson and Ohio Sen. JD Vance are among the bevy of Republican lawmakers and politicians joining President Trump amid the NY v. Trump trial.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A bevy of Republican allies are joining &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;former President Trump&lt;/a&gt; in Manhattan court this week, including a handful of politicians floated as potential vice presidential contenders in Trump&apos;s effort to re-win the White House this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump was flanked Tuesday ahead of court by House Speaker Mike Johnson, Florida Reps. Byron Donalds and Cory Mills, as well as North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former 2024 presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson held a press conference Tuesday morning outside the courthouse, where he railed against presiding Judge Juan Merchan and the prosecution team as politically-motivated against Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What we&apos;ve got here is a partisan Democrat district attorney. We have a Biden donor judge, and we have an assistant D.A. who was recently a top official at the Department of Justice, Biden&apos;s DOJ, and recently received over $10,000 in payments from the Democratic National Committee,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/may-14-trump-trial-new-york-michael-cohen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIVE UPDATES: MICHAEL COHEN TESTIMONY TO CONTINUE AFTER EX-LAWYER REVEALS SECRET RECORDINGS OF TRUMP IN NY TRIAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The judicial system in our country has been weaponized against President Trump. The system is using all the tools at its disposal right now to punish one president and provide cover for another. And meanwhile, among the atrocities here, the judge&apos;s own daughter is making millions of dollars doing online fundraising for Democrat,&quot; he continued, citing Merchan&apos;s daughter&apos;s work as a political consultant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the former president was joined by Ohio Sen. JD Vance, New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, and his son Eric Trump. Eric Trump is also in court with his father again Tuesday, as is Trump attorney Alina Habba. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trial-veepstakes-trump-allies-show-force-ahead-michael-cohens-second-day-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP TRIAL VEEPSTAKES? TRUMP ALLIES SHOW UP IN FORCE AHEAD OF MICHAEL COHEN&apos;S SECOND DAY OF TESTIMONY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians and lawmakers such as Vance, Donalds, Burgum and Ramaswamy have all been floated as potential picks for vice president on Trump&apos;s ticket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Trump campaign official told Fox News Digital that the supporters all volunteered to join Trump in court to support their friend, and were not invited by the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump is back in court Tuesday for his 17th day of the trial, where the court is hearing testimony again from former Trump attorney Michael Cohen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/massive-trump-beach-rally-deep-blue-nj-draws-stark-contrast-bidens-beach-weekend-biden-could-never&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MASSIVE TRUMP BEACH RALLY IN DEEP-BLUE NJ DRAWS STARK CONTRAST TO BIDEN&apos;S BEACH WEEKEND: &apos;BIDEN COULD NEVER&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;action-packed day in court&lt;/a&gt;, hearing testimony for the first time from former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen. The case focuses on Cohen paying former pornographic actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to allegedly quiet her claims of an alleged extramarital affair with the then-real estate tycoon in 2006. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-allies-pour-into-nyc-courthouse-support-their-friend-not-coordinating-campaign&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP ALLIES POUR INTO NYC COURTHOUSE TO &apos;SUPPORT THEIR FRIEND,&apos; SAY THEY&apos;RE NOT COORDINATING WITH CAMPAIGN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege that the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen and fraudulently logged the payments as legal expenses. Prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified records with the intent to commit or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conceal a second crime&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen testified to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;secretly recording&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Trump in September 2016 to share with publisher David Pecker proof that Trump planned to reimburse Pecker for purchasing the potentially damaging story, according to the testimony. Cohen added that in addition to easing Pecker&apos;s mind that he would be repaid, he also made the recording in order to keep Pecker &quot;loyal&quot; to Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-highly-conflicted-judge-after-first-day-michael-cohens-testimony-wraps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP BLASTS &apos;HIGHLY CONFLICTED&apos; JUDGE AFTER MICHAEL COHEN&apos;S FIRST DAY OF TESTIMONY WRAPS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also detailed to the court that he spent his own funds to pay Daniels $130,000 in order to execute a non-disclosure agreement and obtain rights to her claims of the affair. In October 2016, according to Cohen&apos;s testimony, he told Trump that Daniels must be paid in order to quiet her claims &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ahead of Election Day the following month&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He testified that he spoke with Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg about how to fund the payment, with Weisselberg saying he was not in a position to initially foot the bill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michael-cohen-testifies-he-secretly-recorded-trump-lead-up-2016-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL COHEN TESTIFIES HE SECRETLY RECORDED TRUMP IN LEAD-UP TO 2016 ELECTION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-defenders-show-up-force-ahead-cohen-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP, DEFENDERS SHOW UP IN FORCE AHEAD OF COHEN TESTIMONY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen said he did not discuss the matter with his wife, and decided to gather funds through a home equity line of credit instead of drawing the money from his personal account. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The star witness here is Michael Cohen. I just listened to a few moments of his, testimony this morning, and it is consistent with what he&apos;s already done. This is a man who is clearly on a mission for personal revenge, and who is widely known as a witness who has trouble with the truth. He is someone who has a history of perjury and is well known for it. No one should believe a word he says today. He lied to Congress. He lied to the IRS. He lied to federal election officials. Even Cohen&apos;s own lawyer testified to a grand jury that he is not reliable. So there&apos;s nothing that he presents here that should be given any weight at all by a jury, and certainly not this judge,&quot; Speaker Johnson said in his remarks Monday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;outside the Manhattan courthouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
