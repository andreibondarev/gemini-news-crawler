This is where privacy has been victimized.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In this young victim’s life, will they ever trust what’s in their bedroom again because of a simple camera that was plugged in with the sole intention of securing footage of a young victim in their bedroom doing what all of us do in our bedroom, where we think we’re safe.&quot; Swanson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee&apos;s secret camera invention was discovered by the child&apos;s parents and taken immediately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to the police&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were able to find Lee and arrest him,&quot; police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/pilot-accused-plane-stalk-woman-4-years-claims-never-met&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PILOT SUSPECTED OF USING PLANE TO STALK WOMAN FOR 4 YEARS SAY THEY&apos;VE NEVER MET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 30-year-old man&apos;s iPhone contained hundreds of graphic images of the girl in the privacy of her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This phone is the creepy white van of the 21st century,&quot; Swanson said. &quot;This right here is what holds child pornography around the world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee was charged with using a computer to commit a crime and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/sex-crimes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;accosting a child&lt;/a&gt; for immoral purposes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is also facing 30 counts of child pornography for what police found on his phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee is being held on $600,000 cash bond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news of the hidden camera inside the Michigan girl&apos;s bedroom came after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a Florida boy&lt;/a&gt; was found being tracked by an Apple Airtag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackie Giurleo realized her son was being tracked through the device, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/mom-unravels-mystery-when-unknown-air-tag-ends-up-tracking-her-son&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fox 35 reported.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giurleo told the outlet that she did not own any AirTags when she began getting iPhone alerts that one of the devices was nearby at a Christmas parade on Satellite Beach. A map of all the places her son had been popped up on her phone as an undetected AirTag alert, she told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She searched through all of her son&apos;s clothing and toys, and said her &quot;heart dropped&quot; when she found the device in a quarter-sized hole bored into her son&apos;s shoe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said it had been tracking him for nearly a month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Luckily, it just turned into a happy coincidence of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/parenting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;tale of two moms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; Giurleo told Fox 35. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>New York City health officials are warning residents about an increase in transmitted bacterial illness spread by rat urine.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York City health officials&lt;/a&gt; issued a warning about the increase in transmitted bacterial illness spread by rat urine after 24 cases were reported in 2023, the most for any year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only six cases of leptospirosis have been reported in the city so far this year, but numbers were trending upward, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York City Department of Health said.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases in New York are largely associated with exposure to materials contaminated with rat urine from the Norway rat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease can cause fever, headache, chills, muscle aches, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, conjunctival suffusion, jaundice, and rash, Celia Quinn, the deputy commissioner for the Division of Disease Control, who issued an April 12 memo warning of the disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nyc-mayor-blames-part-rat-infestation-why-people-leaving-big-apple&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NYC MAYOR BLAMES, IN PART, RAT INFESTATION ON WHY PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE BIG APPLE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not treated, kidney failure, meningitis, liver damage, and respiratory distress can occur, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Transmission occurs through direct contact with infectious urine or urine contaminated water, soil, or food, entering the body through open wounds or mucous membranes,&quot; the memo states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2001 to 2023, the Bronx had the most cases with 37, while Manhattan had 28, the memo said. Six deaths were reported in the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person-to-person transmission is rare, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Leptospira bacteria can die within minutes in the dry heat and freezing cold, Quinn said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The cold winters of NYC likely limit the extent to which leptospires can survive in the environment,&quot; she said. &quot;However, excessive rain and unseasonably warm temperatures, factors associated with climate change, may support the persistence of leptospires in more temperate areas like NYC.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-city-hiring-new-rat-czar-help-citys-long-running-battle-against-rodents&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NEW YORK CITY HIRING NEW ‘RAT CZAR’ TO HELP WITH CITY&apos;S LONG-RUNNING BATTLE AGAINST RODENTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half of the 24 cases reported last year were reported between June and October, a period when there was a warmer and wetter climate with excessive rain and &quot;unseasonably&quot; warm days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of cases raised alarms because only three per year were reported from 2001 to 2020. From 2021 to 2023, the city received 15 reports of leptospirosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 3 million rats call New York City home, according to a study by a pest company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Mayor Eric Adams said rat infestation was partly responsible for many New Yorkers leaving the city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some people who have children and families decide they want to go to a place where their children can play outdoors, larger green spaces, you want to see animals — you don’t see animals except for rats in New York,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/985-23/transcript-mayor-adams-continues-get-stuff-done-working-class-new-yorkers-halfway-through&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adams said when&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; asked about the plunging population data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So there’s a combination of things,&quot; he added. &quot;And we are getting rid of those rats, by the way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>The parents of a woman gunned down by her ex-father-in-law in the Las Vegas law firm shooting said a family court judge ignored warning signs.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The family of the woman gunned down last week alongside her prominent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/las-vegas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; attorney husband by her ex-father-in-law is shedding new light on the tragedy, saying the situation could have been avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Despite a slow-moving court battle for protection, and one that ultimately failed her, Ashley lived in constant fear for her safety and that of her children,&quot; Paul and Julie Page, the parents of Ashley Prince, said in a statement released earlier this week. &quot;She battled relentlessly and, unfortunately, all our fears became our reality.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prince, 30, was being represented by her new husband, Dennis Prince, 57, during a child custody deposition at his Las Vegas law firm when shots were fired. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For the past two years, we have felt helpless and devastated as we witnessed Ashley endure verbal and mental abuse and threats at the hands of her former husband, Dylan Houston,&quot; the Page family said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/prominent-las-vegas-attorney-his-wife-gunned-down-by-fellow-attorney-terminal-cancer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROMINENT LAS VEGAS ATTORNEY, HIS WIFE GUNNED DOWN BY FELLOW ATTORNEY WHO HAD TERMINAL CANCER: SOURCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday&apos;s press conference marked the first time the Page family had spoken publicly about the April 8 shooting inside the Prince Law Firm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the morning hours of that fateful day, Joe Houston II, 77, shot and killed Ashley and Dennis during a child custody hearing before turning the gun on himself. Joe Houston, another attorney, was at the hearing representing his son, Dylan Houston, in his custody dispute with his ex-wife, Ashley Prince.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deposition &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/true-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;involved a years-long custody battle&lt;/a&gt; involving Dylan Houston and Ashley Prince’s two young children. The hearing began around 10 a.m. By 10:04 a.m., the 911 calls started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She would have never given up fighting for her children. And, now, despite her long-fought efforts, Ashley can no longer fight and protect her children,&quot; the Pages said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pages revealed Dylan subjected Ashley to relentless harassing death threats and threatening verbal abuse, including up to 70 text messages a day at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/prominent-las-vegas-attorney-wife-killed-another-attorney-law-firm-shooting-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROMINENT LAS VEGAS ATTORNEY, WIFE KILLED BY ANOTHER ATTORNEY IN LAW FIRM SHOOTING: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the text messages provided by the family included alleged messages from Dylan to Ashley saying, &quot;I’ll chisel you down to a weaker and worthless sack of bones,&quot; &quot;The kids are better off without you,&quot; &quot;They will know it one day and never want to be around you&quot; and &quot;I don’t want to see you unless you’re in a casket.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Every day, Ashley feared for her life, at times requesting security at public events, including events at her children’s school,&quot; the Page family said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, Ashley&apos;s parents said she was granted a restraining order against Dylan to protect herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As we all know now, our worst fears came to life last week when Dylan’s father, who was representing Dylan, perpetuated the most egregious domestic violence on behalf of his son by killing our daughter, Ashely, and her husband, Dennis,&quot; the family stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the shooting, a motion was filed for Ashley’s sister to have temporary custody of the two kids she shared with Dylan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/ex-wwe-wrestler-dressed-ken-from-barbie-movie-during-alleged-killing-vegas-hotel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EX-WWE WRESTLER WAS DRESSED AS &apos;KEN&apos; FROM &apos;BARBIE&apos; MOVIE DURING ALLEGED KILLING AT VEGAS HOTEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pages added that they are cooperating with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department in its investigation and are determined to secure full custody of their grandchildren to safeguard their future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Services were held Tuesday for Dennis. To honor Dennis&apos;s philanthropic legacy, the Prince family said that, in lieu of flowers, contributions could be made to The Shade Tree, which is a nonprofit that provides services &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to victims of domestic violence,&lt;/a&gt; and the Southern Nevada Association of Women Attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We cannot begin to imagine the devastating sense of loss felt by the Page and Prince families,&quot; the Houston family told FOX 5 News in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We understand their shock and anger. We, too, are shocked. None of us ever could conceive of our loving father doing something so egregiously out of character. Our hope is that, through the darkness, despair and grief, we can focus on the needs of the children. That focus extends to refraining from rebuttals and public accusations. Dylan is a dedicated father and is singularly committed to the welfare of his children. We are hopeful that Dylan and his children will be together soon, and we all can begin to heal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As recently as last week, Dylan was listed as a partner at Resnick &amp;amp; Louis’ Las Vegas offices’ website, but his name has since been removed, and a link to his bio page returned a &quot;page not found&quot; error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to Dylan Houston for comment. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Bush&apos;s hometown as the third &quot;most dangerous&quot; city in the United States after analyzing FBI data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Detroit and Baltimore were deemed more dangerous than St. Louis in the rankings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norado pointed to St. Louis&apos; high poverty rates, unemployment and lack of access to quality education and healthcare for creating an environment that reportedly &quot;fosters criminal activity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrat-pro-israel-group-looks-oust-2-squad-members-from-congress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEMOCRAT PRO-ISRAEL GROUP LOOKS TO OUST 2 ‘SQUAD’ MEMBERS FROM CONGRESS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the Democratic representative called for peace in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war – pointing towards the &quot;toll of violence&quot; overseas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bush has been one of the leading critics &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;of Israel&apos;s military actions&lt;/a&gt; in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/st-louis-jail-state-investigation-mismanagement-abuse-claims&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ST. LOUIS JAIL UNDER STATE INVESTIGATION OVER MISMANAGEMENT, ABUSE CLAIMS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the clouds of political rhetoric and the clamor of war, it is also easy to lose sight of the lives that have been shattered, the futures extinguished by violence, and the profound grief that war leaves in its wake,&quot; Bush said. &quot;We need to confront the harsh realities of war and recommit ourselves to the pursuit of peace.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are saying no to war. Stop the bloodshed. Stop the violence. Stop the trauma. Just stop,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bush said that the U.S. &quot;gravitates towards war.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You see, our country knows war. Our country understands war. Our country, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense/wars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;has experienced war&lt;/a&gt; on numerous occasions and in numerous places,&quot; she said. &quot;But seldom does our country know peace.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It might make sense that our country would gravitate toward war, but just because it makes sense, doesn&apos;t make it logical or right,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital has reached out to Rep. Bush&apos;s office for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>SEAN HANNITY: Democrats are now trying to re-elect a cognitive mess</title>
                    
                    <description>Fox News host Sean Hannity says former President Trump is gaining momentum ahead of the 2024 presidential election, despite efforts to silence him.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News host Sean Hannity calls out Democrats’ push to re-elect President Biden despite his &quot;record of failure&quot; on &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hannity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEAN HANNITY:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt; Democrats are now trying to re-elect a cognitive mess with a record of failure who can barely muster the energy to campaign and is now trying to create a phony appearance of being &quot;America First&quot; — something he outright rejected just four years ago.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/npr-whistleblower-uri-berliner-resigns-i-cannot-work-newsroom-where-disparaged&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NPR WHISTLEBLOWER URI BERLINER RESIGNS: ‘I CANNOT WORK IN A NEWSROOM WHERE I AM DISPARAGED’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trump, meanwhile, is gaining momentum. He&apos;s drawing big crowds. He is leading in the polls, and it is no surprise that a New York judge who donated to Biden — oh, that&apos;s fair — is now keeping the Trump campaign and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/former-ag-barr-rips-political-trump-hush-money-case-says-real-threat-democracy-progressive-left&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, the candidate, off the campaign trail, trapped in a courtroom. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If Democrats had their way, he&apos;d be in court for the next 201 days with a muzzle on the entire time, like the gag order New York has imposed on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/stephen-smith-calls-liberals-cowards-lawfare-against-trump-scared-cant-beat-him&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Donald J. Trump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;God help us, because this weaponized Department of Justice — it will never recover. Say &quot;bye, bye&quot; to the rule of law in America, because it will fold like a house of cards. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Accused Idaho killer Bryan Kohberger offers up alibi: Driving to see &apos;the moon and stars&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of killing four University of Idaho students, said he was out driving to take a hike and see &amp;quot;the moon and stars&amp;quot; at the time of the murders, his lawyers said.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bryan Kohberger, the man &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/true-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;accused of killing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; four University of Idaho undergrads in a home invasion stabbing, offered up an alibi via his attorneys on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kohberger, 29, claims he was out driving the night of the killings on Nov. 13, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Kohberger was out driving in the early morning hours of November 13, 2022; as he often did to hike and run and/or see the moon and stars,&quot; his lawyers said in court documents filed that outline his alibi. &quot;He drove throughout the area south of Pullman, Washington, west of Moscow, Idaho including Wawawai Park.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kohberger — a former criminology Ph.D. student at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/college&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Washington State University&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in nearby Pullman, Washington — is charged with four counts of murder and burglary after he allegedly stabbed 20-year-old Xana Kernodle, 20-year-old Ethan Chapin, 21-year-old Kaylee Goncalves and 21-year-old Madison Mogen with a KA-BAR knife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/bryan-kohberger-lawyer-alleges-public-bias-residents-called-police-after-being-contacted-juror-survey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KOHBERGER LAWYER ALLEGES PUBLIC BIAS AS RESIDENTS CALLED POLICE AFTER BEING CONTACTED IN JUROR SURVEY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was arrested in late December 2022. Kohberger offered up the alibi, but it is not clear if he has evidence to back it up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He claims to like all these outdoor activities. So does he have pics on social media or his phone or just someplace showing this?&quot; David Gelman, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;criminal defense attorney&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a former deputy district attorney, told Fox News Digital. &quot;In his apartment, did the police find outdoor gear? This will all disprove the alibi he offers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kohberger frequently drove at night during the school year, which is supported by his phone showing him in the countryside in the late night hours on multiple instances, court documents said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/idaho-judge-gives-bryan-kohberger-win-over-genetic-genealogy-battle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IDAHO JUDGE GIVES BRYAN KOHBERGER WIN OVER GENETIC GENEALOGY BATTLE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is supported by data from Mr. Kohberger’s phone showing him in the countryside late at night and/or in the early morning on several occasions,&quot; the documents state. &quot;The phone data includes numerous photographs taken on several different late evenings and early mornings, including in November, depicting the night sky.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defense lawyers plan to offer an expert to prove that Kohberger&apos;s cell phone was south of Pullman, Washington and west of Moscow, Idaho on the night of the killings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Gelman noted that Kohberger&apos;s DNA was found at the crime scene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The defense is doing a great job of muddying the waters because they are trying to show reasonable doubt which is all a juror needs to vote not guilty, but DNA doesn’t lie,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A date for Kohberger&apos;s trial has not yet been set. Prosecutors are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;seeking the death penalty&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Biden claims uncle vanished after crashing in area of New Guinea with cannibals; military has different story</title>
                    
                    <description>President Biden visited Pittsburgh on April 17, 2024, where he claimed his uncle vanished during WWII after his plane crashed in New Guinea, where cannibals lived.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;President Biden made &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/pennsylvania&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a stop in Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday where he told members of the United Steelworkers Union that his uncle vanished in an area of New Guinea that was populated with cannibals, after his plane crashed during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden told the steelworkers that after D-Day, his mother’s four brothers volunteered to join the military. One of those uncles, he said, was Ambrose Finnegan, who went by the nickname Bozey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was a hell of an athlete, they tell me, when he was a kid,&quot; Biden said, adding that he was in the Army air corps, which was in place before the Air Force came along. &quot;He flew those single-engine planes as reconnaissance over war zones, and he got shot down in New Guinea. They never found the body because there used to be, there were a lot of cannibals, for real, in that part of New Guinea.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president spoke with reporters earlier in the day before boarding Air Force One and heading out to Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-bogus-college-claim-just-latest-decades-long-pattern-embellishment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN&apos;S BOGUS COLLEGE CLAIM IS JUST LATEST IN DECADES-LONG PATTERN OF EMBELLISHMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told reporters he wanted to see how his uncle was memorialized in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/world-war-two&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;World War II memorial&lt;/a&gt; for those who lost their lives in the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When D-Day occurred, the next day, on Monday, all four of my mother’s brothers went down and volunteered to join the military,&quot; Biden said. &quot;Ambrose Finnegan, we called him Uncle Bozey, he was shot down. He was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/army&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Army Air&lt;/a&gt; Corps before there was an Air Force. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They never recovered his body, but the government went back when I went down there, and they checked and found some parts of the plane,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-biden-key-issue-impacting-voters-after-damaging-report-totally-lost-control&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP RIPS BIDEN ON KEY ISSUE IMPACTING VOTERS AFTER DAMAGING REPORT: ‘TOTALLY LOST CONTROL’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dpaa-mil.sites.crmforce.mil/dpaaProfile?id=a0Jt000001nzWi4EAE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;different record&lt;/a&gt; of what happened to Biden’s uncle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site said on May 14, 1944, an airplane carrying a crew of three and one passenger, identified as Finnegan, left Momote Airfield on Los Negros Island for a courier flight to New Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For unknown reasons, this plane was forced to ditch in the ocean off the north coast of New Guinea,&quot; the report reads. &quot;Both engines failed at low altitude, and the aircraft’s nose hit the water hard.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-facing-legal-challenges-after-declaring-war-on-chemical-industry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN ADMIN FACING LEGAL CHALLENGES AFTER DECLARING WAR ON CHEMICAL INDUSTRY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also said three men failed to emerge from the sinking wreck and were lost in the crash, while one crew member survived and was rescued by a barge. Finnegan has not been associated with any of the remains recovered from the area after the war and is still not accounted for, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden is no stranger to making questionable claims. Earlier this week, he claimed he was the &quot;first&quot; person in his family to &quot;go to college,&quot; while speaking in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I, like an awful lot of people in this audience, was the first in my family to go to college,&quot; Biden told the crowd. However, less than two years ago, during a speech in Pennsylvania, Biden told an audience his grandfather played college football. In the statement, he said his &quot;Grandfather Finnegan&quot; was an &quot;all-American football player&quot; in Santa Clara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-state-sues-biden-admin-over-environmental-justice-actions-dystopian-nightmare&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;REPUBLICAN STATE SUES BIDEN ADMIN OVER ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ACTIONS: &apos;DYSTOPIAN NIGHTMARE&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years before, when he ran for president in 1987, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vintage-biden-clip-resurfaces-law-school&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden exaggerated&lt;/a&gt; his academic record by bragging he graduated &quot;in the top half&quot; of his class while berating a reporter on the campaign trail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think I have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect,&quot; Biden told the reporter in New Hampshire at the time. &quot;I went to law school on a full academic scholarship, the only one in my class to have a full academic scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the first year of law school, I decided I didn&apos;t want to be in law school and ended up in the bottom two-thirds of my class,&quot; he said. &quot;And then I decided to stay, went back to law school and, in fact, ended up in the top half of my class.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He later admitted that he graduated 76th in a class of 85. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I did not graduate in the top half of my class at law school, and my recollection of this was inaccurate,&quot; he told The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I graduated from the University of Delaware with a double major in history and political science,&quot; he said. &quot;My reference to degrees at the Claremont event was intended to refer to these majors. I said &apos;three&apos; and should have said &apos;two.&apos;&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlet pointed out Biden received a single bachelor&apos;s degree in history and political science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Biden has told numerous stories that have also been deemed exaggerations. Mainstream outlets, including The Washington Post, have even called him out on them, including the publication&apos;s top fact-checker, Glenn Kessler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some stories Kessler addressed include Biden&apos;s claim he and his father saw two men in suits kissing each other in public when he was a teenager, that he was arrested for trying to see Nelson Mandela in South Africa and how, as vice president, he arranged for his uncle to be presented a Purple Heart that he was owed and never received. The uncle died in 1999, long before Biden was vice president. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden also repeated a false claim last year about his house burning down in his attempt to relate to those who lost their homes to wildfires ravaging Maui.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don’t want to compare difficulties, but we have a little sense, Jill and I, of what it was like to lose a home,&quot; Biden said. &quot;Years ago, now, 15 years, I was in Washington doing ‘Meet the Press&apos;… Lightning struck at home on a little lake outside the home, not a lake, a big pond. It hit the wire and came up underneath our home, into the … air condition ducts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To make a long story short, I almost lost my wife, my &apos;67 Corvette and my cat,&quot; the president added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2004 report from The Associated Press, archived by LexisNexis, said lightning struck the Bidens’ home and started a &quot;small fire that was contained to the kitchen.&quot; The report said firefighters got the blaze under control in 20 minutes and that they were able to keep the flames from spreading beyond the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital’s Jessica Chasmar, Gabriel Hayes, Joseph A. Wulfsohn, Joe Schoffstall and Cameron Cawthorne contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Pat McAfee, co-hosts lambaste ESPN colleagues&apos; Bill Belichick reporting: &apos;I’m glad we’re not a part of it&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Pat McAfee has been critical of his ESPN colleagues before. This time, he and his show co-hosts criticized a report about Bill Belichick.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After ESPN published a report about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-england-patriots&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Bill Belichick&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; failed job search this offseason, one of the network&apos;s top personalities, Pat McAfee, took issue with the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report said the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/atlanta-falcons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Atlanta Falcons&lt;/a&gt; didn&apos;t have Belichick in their top three of head coaching potential candidates, and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft allegedly advised Arthur Blank not to trust the eight-time Super Bowl winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also cited a source that said Belichick would never coach again in the NFL unless it were with Jerry Jones in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat McAfee and his co-hosts weren&apos;t fans of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boston Connor said there was context from the story that &quot;didn&apos;t make sense,&quot; while McAfee mentioned the &quot;bulls---&quot; Belichick has been surrounded by, according to Awful Announcing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connor said it was &quot;hard to believe&quot; Belichick was &quot;blindsided&quot; by not getting the Falcons job and questioned the anonymous quotes and &quot;bland statements&quot; throughout the piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;None of the quotes — they don&apos;t really say where they&apos;re from,&quot; Connor said, adding it was &quot;interesting&quot; the piece possibly referenced the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If they’re burying Bill, I’m glad we’re not a part of it,&quot; McAfee said. &quot;It sounds like it’s a lot of alluding to, anonymous quotes and things like that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then McAfee announced Belichick was joining the program&apos;s Draft Spectacular next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/marvin-harrison-jrs-former-ohio-state-teammate-cj-stroud-gives-nfl-teams-blunt-advice-dont-be-dumb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARVIN HARRISON JR&apos;S FORMER OHIO STATE TEAMMATE, CJ STROUD, GIVES NFL TEAMS BLUNT ADVICE: &apos;DON&apos;T BE DUMB&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&apos;t the first time McAfee was critical of members of his own network. He&apos;s previously aimed much higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McAfee called out Norby Williamson, the network&apos;s executive senior vice president of studio and event production at the time, saying he was &quot;attempting to sabotage our program&quot; and called him a rat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/espns-norby-williamson-out-nearly-40-years-months-pat-mcafee-called-out-top-exec-sabotage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Williamson left ESPN&lt;/a&gt; after 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belichick will not be employed by an NFL team for the first time since 1974. He had been the head coach of the New England Patriots for 24 seasons, winning six Super Bowls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Jason Kelce&apos;s Super Bowl ring &apos;officially gone&apos; after chili pool diving competition</title>
                    
                    <description>The Kelce brothers hosted The Great Lombaby Games at the University of Cincinnati, where competitors leaped into a pool of Skyline chili.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Jason Kelce is missing a very special piece of jewelry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a recent edition of Jason and brother Travis Kelce&apos;s popular &quot;New Heights&quot; podcast, the recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/eagles-jason-kelce-announces-retirement-nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;retired Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt; offensive lineman revealed he lost his coveted Super Bowl ring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ring commemorated the Eagles&apos; win over the Tom Brady-led New England Patriots in the 2018 Super Bowl. The victory marked the franchise&apos;s first and only Super Bowl title. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While misplacing a Super Bowl ring is something an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NFL champion&lt;/a&gt; hopes to avoid, the manner in which Kelce lost the ring was unusual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kelce brothers held the Great Lombaby Games at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-travis-kelce-chugs-beer-moments-before-receiving-college-diploma&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;University of Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;. At one point during the competition, participants were asked to secure a sock with accessories while jumping into chili-filled pools. Apparently, Kelce&apos;s championship ring was inside one of the socks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was an unfortunate-ness. As you guys know, this game existed because I continuously lose my Super Bowl ring, and I don’t even know if Travis still knows this, but I legitimately lost my Super Bowl ring in this event,&quot; Jason said on the latest &quot;New Heights&quot; episode. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/wrestlemania-40-eagles-greats-jason-kelce-lane-johnson-help-rey-mysterio-and-andrade-win-match&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WRESTLEMANIA 40: EAGLES GREATS JASON KELCE, LANE JOHNSON HELP REY MYSTERIO AND ANDRADE WIN MATCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason added that the pools of chili and everything inside of them had been discarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They could not find it. … All of this stuff has been thrown away. So, I think we can safely assume my Super Bowl ring is now in a landfill someplace in the Cincinnati Tri-State area. I didn’t think that would happen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travis has won three titles over his 11-year run with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kansas City Chiefs&lt;/a&gt;, and he did not hold back when he learned of his brother&apos;s mishap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You’re such a f-----g imbecile,&quot; the Chiefs tight end said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/newheightshow/status/1778586212506181680&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW MOMENT ON X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A metal detector was even used at one point during the search for the ring, but Jason eventually came to the conclusion his ring was &quot;officially gone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The only thing I can think of is, at some point, the sock got kicked out of the three-way, and it made its way out of the pool and that it was thrown away in some shape or form,&quot; the seven-time Pro Bowler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But, yes, the Super Bowl ring is officially gone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelce has already started an insurance claim process. Whether the insurance company will actually accept the claim and cover the loss remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think the insurance company might have some things to say about whether they’re going to cover that,&quot; Jason said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yeah, 100%,&quot; Travis replied, &quot;especially if you’re telling the entire world how you lost it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travis later offered a warning to viewers and listeners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do not do what Jason’s doing,&quot; the nine-time Pro Bowl tight end said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Baltimore prosecutors announced Wednesday the arrest of 24-year-old Dion Thompson, who is accused of killing Washington, D.C. police Sgt. Tony Mason Jr.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Baltimore prosecutors on Wednesday announced the arrest of a man in the cold case homicide of an off-duty &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/washington-dc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, police officer in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officer, Sgt. Tony Anthony Mason Jr., was shot to death while sitting in a parked car with a woman he had been dating, according to police. She was also shot but survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case sat unsolved for five years until detectives received a tip in early 2023 that reinvigorated their investigation and led to charges against Dion Thompson, 24, prosecutors said in a news release Wednesday. Thompson, who was 18 at the time of the shooting, is currently serving time in a federal prison on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;unrelated drug and gun charges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/skeletal-remains-found-illinois-home-identified-woman-missing-2008&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SKELETAL REMAINS FOUND AT ILLINOIS HOME IDENTIFIED AS WOMAN MISSING SINCE 2008&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An attorney representing Thompson in that case didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His charging documents in the 2017 shooting don’t include a clear statement of motive and they’re based almost entirely on the account of someone who knew Thompson but didn’t directly witness the crime. The person said Thompson admitted to shooting up a parked car because as he was leaving his friend’s grandmother’s house, he spotted a vehicle whose occupants he didn’t recognize and became paranoid, assuming they &quot;were there to either rob him or retaliate against him for all the robberies he was committing,&quot; according to the charging documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson learned later from watching the news that the victim was an off-duty police officer, the witness told detectives. Thompson then drove to Philadelphia to get rid of the vehicle he was driving the night of the shooting, prosecutors allege.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charging documents reference two other people who were allegedly involved in the shooting. One later died in a car crash. Officials said no one else has yet been charged in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mason, 40, was a 17-year veteran of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detectives noted that he was unarmed during the attack and wasn’t wearing any clothing to identify himself as a law enforcement officer. They said extensive background checks for both Mason and his companion turned up no signs of criminal or gang activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For far too long, the details surrounding Sergeant Mason’s tragic death have remained a painful mystery,&quot; said Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith. &quot;While we cannot erase the pain of loss or the memories of that day, we can take solace in the fact that the person responsible is being brought to justice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baltimore State’s Attorney Ivan Bates said this will be the first prosecution brought by his office’s new cold case unit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Fox News host Jesse Watters reacts to the love former President Donald Trump is receiving from voters across the country despite the media&amp;apos;s false claims about him.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News host Jesse Watters reacts to former President Trump’s popularity despite facing numeral legal cases and Democrats&apos; efforts to thwart his presidential campaign on &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jesse Watters Primetime&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JESSE WATTERS:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;i&gt;Yesterday, in a ‘Reaganesque’ move, Trump hit up a bodega in Harlem, which showed him a lot of love. ... Donald Trump wasn&apos;t treated like the racist dictator the media paints him as. He was greeted with love and affection by the very people the press tells you he hates. Now, if Harlem is chanting &quot;four more years&quot; to Trump, what is November going to look like? &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/npr-whistleblower-uri-berliner-resigns-i-cannot-work-newsroom-where-disparaged&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NPR WHISTLEBLOWER URI BERLINER RESIGNS: ‘I CANNOT WORK IN A NEWSROOM WHERE I AM DISPARAGED’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Harlem chanting, &quot;Trump, Trump, Trump&quot; while Donald says mentally ill, bad hombres are taking their jobs – that moment destroys all the propaganda. The spontaneity, the humanity, the reality of a moment like that renders all the talking points and all the hoaxes powerless. He&apos;s setting off chain reactions with moments like this.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Biden should borrow some of Trump&apos;s caged animal energy. You know, they said this election was a choice between love and hate. What they really mean is they hate how much you love them. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Belarus votes to suspend Conventional Forces participation</title>
                    
                    <description>Belarus&amp;apos; parliament on Wednesday voted to suspend Minsk&amp;apos;s participation in the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, which could lead to military expansion by the Lukashenko regime.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Belarusian parliament on Wednesday voted to suspend the country&apos;s participation in the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty that once was a key security doctrine for the continent, a 1990 agreement that was abandoned last year by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill, introduced by authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko earlier this month, could pave the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/belarus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;for Belarus&lt;/a&gt; — Russia’s ally in the war in Ukraine — to expand its military. Belarus lawmakers unanimously approved the bill calling for the treaty&apos;s suspension; Lukashenko now needs to sign the bill for it to become law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treaty, signed in 1990, places limits on tanks, combat vehicles, warplanes and heavy artillery that can be deployed in Europe. It aimed at keeping a military balance between the West and the countries that were part of the Cold War-era Warsaw Pact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/belarus-convicts-famous-dissident-rock-band-sentences-members-correctional-labor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BELARUS CONVICTS A FAMOUS DISSIDENT ROCK BAND AND SENTENCES ITS MEMBERS TO CORRECTIONAL LABOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Russia withdrew entirely from the treaty in November 2023 and NATO countries that were parties to it responded by suspending their participation just hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belarus hosts Russian tactical nuclear weapons, along with missiles and troops. The country has been used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;by Russia&lt;/a&gt; as a staging point for sending troops into Ukraine, but Belarusian forces have not taken part in the war that is now in its third year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Belarusian Defense Ministry, the treaty mandated that Belarus&apos; armed forces do not exceed 100,000 of troops and personnel. There are currently 63,000 troops and personnel in the Belarusian army, and some 300,000 men are in the reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Military experts say that after suspending its participation in the treaty, Belarus — which shares a border &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;with Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; and NATO members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland — will be able to expand its army and amass more weapons, although it doesn&apos;t mean it would definitely happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander Alesin, a military analyst based in the Belarusian capital Minsk, told The Associated Press that the country&apos;s pullout from the treaty had to do with Russia&apos;s discontent over Belarus still officially being in the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Russia was very unhappy,&quot; Alesin said. The withdrawal &quot;unties Belarus&apos; hands, but this does not automatically mean that the number of conventional weapons in the country will increase.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Russia has deployed tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, which is much more frightening to neighboring NATO countries,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>AJ Simon, a 2024 NFL Draft prospect as a pass rusher out of the University of Albany, died at the age of 25, the school&amp;apos;s football program announced Wednesday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amitral &quot;AJ&quot; Simon, a pass rusher who was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl-draft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; prospect, has died at the age of 25. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon’s school, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/albany-great-danes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;University of Albany&lt;/a&gt;, announced his death Wednesday, posting on social media that he was &quot;Forever a Great Dane.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The UAlbany football program was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of former student-athlete Amitral &quot;AJ&quot; Simon this morning,&quot; a team statement said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;AJ was a tremendous young man and even better teammate throughout his time at UAlbany. He was a role model both on and off the field, serving as a pillar to this program over the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He will be profoundly missed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of how Simon died have not yet been disclosed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/joel-klatt-coaches-in-full-panic-over-spring-transfer-portal-how-do-we-fix-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEL KLATT: COACHES IN FULL PANIC OVER SPRING TRANSFER PORTAL. HOW DO WE FIX IT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon was a first-team All-CAA defensive end, helping Albany to a semifinal appearance in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;FCS playoffs&lt;/a&gt; last season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greg Gattuso, the Great Danes’ head coach, wrote about Simon on X. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Two joyous year [sic] coaching and becoming friends with AJ Simon,&quot; he wrote. &quot;My prayers are dedicated to the Simon family. I love you AJ and will always have a special place in my heart for #8.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New England Patriots used one of their pre-draft visit slots with Simon last week, showing his chances of being drafted next week. However, experts had him going in the late rounds or signing with a team as an undrafted free agent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon started his collegiate career at Bloomsburg University before moving to Albany in 2022, where he totaled 29 tackles and 4½ sacks with one interception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last season, Simon had 50 tackles with 12 sacks and two passes defended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Simone Biles recalls fearing the worst after suffering ‘twisties’ in 2020 Olympics: ‘America hates me’</title>
                    
                    <description>Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles opened up about her struggles at the 2020 Games in Tokyo, revealing that she feared &amp;quot;America hates me&amp;quot; after her failed vault in the team final.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Simone Biles, among the most recognizable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/olympics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. Olympic athletes,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; opened up in a recent interview about the pressure she faced going into the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and how a bad bout of the &quot;twisties&quot; contributed to her eventually withdrawing from competition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biles explained during Wednesday’s episode of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/7bnjJ7Va1nM07Um4Od55dW&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&quot;Call Her Daddy&quot;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; podcast that she was suffering from the &quot;twisties,&quot; a term in gymnastics that generally refers to as a &quot;disconnect between the mind and body,&quot; long before her infamous vault routine in the team final in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In training, I was having twisties already, but I’m trying to push past that, and I would literally tell my teammates, ‘I’m fighting demons. I’m fighting demons right now, but I’m going to do it for you guys.’ Because the cords were not connected.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biles explained that it felt like her body and mind were &quot;fighting,&quot; but she had no choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I knew once I got up there — I’m chalking up — we can’t put Jordan [Chiles] in yet. I have to go. I have to put up a score. No matter what it is over the table, I have to put up a score.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biles underperformed. She lost herself midair and completed 1 1/2 twists instead of 2 1/2. She consulted with U.S. team doctor Marcia Faustin before walking off the field of play and being replaced by Chiles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/simone-biles-irked-jokes-husbands-comments-done-yet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SIMONE BILES IRKED OVER JOKES ABOUT HUSBAND&apos;S COMMENTS: &apos;ARE Y’ALL DONE YET?&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. won silver. But for Biles, the moment hadn’t passed. She now faced the fear of what her beloved fans would think of her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If I could’ve got on a plane and flown home, I would’ve done it. But as soon as I landed, I was like, ‘Oh, America hates me. The world is gonna hate me, and I can only see what they’re saying on Twitter right now.’ That was my first thought.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was like, ‘Holy s---. What are they gonna say about me?’&quot; she continued. &quot;I thought I was going to be banned from America.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biles pulled out of several events, but returned to win bronze on balance beam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She took two years off before returning in the fall of 2023 when she continued to increase her medal count at the gymnastics world championships. Biles’ return to the Olympics will be decided at the Olympic trials in June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>NPR CEO dodges question on if she should prioritize &apos;viewpoint diversity&apos; in newsroom following editor&apos;s exit</title>
                    
                    <description>NPR chief Katherine Maher dodged a question over whether she will ensure &amp;quot;viewpoint diversity&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;actually happening&amp;quot; following a veteran editor&amp;apos;s bombshell essay.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/npr-boss-called-first-amendment-challenge-reverence-truth-distraction&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Embattled NPR president and CEO Katherine Maher&lt;/a&gt; sidestepped a question about whether she should prioritize &quot;viewpoint diversity&quot; in the newsroom in the wake of the resignation of a veteran editor who sounded the alarm about the organization&apos;s liberal groupthink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a &lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/2024/04/17/disinformation-journalism-and-technology-conversation-with-katherine-maher-event-8276&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Maher was asked about &quot;viewpoint diversity,&quot; a topic NPR&apos;s senior business editor Uri Berliner tackled last week in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thefp.com/p/npr-editor-how-npr-lost-americas-trust&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;bombshell essay&lt;/a&gt; in The Free Press, which resulted in his suspension and exit following reported &quot;turmoil&quot; that erupted among colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is that kind of diversity something that you track or should track internally, or how do you get a handle on whether those things are actually happening or not?&quot; Carnegie senior fellow Jon Bateman, who moderated the &quot;Disinformation, Journalism, and Technology&quot; event, asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think that&apos;s reflected in the stories, right?&quot; Maher responded. &quot;I think that&apos;s reflected in what is the audience that we serve and how much value do they get out of our work. Tracking individual viewpoints- I mean, this is the thing about journalism is that, of course, people come from all sorts of backgrounds. They have different lived experiences, but they come to the table to do the work and uphold journalistic ethics and integrity. And that means reporting stories based on the facts. That means reporting stories matter. That means ensuring that we&apos;re rigorous with our sourcing. That means ensuring that we are focused on delivering what is accurate and what we know about the world today and then updating it again, right? Because the news is constantly changing and we&apos;re going to constantly need to follow those stories to make sure that we&apos;re really doing it well.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/npr-whistleblower-uri-berliner-resigns-i-cannot-work-newsroom-where-disparaged&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NPR WHISTLEBLOWER URI BERLINER RESIGNS: ‘I CANNOT WORK IN A NEWSROOM WHERE I AM DISPARAGED’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now that is what the most important work of journalism actually is. Are we covering the stories from a wide enough variety of perspectives? Is it reflected in how well the audience feels served? Do we have a wide enough audience that is representative of our nation? And so that, I think, is the priority and that&apos;s actually the way that we should be thinking about this,&quot; she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maher, who joined NPR last month, repeatedly insisted she has no editorial control over NPR&apos;s coverage. She also said she never had the chance to meet Berliner, telling Bateman, &quot;I wish in some ways that I had had that chance so that we could have talked about what his concerns were.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t have any editorial guidance on the newsroom, but it would have been interesting to hear and be able to think about structurally what can we do,&quot; Maher said before pointing to quarterly meetings with NPR stations she implemented and a monthly newsroom meeting addressing NPR&apos;s coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued, &quot;I think another piece of that is making sure we have active and robust debate in the newsroom from a wide variety of perspectives so that those conversations are being had. Again, that is something that is a newsroom leadership imperative. But giving people the ability to feel as though, that those conversations are welcomed, is creating a culture where those conversations are welcomed. Those are incredibly important priorities for us in order to be of service to the widest number of people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/5-things-veteran-npr-editor-exposed-stunning-criticism-own-employers-liberal-bias&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;5 THINGS VETERAN NPR EDITOR EXPOSED IN STUNNING CRITICISM OF OWN EMPLOYER’S LIBERAL BIAS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That isn&apos;t exactly how Berliner felt in the statement he released announcing his resignation Wednesday from NPR after 25 years at the outlet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am resigning from NPR, a great American institution where I have worked for 25 years. I don’t support calls to defund NPR. I respect the integrity of my colleagues and wish for NPR to thrive and do important journalism. But I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new CEO whose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cited in my Free Press essay,&quot; Berliner said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berliner was referring to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/npr-defends-embattled-ceo-against-bad-faith-attack-critics-unearth-far-left-social-media-posts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Maher&apos;s social media posts&lt;/a&gt;, which have surfaced in recent days displaying liberal activism and woke ideologies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his essay, Berliner criticized NPR&apos;s mishandling of Russiagate, the COVID lab leak theory, and the Hunter Biden laptop, arguing the 2016 election of Donald Trump quickly encouraged NPR journalists to find ways to &quot;damage or topple&quot; him as president. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berliner also revealed that among editorial staff in NPR&apos;s D.C. headquarters, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/npr-editor-found-registered-democrats-outnumbered-republicans-87-zero-newsroom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;87 were registered Democrats&lt;/a&gt; and zero were Republicans, which helped drive his public plea for viewpoint diversity at the organization. He also shared how NPR reporters are supposed to enter in demographic data like the race and gender of people they talk to for stories, in order to track the diversity of subjects and sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His piece angered colleagues, with some telling in-house media reporter David Folkenflik they didn’t want to work with him any longer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/npr-suspends-veteran-editor-who-blew-whistle-liberal-bias-organization&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Berliner was suspended for five days&lt;/a&gt; without pay and NPR told him it was a &quot;final warning&quot; and he would be shown the door if he violated NPR&apos;s policy about appearing on other news platforms without seeking permission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, he walked away on his own terms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reached for comment on Berliner&apos;s resignation, a spokesperson told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;NPR does not comment on individual personnel matters.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Study finds evidence of microplastics in brains and other organs</title>
                    
                    <description>Two recently-published studies investigated how microplastics can find their way inside the organs of both humans and mice, and what the potential impact can be.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two new studies have described the ways in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/science/highest-ever-concentration-microplastics-found-seafloor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;tiny microplastics&lt;/a&gt; can end up in humans&apos; organs – and even in the brains of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the studies, published in Environmental Health Perspectives on Apr. 10., involved feeding healthy mice microplastics over a period of four to eight weeks. Scientists later found that various organs in the mice were contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In mice that ingested microspheres, we detected &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/microplastics-found-overwhelming-majority-american-meat-water-plants-study&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;polystyrene microspheres&lt;/a&gt; in distant tissues including the brain, liver, and kidney,&quot; the study&apos;s results section reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Additionally, we report on the metabolic differences that occurred in the colon, liver, and brain, which showed differential responses that were dependent on concentration and type of microsphere exposure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/scientists-process-help-eliminate-toxic-chemicals-everyday-items&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SCIENTISTS REVEAL SIMPLE NEW PROCESS THAT MAY HELP ELIMINATE TOXIC CHEMICALS FROM EVERYDAY ITEMS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials on Apr. 5 experimented on both humans and mice. Researchers found that patients under 50 years old had significantly higher toxic substances in their gallstones – which are hardened pieces of excess bile in the gallbladder. After being fed microplastics, the gallstones of the mice in the study had formed at a faster rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our study revealed the presence of microplastics in human gallstones, showcasing their potential to aggravate chololithiasis by forming large cholesterol-microplastic heteroaggregates and altering the gut microbiota,&quot; the paper stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impacts of microplastics on humans is being investigated, and has caused widespread concern – especially because most Americans have been exposed to them their entire lives. Dr. Janette Nesheiwat told Fox News Digital that microplastics &quot;are everywhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/forever-chemicals-found-us-drinking-water-map-shows-hot-spots-highest-levels&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&apos;FOREVER CHEMICALS&apos; FOUND IN US DRINKING WATER, MAP SHOWS &apos;HOT SPOTS&apos; OF HIGHEST LEVELS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are consuming them unknowingly at unprecedented levels, ingesting them and inhaling them,&quot; she explained. &quot;Microplastics, especially at high levels, cause inflammation in the body.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Any foreign body such as a microplastic can cause irritation and inflammation in the body which can accumulate, disrupt normal cell function, and lead to an increase in organ injury.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nesheiwat said that microplastics have distinctly harmful effects depending on which organ they find their way to. To lower one&apos;s microplastic intake, she recommends choosing glass over plastic products and choosing foods with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/bottled-water-found-contain-tens-thousands-tiny-plastic-particles-new-study&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;lower microplastic contamination.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Microplastics can affect the liver by causing stress and inflammation and impairing liver function,&quot; she said. &quot;In the brain, it causes neuroinflammation and disrupts brain signaling.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel, however, told Fox News Digital that the impacts of microplastics on humans are still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Though we need to track this, there is still no direct evidence that microplastics in cells lead to untoward health outcomes,&quot; he explained. &quot;This may be proven wrong as more accumulate, and I am certainly concerned about cancer risks from chemical spills or in contaminated water or areas where waste was poorly stored in the environment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At the same time, the greatest health risks still come from sedentary behavior, obesity, untreated high blood pressure, poor sleep and little exercise,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews/health&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Chargers sign JK Dobbins to 1-year deal as Jim Harbaugh brings in another ex-Ravens player: reports</title>
                    
                    <description>J.K. Dobbins is hoping he can stay healthy this season, as he&amp;apos;s reportedly signing with the Los Angeles Chargers following an injury-laden tenure with the Baltimore Ravens.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The theme of ex-&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/baltimore-ravens&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Baltimore Ravens&lt;/a&gt; heading west to the Los Angeles Chargers continued on Wednesday as running back J.K. Dobbins is signing on to join Jim Harbaugh’s inaugural roster, his agency LAA Sports told ESPN. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jk-dobbins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Dobbins is signing&lt;/a&gt; a one-year pact with the team, per multiple reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dobbins will reunite with his offensive coordinator from the Ravens, Greg Roman, who serves in the same role under Harbaugh. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dobbins will also team up with his former Ravens backfield mate, Gus Edwards, who signed a two-year deal with Los Angeles. Former Ravens tight end Hayden Hurst, who played for the Carolina Panthers last season, also joined the Chargers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second-round pick by Baltimore in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl-draft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2020 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;, Dobbins showed promise when he rushed for 805 yards with nine touchdowns in his rookie campaign. But he simply hasn’t stayed healthy since. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ravens-j-k-dobbins-will-miss-rest-season-tearing-achilles-against-texans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAVENS&apos; J.K. DOBBINS WILL MISS REST OF SEASON AFTER TEARING ACHILLES AGAINST TEXANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Dobbins never got to play after tearing his ACL just before the start of the season. He also tore his meniscus and LCL in the horrific injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2022, he hurt the same knee, needing arthroscopic surgery after just eight games played. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And optimism that he could stay healthy in 2023 went south after just eight rushing attempts, where he tore his Achilles against the Tennessee Titans in Week 1, ending his season yet again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dobbins is obviously hoping he can stay healthy, and the Chargers hope it can come with his elusive abilities he’s been able to showcase when he’s on the field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with Edwards’ ground-and-pound rushing style, Roman’s rush attack could complement the pass game, which has been the talking point with Keenan Allen and Mike Williams no longer on the squad. Only Joshua Palmer and Quentin Johnston are expected starters at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>An Albany police officer was shot and injured Wednesday after attempting to pull over a vehicle before he returned fire, killing the driver, police said.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Albany, New York&lt;/a&gt;, police officer was shot early Wednesday after attempting to pull over a vehicle before he returned fire, killing the driver, authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Police Chief&lt;/a&gt; Eric Hawkins said the officer had witnessed a speeding vehicle just before 12:30 a.m. A short pursuit ensued, and the driver refused to stop, Hawkins said. A short time later, the officer saw the vehicle parked along a road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officer, footage from his body-worn camera reveals, approached the vehicle. When he was about 5 feet away, the driver emerged from the car and &quot;immediately&quot; started firing at the officer, striking him in the upper thigh. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officer immediately returned fire, striking the suspect, Hawkins said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the officer and the suspect were transported to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Albany Medical Center Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. The suspect was pronounced deceased at 1:13 a.m. The officer underwent surgery and was later reported as alert and conscious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We just experienced one of an officer&apos;s worst nightmares, and that is being ambushed performing a routine part of their duties,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkins said he looked at footage from the officer&apos;s body-worn camera. &quot;There&apos;s no other way to describe this, but an ambush,&quot; he said. &quot;This officer was doing exactly what he was supposed to be doing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/suburban-st-louis-officer-fatally-shoots-18-year-old-killed-man-gas-station&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUBURBAN ST. LOUIS OFFICER FATALLY SHOOTS 18-YEAR-OLD WHO KILLED MAN AT GAS STATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The footage, released by Albany police, shows the officer approaching a vehicle with its driver-side door open when a man emerges from behind the car with his arm raised and pointed at the officer. Two loud bangs are heard, and the officer begins to run away, making pained noises before saying &quot;shots fired&quot; as the video cuts off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albany Mayor Kathy Sheehan said at the news conference that there are indications that the man &quot;is somebody with a troubled history, not necessarily a criminal history.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she was grateful that she was able to speak to the officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This was not what he expected to happen today during his shift,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Albany Police Department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The names of the officer and the suspect have not been released.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Fani Willis prosecutor scolded by Georgia judge in shouting match: &apos;Should have gotten yourself together&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>The judge and Fulton County prosecutors in the Young Thug case got into a fiery exchange Wednesday when he excluded some evidence from the case.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/georgia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Georgia prosecutor&lt;/a&gt; from Fulton County District Attorney Fanni Willis&apos; office got into a shouting match Wednesday with the judge overseeing the trial of rapper Young Thug as the pair argued over evidentiary matters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Deputy District Attorney Adriane Love and Fulton County Judge Ural Glanville got into a heated shouting match when the judge ruled that the evidence Love wanted to introduce would be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why didn&apos;t we file this stuff months ago and let&apos;s wind it out and air it out at that point in time,&quot; Glanville told the defense before asking Love about the matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge asked Love if prosecutors had discussions about the evidence before excluding the material. As Love began voicing her frustration, Glanville said: &quot;Well then you all should have gotten yourself together beforehand.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/young-thug-label-rapper-fn-dadealer-faces-murder-charge-atlanta-shooting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOUNG THUG LABEL RAPPER FN DADEALER FACES MURDER CHARGE FOLLOWING ATLANTA SHOOTING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Have a seat, madam. Have a seat,&quot; he said after telling court officers to summon the jury, which was not present during the exchange. &quot;You better exclude that and next time, make sure you&apos;re prepared.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love argued that her team tried discussing the evidence with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/in-court&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the defense.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh it&apos;s going to be inadmissible right now,&quot; Glanville replied. &quot;I am not going to have any more discussion about this, madam.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Judge, we talked to them this morning about that! And I attempted to talk to them earlier this week!&quot; Love shouted. &quot;Your honor, so the court punishes the state because (of) the defense?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m not punishing anybody,&quot; the judge replied. &quot;But prior preparation prevents poor performance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rapper-young-thug-arrested-atlanta-gang-activity-charges&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAPPER YOUNG THUG ARRESTED IN ATLANTA ON CRIMINAL STREET GANG ACTIVITY CHARGES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We prepared, judge! That&apos;s why I sent them what I sent them last week! A whole week and a half ago! Two weeks, your honor!&quot; Love yelled before Glanville told her the jury was coming into the room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love&apos;s boss, Fani Willis, has garnered national attention for her prosecution of former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Trump&lt;/a&gt; for alleged election interference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Willis was accused of having an &quot;improper&quot; relationship with Nathan Wade, the special counsel she hired to prosecute Trump. She was also accused of financially benefiting from the position Wade held in her office. Both Willis and Wade denied the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fulton-county-prosecutor-nathan-wade-withdraws-trump-case-allowing-da-fani-willis-continue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Wade resigned from the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Willis to stay on it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love is the lead prosecutor in the trial against Young Thug, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/atlanta&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Atlanta-based&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hip-hop artist, who&apos;s given name is Jeffery Lamar Williams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams and six others are charged in connection with participating in a criminal street gang responsible for violent crimes. In addition, he is accused of racketeering conspiracy as well as drug and gun charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young Thug achieved tremendous success after starting to rap as a teenager and serves as CEO of his own record label, Young Stoner Life, or YSL. Artists on his record label are considered part of the &quot;Slime Family,&quot; and a compilation album, &quot;Slime Language 2,&quot; rose to No. 1 on the charts in April 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But prosecutors say YSL also stands for Young Slime Life, which they allege is an Atlanta-based violent street gang affiliated with the national Bloods gang and founded by Young Thug and two others in 2012. Prosecutors say people named in the indictment are responsible for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;violent crimes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — including killings, shootings and carjackings — to collect money for the gang, burnish its reputation and expand its power and territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Jimmy Kimmel says Biden&apos;s Trump joke was clever &apos;for a guy who can’t put two sentences together’</title>
                    
                    <description>Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel responded to President Biden&amp;apos;s recent joke about former President Trump&amp;apos;s financial struggles, saying it was a &amp;quot;pretty good one.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After President Biden joked about his rival former President Trump’s current financial woes, late night show host Jimmy Kimmel argued Tuesday that it was a pretty good jab for somebody so infamous for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-mocked-after-im-20th-century-gaffe-finally-got-something-right&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;verbal gaffes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-threatened-with-jail-he-misses-hush-money-trial-biden-campaigns-pennsylvania&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden jokingly&lt;/a&gt; told a made-up story to a small crowd in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, &quot;Just the other day, a defeated-looking guy came up to me and asked if I could help. He was drowning in debt. And I said, ‘I’m sorry, Donald, but I can’t help you.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That’s what we need,&quot; Kimmel said in reaction to the clip, &quot;Pretty good one for a guy who can’t put two sentences together.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the monologue, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the talk show host&lt;/a&gt; had been discussing Trump’s financial struggles, saying, &quot;Shares for his media company have plummeted. They’re down 70% since they went public a couple of weeks ago. They were down another 14% today.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-caught-crib-notes-reporters-question-prior-calling-her-press-conference&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN CAUGHT WITH CRIB NOTES DETAILING REPORTER&apos;S QUESTION PRIOR TO CALLING ON HER DURING PRESS CONFERENCE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His in-studio audience applauded at that news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimmel went on to show a purported stock tracker for the Trump Media &amp;amp; Technology stock, saying, &quot;You can see, the big drop that occurred yesterday, but even weirder, if you take those peaks and valleys from the past week or so, and you flip them on their side, and then add a little bit of color to them,&quot; showing how the image appeared to resemble a caricature of Trump’s face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also joked, &quot;If you bought Trump stock two weeks ago, and shame on you if you did, you lost half your money, but if you hold on just a little bit longer you might be able to lose all of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-state-of-the-union-speech-reinforced-mental-acuity-age-concerns-republicans-say&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN&apos;S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH REINFORCED MENTAL ACUITY AND AGE CONCERNS, REPUBLICANS SAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/trump-media-stock-plummets-company-files-issue-millions-more-shares&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trump Media &amp;amp; Technology Group&apos;s (TMTG)&lt;/a&gt; stock price plunged by more than 15% on Monday after the parent company of Trump&apos;s Truth Social platform filed to sell millions of more shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of TMTG have retreated sharply since their market debut on March 26, falling 60% from the opening price of $70.90. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>College basketball transfer portal power rankings: Top 10 available players</title>
                    
                    <description>A pair of Duke stars — Jeremy Roach and Mark Mitchell — are among the top players currently available in the transfer portal. See who else is on the market!</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Offseason? What offseason? There&apos;s no such thing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;college basketball&lt;/a&gt;! And we&apos;re not complaining, because the sport is fascinating to follow even after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/connecticut-huskies-team&quot;&gt;UConn&lt;/a&gt; was crowned the national champion last week. Roster construction is changing across the country by the minute. When it&apos;s all said and done, there will be in the neighborhood of 2,000 names in college basketball&apos;s transfer portal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should the portal and NIL money be regulated? We can discuss that until the sun comes up, but you can&apos;t deny the volume of player movement — and storylines with that movement — around college hoops. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, one of the largest names in the portal both in size and impact decided to take his talents to Mike Woodson in Bloomington, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/oumar-ballo-player&quot;&gt;Oumar Ballo&lt;/a&gt; committing to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/indiana-hoosiers-team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was No. 1 across the country in many transfer portal player rankings, having averaged 12.9 points and 10.1 rebounds per game this past season and setting an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/arizona-wildcats-team&quot;&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; record for career field goal percentage at 64%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, let&apos;s reset and take a look at where we stand in the portal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are my top-10 names to monitor, and others to keep an eye on, as the wild, wild west nature of this period of roster construction forges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/johnell-davis-player&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Johnell Davis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/florida-atlantic-owls-team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florida Atlantic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Athletic Conference Co-Player of the Year this past season, Davis is testing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/nba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt; Draft waters as well, but has his name in the portal and is a highly sought-after talent. A 6-foot-4, 203-pound bulldog, Davis is a tough guard who can score in a variety of ways, having averaged 18.2 points per game while rebounding well for his size at 6.3 per contest. A key part of FAU&apos;s Final Four run in 2023, Davis is experienced and impacts the game on both ends of the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/aj-storr-player&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AJ Storr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/wisconsin-badgers-team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second team All-Big Ten selection had 11 performances of at least 20 points this past season as a Badger, averaging 16.8 points per game. At 6-7, his ability to create tough matchups on the perimeter was on display plenty of times this past season. One note reflecting the wild nature of college hoops: if Storr does return to college basketball and elects to transfer, it will be his third school in as many years after he started his career at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/st-johns-red-storm-team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;St. John&apos;s&lt;/a&gt;. The offensive prowess that he presents makes him such a valuable name because he would change the complexion of a team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/jeremy-roach-player&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeremy Roach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/duke-blue-devils-team&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point guard play makes or breaks a team in college basketball, and the 6-2 Duke transfer sent shockwaves through the sport on Tuesday night when announcing he is heading to a new destination for his fifth season. Roach has been a key weapon on a Final Four team and helped the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/duke-blue-devils-team&quot;&gt;Blue Devils&lt;/a&gt; to the Elite Eight last season. This comes off as a choice by the Duke court general to capitalize on the money. Averaging 14 points and 3.3 assists per game, Roach plays with swagger and would add a seasoned presence and poise to a team. Could we see some drama in his next destination? A battle between John Calipari, Rick Pitino and Mark Pope is on the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/clifford-omoruyi-player&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clifford Omoruyi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/rutgers-scarlet-knights-team&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rutgers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An All-Big Ten selection and one of the best defensive players in college basketball with 2.9 blocks per game (which ranked third in the nation), Omoruyi is a hard-nosed veteran who is the best big man on the market currently. He&apos;s been a part of two NCAA Tournament teams with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/rutgers-scarlet-knights-team&quot;&gt;Scarlet Knights&lt;/a&gt; and is a double-double type of piece, having averaged 10.4 points and 8.3 rebounds per game as a senior. Here are his 12 finalists:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Ballo off the board, look for Omoruyi to only try to hike the price up.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/great-osobor-player&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great Osobor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/utah-state-aggies-team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utah State&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mountain West Player of the Year and an AP All-American Honorable Mention, Osobor is a 6-8, 250-pound forward who averaged 17.7 points and 9.0 rebounds per game for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/utah-state-aggies-team&quot;&gt;Aggies&lt;/a&gt; and was the top talent in a six-bid conference for the NCAA Tournament. With more than a block and a steal per game, along with shooting marks close to 60%, Osobor has only gotten better and is a hot commodity right now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/mark-mitchell-2-player&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Mitchell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: Duke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With No. 1 ranked recruit Cooper Flagg coming into the Blue Devils program, Mitchell was automatically going to take a back seat as Jon Scheyer has the nation&apos;s top-ranked recruiting class. So, Mitchell is seeking a new destination and is a large name for both his experience and upside in a different system. At 6-9, he is a versatile forward who, with time to work on the jump shot, could be a really intriguing prospect. This past year, he averaged 11.6 points on 54% shooting from the floor and 6.0 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/robbie-avila-player&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robbie Avila&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/indiana-state-sycamores-team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indiana State&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He developed a cult-like following throughout March, getting nicknamed &quot;Cream Abdul-Jabbar&quot; for his unique and versatile toolbox, as he averaged 17.4 points, 6.6 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/indiana-state-sycamores-team&quot;&gt;Sycamores&lt;/a&gt;, charging now-Saint Louis head coach Josh Schertz&apos;s team to the NIT championship game. There&apos;s a good possibility Avila follows Schertz to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/saint-louis-billikens-team&quot;&gt;Billikens&lt;/a&gt; program, but never say never in this ever-changing world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/aidan-mahaney-player&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aidan Mahaney&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/saint-marys-gaels-team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saint Mary&apos;s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a big piece of news on Tuesday night when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/saint-marys-gaels-team&quot;&gt;Gaels&lt;/a&gt; leading scorer, a two-time first-team All-WCC performer who had totaled over 900 points in two seasons, announced that he was portaling. With close to 17 points per contest on 57% shooting from the floor during the conference tournament this past season, Mahaney led Saint Mary&apos;s to the program&apos;s first WCC Tournament crown in five years. This is a massive loss for Randy Bennett, as the 6-3 guard has 50 starts in two seasons under his belt and knows how to run a team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/jonas-aidoo-player&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jonas Aidoo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/tennessee-volunteers-team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tennessee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rising senior will be a highly sought-after big man because he does so many things right and comes from great coaching with Rick Barnes, meaning playing hard is non-negotiable. Averaging 11.4 points, 7.3 rebounds and 1.8 blocks while playing almost 25 minutes per game, the 6-11, 241-pound big man is productive in a variety of ways. In the analytics world, he&apos;s even higher on the list than No. 9. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/rylan-griffen-player&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rylan Griffen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/alabama-crimson-tide-team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alabama&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeal factor is that he was a key contributor on Alabama&apos;s first-ever Final Four team, averaging 11.2 points and 3.4 rebounds per game while shooting 45% from the floor and 39% from 3-point territory. While defense is a question mark, Griffen&apos;s bucket-getting ability and his 6-6 frame make him a tough cover for any team, and he would bring a lot of experience to the fold of a program. The fact that he has two years of eligibility left is also a positive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 other names to watch:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;John Fanta is a national college basketball broadcaster and writer for FOX Sports.

                    <title>Jared Goff says &apos;discussions&apos; with Lions for new deal are ongoing: &apos;Would love to be here for a long time&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff confirmed to reporters Tuesday discussions between his agent and the Lions about a new deal are ongoing.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Jared Goff has helped turn around the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/detroit-lions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Detroit Lions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in his brief time with the team, and he&apos;s hoping to continue that success in Detroit with a long-term deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a press conference Tuesday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jared-goff&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Goff fielded several questions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about where he and the Lions were on a possible contract extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There’s been discussions. My agent’s on top of it. He’s doing a good job, and I trust those guys,&quot; Goff said. &quot;I’m not in control of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s been amazing, man,&quot; he added. &quot;I love it here and would love to be here for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s been really special, like I mentioned, playing in front of these fans and being able to provide a winning culture in the last year and a half or so. To see them experience that and be able to be a part of that has been fun. But by no means are we satisfied or happy to be here or any of that. It’s about what’s next now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/looking-back-lions-historic-2023-season-hope-heartbreak&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LOOKING BACK AT LIONS&apos; HISTORIC 2023 SEASON: FROM HOPE TO HEARTBREAK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goff was traded after the 2020 season to the Lions by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/los-angeles-rams&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Los Angeles Rams&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for Matthew Stafford and several draft picks. Stafford won a Super Bowl with the Rams, but Goff eventually had his own success with the Lions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last season, the Lions won the franchise’s first playoff game in 32 years after defeating the Rams in the wild-card round. It ended a nine-game postseason losing streak, the longest in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;NFL history.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It means a whole lot to this city,&quot; Goff said after the win. &quot;We knew what it meant when this season started to get into the playoffs and then to get this win. And, you know, it’s just the beginning for us. We’ve got some run left.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goff is entering the final year of a four-year contract he signed in 2019. He is due to make $22.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Cheryl Burke admits to &apos;showmances&apos; with 3 &apos;DWTS&apos; partners, names 1: Dancing is an &apos;intimate contact sport&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Cheryl Burke revealed that she had &amp;quot;showmances&amp;quot; with three of her partners during her time on &amp;quot;Dancing with the Stars.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; alum &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cheryl-burke-explains-dancing-with-the-stars-curse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Cheryl Burke&lt;/a&gt; revealed that she had &quot;showmances&quot; with three of her celebrity partners during her time on the hit series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the 39-year-old former professional dancer reflected on her 26-season run on the ABC dance competition show during an appearance on &quot;The Amy &amp;amp; T.J. Podcast.&quot; While discussing the inspiration behind the name of her &quot;DWTS&quot; podcast &quot;Sex, Lies &amp;amp; Spray Tans,&quot; Burke was asked if there was a lot of &quot;sex going on behind-the-scenes&quot; during filming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Obviously!&quot; Burke told hosts Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes. &quot;I mean, like, look. There was lots of dry humping because that happens in the rumba. Right? There&apos;s lots of that. Look, dancing, especially ballroom, is an intimate contact sport.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued, &quot;And it happens! It does happen. And, look, I&apos;ll be the first. I&apos;m not gonna say who, but I&apos;ve had my own showmances. You know? It happened.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dancing-with-the-stars-pro-cheryl-burke-show-saved-life&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;‘DANCING WITH THE STARS’ PRO CHERYL BURKE REFLECTS ON HOW SHOW HAS ‘SAVED’ HER LIFE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/amy-robach-chokes-describes-feeling-career-pressure-relationship-t-j-holmes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Robach and Holmes&lt;/a&gt; that the show doesn&apos;t have a policy against relationships between the pro dancers and the celebrity contestants. She noted that rumored romances between &quot;DWTS&quot; pairs often made headlines, saying, &quot;Supposedly, I had showmance with every single partner, including Wayne Newton.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was that girl,&quot; Burke said, &quot;Yeah, I was definitely labeled as that woman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about how many showmances she actually had, Burke admitted, &quot;I would say that it&apos;s three.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Burke explained that it was challenging to make showmances work outside the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That was the problem,&quot; Burke said. &quot;Because it&apos;s seven days a week.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke pointed out that there were &quot;a lot of great relationships&quot; that came out of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People got married from the show, right?&quot; she said. &quot;But it&apos;s seven days a week. You are consumed with each other.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Also we&apos;ve seen their insecurities,&quot; Burke continued. &quot;They&apos;re vulnerable, and especially as a professional woman who was a ballroom dancer teaching, let&apos;s say the athlete, for example, who feels like this macho [person], all of a sudden has to be like, &apos;I don&apos;t know if I can shift.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In order to be successful on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/dancing-with-the-stars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;‘Dancing With the Stars,’&lt;/a&gt; you have to be ready to be vulnerable,&quot; she added. &quot;Like you got to feel stupid. You got to look stupid. You got to be okay with that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robach noted that the celebrity contestants need to establish trust with their pro partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&apos;s the thing. Because if you don&apos;t [trust], your life is going to be a living hell with me,&quot; Burke said with a laugh. &quot;But the trust has to come soon. Like it&apos;s not normal to trust someone after only a few days, right?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke recalled that she tried to continue a relationship with one of her partners after the show wrapped, but &quot;it just wasn&apos;t going to happen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if she fell in love with any of her partners, Burke said that her showmances were based on &quot;lust.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s not love, right?&quot; Burke said. &quot;It is in that moment. Then you&apos;re like, ‘Wait a second, how is this person, like in the real world?’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All of a sudden the rules change, like I&apos;m no longer an influence in that sense,&quot; she explained. &quot;So it&apos;s a weird control thing, you know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke went on to name &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/former-bengals-star-chad-ochocinco-johnson-hints-hes-joining-nfl-staff-i-got-a-job-with-the-raiders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chad Ochocinco Johnson&lt;/a&gt; as one &quot;DWTS&quot; partner with whom she had a showmance, recalling that the former professional football player &quot;basically professed his love to me&quot; on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Johnson, 46, competed on the 10th season of &quot;DWTS&quot; and was paired with Burke. The two sparked romance rumors at the time, which were further fueled when Johnson gave Burke a $10,000 diamond ring during an episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People were like, &apos;Oh, you&apos;re engaged! He gave you a diamond!&apos;&quot; Burke remembered &quot;And I was like, &apos;No.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke joined &quot;DWTS&quot; as a pro dancer for the show&apos;s second season in 2006. She competed in 26 seasons before leaving the series after its season 31 finale in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though she never publicly dated anyone from &quot;DWTS,&quot; Burke met her future husband &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/matthew-lawrence-shares-fired-agency-refusing-strip-director&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Matthew Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; on the show&apos;s set in 2006 when his brother Joey Lawrence was a celebrity contestant. Burke and Lawrence split in 2008 after a year of dating but reconnected in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two tied the knot in May 2019 but divorced in 2022. During her appearance on the &quot;Amy &amp;amp; T.J.&quot; podcast, Burke told the former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/abc-tj-holmes-amy-robach-asphyxiated-disney-extramarital-affair-makes-national-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;GMA3&quot; hosts&lt;/a&gt; that she isn&apos;t ready to date again yet, adding that she doesn&apos;t have a specific timeline for when she will be open to another romantic relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I would love to plan my whole life like that on a timeline, but, like, I&apos;m trying to be a recovering control freak, though,&quot; she said. &quot;I&apos;m still a major micromanager, but, I just need to know me first.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I need to really be comfortable in my own skin, or else I&apos;m gonna fall into that same pattern of clearly of what didn&apos;t work for me,&quot; Burke added. &quot;I wasn&apos;t a great picker.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
