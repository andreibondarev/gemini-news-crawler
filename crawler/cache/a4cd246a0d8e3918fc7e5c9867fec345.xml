                    <title>Extremists rise in new Palestinian Authority government as Biden threatens Israel over Gaza war</title>
                    
                    <description>The State Department recently welcomed the formation of a new Palestinian Authority government in Ramallah amid accusations that at least two of the new ministers hold extremist views.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM – The new Palestinian Authority (PA) government sworn into office this week by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/palestinian-leader-appoints-longtime-adviser-prime-minister-face-reform&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;PA President Mahmoud Abbas &lt;/a&gt;– and warmly welcomed by the White House and the State Department – includes at least two ministers who hold extreme and racist views toward Israel and Jews, Palestinian Media Watch (PMW), an Israeli organization that draws attention to Palestinian extremism, has revealed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing articles in the Palestinian media and video clips from recent public events, PMW revealed how the new minister of religious affairs, Muhammad Mustafa Najem, has openly incited violence against Israelis as a religious imperative, characterizing Jews as evil and treacherous, and quoted a verse from the Quran that refers to Jews as &quot;apes and pigs.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another member of the new government, Minister of Women’s Affairs Muna Al-Khalili, is shown to have praised Palestinian terror and, as recently as last month at a conference in Egypt, claimed that the brutal Hamas terror attacks on Oct. 7 – the worst atrocity committed against Jews since the Holocaust in World War II – was an act of legitimate resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/biden-warns-netanyahu-that-us-will-change-policy-on-gaza-unless-israel-protects-civilians&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU THAT US WILL CHANGE POLICY ON GAZA UNLESS ISRAEL PROTECTS CIVILIANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Hamas’ attacks and the subsequent war with Israel that has ravaged much of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/world-un-signals-no-exit-civilians-caught-gaza-war-politically-toxic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;, the U.S. administration has been urging Abbas to reform and revitalize his governing authority, which has long been accused of corruption and extremism, so that it might be part of a solution for governing Gaza – in addition to the West Bank – after the war. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes made this week, which Abbas said would include plans for institutional reform, restructuring and unifying institutions, as well as fighting corruption, raising the level of services and a digital transformation, are being viewed by the U.S. as part of its desired reformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many Palestinians have said no real change can take place as long as Abbas remains at the helm; and Israeli leaders, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/benjamin-netanyahu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a&gt;, remain steadfast in rejecting the idea that the authority will be part of any post-war solution for Gaza, pointing out that it is just as problematic as Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/biden-vision-for-palestinian-state-doomed-experts-an-explicit-recognition-of-hamas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN&apos;S VISION FOR A PALESTINIAN STATE DOOMED, EXPERTS SAY: &apos;AN EXPLICIT RECOGNITION OF HAMAS&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The assumption that a &apos;revitalized&apos; Palestinian Authority will bring moderate and pragmatic figures, or soften the Palestinian position toward Israel, is totally false,&quot; Khaled Abu Toameh, a Palestinian affairs analyst based in Jerusalem, told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it was totally unrealistic to expect the new cabinet ministers to &quot;endorse a pragmatic approach toward Israel,&quot; especially with the war in Gaza raging, and pointed out that even &quot;many Palestinians do not understand the difference between the new Palestinian government and the previous one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In his first speech at the cabinet meeting, the new prime minister, Mohammed Mustafa, also employed hardline rhetoric against Israel because of the war in Gaza, while completely ignoring Hamas’ responsibility,&quot; Abu Toameh said, adding, &quot;in this regard, he sounded exactly like his predecessor, Mohammed Shtayyeh.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that Shtayyeh, who quit as prime minister in February, also spoke about refoming the authority but &quot;not much happened.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/why-mideast-neighbors-wont-offer-refuge-palestinians-stuck-gaza-war-zone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHY MIDEAST NEIGHBORS WON&apos;T OFFER REFUGE TO PALESTINIANS STUCK IN GAZA WAR ZONE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change will not happen &quot;as long as President Mahmoud Abbas and his inner circle are the real and sole decision-makers,&quot; Abu Toameh said. &quot;At the end of the day, the cabinet reshuffle came to appease the U.S. administration, and not out of a sincere desire to introduce financial and administrative reforms or engage in a peace process with Israel.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv who closely follows events in Palestinian society, also said the new Palestinian Authority leadership was unlikely to bring about any significant changes if Abbas was still in charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The appointment of Mohammed Mustafa is really just replacing one Mohammed with another Mohammed,&quot; he said. &quot;He is part of the same production line.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael said Mustafa, who previously served as the deputy prime minister and minister of the economy, was a close ally and adviser of Abbas and &quot;he will do whatever Abbas tells him to do.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He is there in order to preserve the interests of Abbas and the last interest of Abbas is reform,&quot; Michael said, calling the current Palestinian Authority &quot;a lost cause.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responding to the announcement of the new Palestinian government, however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/state-department&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson Mathew Miller said in a statement that &quot;the United States looks forward to working with the new cabinet to promote peace, security, and prosperity and will be engaging this new government to deliver on credible reforms.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/world-health-organization-silent-hamas-use-gaza-hospital-terror-hq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SILENT OVER HAMAS’ USE OF GAZA HOSPITAL AS TERROR HQ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A revitalized PA is essential to delivering results for the Palestinian people in both the West Bank and Gaza and establishing the conditions for stability in the broader region,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responding to a Fox News Digital request for a comment about the racist and inciting public statements attributed to newly appointed Palestinian ministers, a State Department Spokesman said &quot;We are aware of reports that certain P.A. cabinet members have used unacceptable language. We have been absolutely clear on this score: Inflammatory, hateful, or dehumanizing speech by any party does not advance peace.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Palestinian Authority spokesman contacted by Fox News Digital did not comment on the claims by publication time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Schanzer, the senior vice president for research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, told Fox News Digital that the U.S. was &quot;perpetuating the fiction of a reformed Palestinian government&quot; and was ignoring its problematic nature in order to achieve its own objectives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mohammed Mustafa is not a reformer, he is a longtime crony of Mahmoud Abbas who has benefited from the corrupt system that Abbas has presided over now for nearly two decades,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it&apos;s important to note that if Abbas remains president of this government – and he is now 19 years into a four-year term – this is not reform.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When we see the rhetoric of some of these individuals, we can see that not only are they not reformers, but they are also in fact radicals, and this should undermine the entire process that is underway,&quot; said Schanzer, adding that the administration was so focused on its objective of having the Palestinian Authority &quot;inherit the Gaza Strip,&quot; that it was &quot;willing to turn a blind eye to a wide range of problems in order to try to achieve this objective.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I believe that ignoring these problems will ultimately lead us down the same path we have been on for years and years and years,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>California turns out a lot of college students each year. Learn which California colleges and universities are the largest by population size.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the most populous state in the nation, California educates hundreds of thousands of college students each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the Golden State is home to the largest higher-education system in the U.S., according to the Public Policy Institute of California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 10 campuses that comprise the University of California system are the state’s main academic research institution, while the California State University system is the largest public four-year, higher-education system in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous community colleges and private universities also dot the state&apos;s map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/virtues-courage-compassion-work-friendship-taught-bill-bennett-elayne-bennett&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;VIRTUES OF COURAGE, COMPASSION, WORK, FRIENDSHIP — THESE MUST BE TAUGHT, SAY BILL BENNETT, ELAYNE BENNETT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having so many options for higher education keeps the student bodies of each campus smaller than those of some other states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the biggest schools &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in California&lt;/a&gt; still rank in the top 25 most highly attended schools in the country. Within California, these colleges are the largest by population size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UCLA is both the most highly attended California university and the No. 1-ranking public university in America (tied with UC Berkeley), according to the U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report 2024 rankings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of California, Los Angeles, also came in as the seventh-best college for veterans among national universities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It placed ninth out of 100 universities in the Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings, which represents the thoughts of leading, published academics from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/uc-berkeley-parents-hire-private-security-lack-security-campus-amid-continue-area-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; follows at a very close second with 45,699 students enrolled in the fall of 2023. The university tied UCLA for the title of top public school in the U.S. News and World Report&apos;s 2024 American college rankings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine current faculty members hold Nobel Prizes at the University of California, Berkeley, with a total of 35 held by alumni. In addition, 121 Olympic gold medals have been won by UC Berkeley students and alumni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UC San Diego comes in third with a total student population of 43,381 as of fall 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This university has won accolades, including five out of five stars on Money’s Best Colleges in America 2023 list for its quality and affordability, third place among public schools on the Forbes 2023 list of America’s Top Colleges, and sixth-best public university in the U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report 2024 Best Colleges list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school places fourth among American public universities in the 2023 Academic Ranking of World Universities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2023, Cal State Fullerton had a student body of 41,962.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fullerton boasts the No. 1 spot on the Wall Street Journal&apos;s &quot;National Champions of Affordability&quot; bracket for 2021-2022, third place on U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report&apos;s 2021-2022 &quot;most innovative regional university in the West&quot; list, and the Seal of Excelencia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Seal of Excelencia is awarded by a nonprofit called Excelencia in Education whose mission is to accelerate the success of Latinx students in higher education. To earn the seal, the university had to prove it intentionally serves Latinx students, who make up nearly half the school&apos;s student population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UC Davis remains popular, with 40,848 students enrolled in fall 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school is No. 1 in agriculture and forestry, according to the 2021 QS World University Rankings by Subject, as well as No. 1 in veterinary science. It came in sixth place in the U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report 2024 rankings of the best &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/college&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;public colleges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of California, Davis, also raised a record-setting $1.07 billion in research funding for 2021-2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2023, there were 39,530 students enrolled at Long Beach, which was then the most-applied-to school within the California State University system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also earned four and a half out of five stars on Money&apos;s rankings of &quot;The Best Colleges in America 2023.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Beach, as its students call it, was No. 1 among national universities in promoting social mobility, according to the U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A pro-Palestinian student at a private university in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/georgia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Macon, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, was arrested after making physical contact with a conservative speaker delivering a speech on campus about the Israel-Hamas war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mercer University&lt;/a&gt; student Savannah Grace O’Brien was arrested Thursday by campus police on simple battery charges after making physical contact with Atlas Society CEO Jennifer Grossman, who appeared to be speaking in support of Israel, according to WMAZ-TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atlas Society is a conservative nonprofit that promotes the philosophy of author and philosopher Ayn Rand, whose works include Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Brien was booked into the Bibb County Jail on Friday and released on $650 bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-college-president-cracks-down-protesting-pro-palestinian-students-immediate-suspension&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PRESIDENT CRACKS DOWN ON PROTESTING PRO-PALESTINIAN STUDENTS: &apos;IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A video of the incident posted on social media by the Atlas Society showed the student, who was wrapped in pro-Palestinian and transgender flags and wearing a mask, disrupting Grossman’s speech after taking issue with her stance on the Israel-Hamas war and her previous work as senior vice president of fruit and vegetable company Dole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The student approached Grossman at the front of the auditorium and interrupted her speech. The student then criticized Dole&apos;s labor and business practices and put hands on Grossman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A campus police officer was seen escorting the student from the room after the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;America used to be better than this,&quot; the Atlas Society wrote on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pro-palestinian-protest-breaks-out-inside-senate-office-building-interrupts-interview-cease-fire-chants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTEST BREAKS OUT INSIDE SENATE OFFICE BUILDING, INTERRUPTS INTERVIEW WITH CEASE-FIRE CHANTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercer said in a statement that it is reviewing the incident and will take action &quot;as warranted.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Disrupting and invading the personal space of a speaker is not acceptable,&quot; the university said. &quot;It is our hope this will ultimately prove to be a positive learning experience for the student.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speech was held at Mercer University’s Willet Auditorium and was hosted by the university&apos;s chapter of the conservative group Turning Point U.S.A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many pro-Palestinian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-protests&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;protests and disruptions&lt;/a&gt; have happened at U.S. colleges and universities since Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, leading to a retaliatory military response from Israeli forces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>As Americans gear up to celebrate National Beer Day on April 7 with their favorite alcoholic beverage, here are the top five interesting facts about beer.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Beer, a beverage cherished across the globe, holds a special place in the hearts of many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/fox-news-beer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;National Beer Day&lt;/a&gt; is all about honoring the freedom Americans have to enjoy it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the time of Prohibition, consuming beer could be considered a dangerous pursuit because the Constitution banned the sale of alcohol, and officials raided businesses that provided customers with a taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/top-craft-breweries-us-2021&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP CRAFT BREWERIES IN THE US TO VISIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to find out more interesting beer-related facts as we commemorate National Beer Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, National Beer Day has transformed from a quirky tradition into a viral sensation that adults of all different demographics love to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the holiday is very new by today&apos;s standards. The first celebration of National Beer Day took place in April 2009, after local Virginia resident Justin Smith started the day to honor the signing of the Cullen-Harrison Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/easy-drinking-herbal-beer-gruit-inspired-era-ale-aphrodisiac-medicine-hallucinogen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EASY-DRINKING HERBAL BEER GRUIT INSPIRED BY ERA WHEN ALE WAS APHRODISIAC, MEDICINE, HALLUCINOGEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day became a popular trend after Smith and his friends started a Facebook group encouraging other people to honor the day by drinking their favorite beer while partying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beer companies and producers from all around the world now recognize and promote the day to many of their customers. In 2017, the governor of Virginia officially recognized the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Prohibition era in the United States, the selling of beer was outlawed, and the passage of the Volstead Act forbade the production of liquors that contained more than 0.5 percent of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law the Cullen-Harrison Act, which significantly raised the alcohol threshold and led to the legalization of mild beer production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mild beers such as Bud Light, Budweiser and other brands have gone to become one of America&apos;s favorite pastime beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States, for decades, has been a leading and innovative environment for beer manufacturers and a great place to live for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/business-leaders/americas-oldest-brewery-reminds-beer-lovers-story-nobody-else&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;beer lovers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans overwhelmingly favor beer as their favorite form of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affordability and wide array of flavors have distinguished beer as a staple household favorite in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/top-craft-breweries-us-2022&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP-PRODUCING CRAFT BREWERIES IN THE US: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the United States has the second-largest beer market in the world and is one of the top beer consumers per capita in the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people may think of hamburgers, fries and Happy Meals when they think of McDonald&apos;s in the United States, but the American-based fast-food chain serves customers beer in nearly a dozen other countries, including France, Germany, South Korea and Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first McDonald&apos;s chain restaurant to serve beer was founded in 1971 in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This initiative resonated with locals accustomed to beer&apos;s popularity in social settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beer&apos;s rich heritage spans millennia, tracing its origins to ancient civilizations such as Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serving as a cultural cornerstone, beer not only tantalized the taste buds but also played an important role in commerce and social settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who observe National Beer Day, raise a glass in appreciation of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;popular beverage&lt;/a&gt;, recognizing its enduring legacy in connecting people across cultures and generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Phillip Nieto contributed reporting. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Two principals in Texas were charged for allegedly violating state election laws by using their school emails to urge staff to vote for candidates who oppose school vouchers.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two principals in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Texas school district&lt;/a&gt; are facing criminal charges after allegedly violating state election laws by using their school emails to urge staff to vote for candidates who oppose school choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander Elementary School Principal Lindsey Lujan and Borman Elementary Principal Jesus Lujan, who are married, work in the Denton Independent School District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two administrators emailed staff in February encouraging them to vote in March&apos;s Republican primary election for candidates who oppose GOP Gov. Greg Abbott&apos;s school voucher plan, court documents show, according to Fox 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-ag-ken-paxton-sues-school-district-after-principals-accused-violating-election-laws&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEXAS AG KEN PAXTON SUES SCHOOL DISTRICT AFTER PRINCIPALS ACCUSED OF VIOLATING ELECTION LAWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Denton ISD&lt;/a&gt; in response to the emails, which were leaked in February. Paxton&apos;s office and the school district later reached a settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principals were charged with unlawful use of an internal mail system for political advertising, a Class A misdemeanor. The charge carries a maximum penalty of up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas American Federation of Teachers, a teachers union, claimed the charges represent a &quot;politically motivated legal attack.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/texas-university-clears-dei-offices-lays-off-employees-light-new-state-law-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEXAS UNIVERSITY CLEARS DEI OFFICES, LAYS OFF EMPLOYEES IN LIGHT OF NEW STATE LAW: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This latest escalation in the campaign against educators and school employees fulfilling their duty to promote civic engagement and using their voices to highlight the high stakes for public education in our elections threatens to have a profound chilling effect in communities across the state,&quot; Texas AFT said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;election &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;laws &lt;/a&gt;should be followed, but also encouraged people to learn about the candidates and their positions before voting in the primary of their choosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A court hearing for Lindsay Lujan is scheduled for next month while her husband’s hearing is set for June.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Drake Bell says he&apos;s forgiven Rider Strong after letter of support for his abuser: &apos;Healing together&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Drake Bell revealed that he has forgiven Rider Strong. The Nickelodeon star previously called out the &amp;quot;Boy Meets World&amp;quot; alum for supporting Bell&amp;apos;s convicted abuser Brian Peck.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Drake Bell revealed that he has forgiven Rider Strong for his past support of the Nickelodeon star&apos;s convicted abuser, Brian Peck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being convicted of sexually abusing a child in 2004, Peck was sentenced to 16 months in prison and ordered to register as a sex offender. Last month, Bell, now 37, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/drake-bell-claims-sexual-abuse-nickelodeon-convicted-sex-offender&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;publicly identified himself&lt;/a&gt; as the victim in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Bell called out Strong, 44, for being among the actors who wrote letters of support for Peck during the former acting and dialogue coach&apos;s trial.  However, &quot;The Amanda Show&quot; alum shared an update on his relationship with Strong on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I just had the most amazing conversation with @RiderStrong we are all healing together. I have nothing but love and forgiveness for him,&quot; Bell wrote on X, formerly Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell broke his silence in the Investigation Discovery docuseries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/quiet-on-set-directors-say-they-were-clear-with-participants-after-marc-summers-ambush-allegations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; which premiered last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/nickelodeon-star-drake-bell-blasts-boy-meets-world-stars-supporting-abuser-in-past-trial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NICKELODEON STAR DRAKE BELL BLASTS ‘BOY MEETS WORLD’ STARS FOR SUPPORTING ABUSER IN PAST TRIAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The docuseries shared unsealed court documents from Peck’s trial, which contained letters supporting the convicted sex offender from Strong and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/boy-meets-world-star-rider-strong-says-was-very-upset-shows-handling-sex-prom-episode&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Boy Meets World&quot;&lt;/a&gt; co-star Will Friedle as well as other actors including James Marsden, Taran Killam, and the late Alan Thicke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Nikolas, a fellow Nickelodeon child star and participant in the documentary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C4fLmUrOzDl/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;shared a post on Instagram&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; slamming Strong and Friedle, and Bell replied to fans&apos; comments implying they were victims of Peck as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;RIDER WAS 24 years old when he wrote the letter and was told by Brian what he did. He wrote the letter anyway,&quot; Bell wrote in a series of comments that have since been deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate reply, he wrote, &quot;Will was 27 years old and Brian told him what he did many people turned away and said no I won’t write a letter but they did,&quot; Bell wrote. &quot;Will was not manipulated. Brian admitted it to him and he wrote the letter anyway.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then he [Friedle] worked with me on many many episodes of [&apos;Ultimate Spider-Man&apos;] years later and never said a word to me about it,&quot; Bell continued. &quot;This is because they were told there letters are going to be made public. Everyone thought the letters would be sealed forever and no one would ever see them. This is their publicist telling them how to get ahead of the story.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Friedle and Strong &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/boy-meets-world-actors-felt-shame-manipulative-friendship-convicted-child-abuser&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;addressed their support of Peck&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on their podcast, &quot;Pod Meets World,&quot; ahead of the release of details about the &quot;Quiet on Set&quot; documentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&apos;s no way I could have been manipulated like this because I was an adult,&quot; Friedle said. &quot;By the time I had heard what had happened, I had known this man for years and years, had no idea that any of this was going on, obviously, and the idea that now at 24 or whatever I was, 24 or 25 when I found out about it – that I didn&apos;t know, couldn&apos;t spot it – that was a failure of my own.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong remembered Peck admitting to the crime but spinning the assault so that it appeared as though Peck was the victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was always in the context of, ‘I did this thing, I am guilty. I am going to take whatever punishment the government determines, but I’m a victim of jailbait. There was this hot guy. I just did this thing, and he’s underage.’ And we bought that storyline,&quot; Strong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peck was accused of molesting a child in 2003 and was later charged with eight counts of sexual abuse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell was referred to as &quot;John Doe&quot; throughout the investigation and trial. Peck was convicted of a lewd act against a child and oral copulation of a person under the age of 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Elizabeth Stanton contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>WrestleMania 40 Night 2 preview: Cody Rhodes clashes with Roman Reigns for WWE Undisputed Universal Title</title>
                    
                    <description>Cody Rhodes will look to finish history on Sunday on the second night of WrestleMania 40 as he takes on Roman Reigns for the WWE Undisputed Universal Championship.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/wwe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WrestleMania Night 2&lt;/a&gt; is on deck after an electrifying Night 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was epic to say the least. Roman Reigns and The Rock were the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/wwe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;big winners of Night 1&lt;/a&gt;, scoring a victory over Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reigns will set the record for most WrestleMania main events in history. But it will be far from the only major match on the card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what fans can expect on Night 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s Bloodline Rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After The Rock and Roman Reigns topped Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins on Night 1, the WWE Undisputed Universal Championship match will be under Bloodline Rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was far from an easy match. The four competitors were in a slobberknocker all-out fight. Rhodes put The Rock through the announce table. Reigns speared Rollins and injured his knee during the match. Scars were left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It won’t be easy for Reigns or Rhodes. Both were beaten and battered. Reigns will have The Bloodline in his corner while Rhodes might have to find someone who isn’t bruised to help keep Reigns’ family at bay come Sunday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seth Rollins will already be coming off of a grueling tag-team match with Rhodes against Reigns and The Rock. He is a little bit more hurt than he would have liked to be going up against a behemoth like Drew McIntyre. Rollins tweaked his knee during his loss against Reigns and The Rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McIntyre has been on Rollins’ case for weeks. With some help, he came through to win the Elimination Chamber to get a shot at Rollins’ World Heavyweight Championship, which &quot;The Visionary&quot; has held since it was revealed to be Raw’s top crown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With CM Punk likely to be at ringside to call the match, McIntyre’s focus could be elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WWE gold has eluded McIntyre since he lost to Reigns at Clash at the Castle in 2022 and then the Intercontinental Championship at WrestleMania 39. Could he leave Philly with Rollins’ title on Sunday?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayley founded Damage CTRL and helped Iyo Sky cash in her Money in the Bank briefcase at SummerSlam to win the title from Bianca Belair. Sky has been the champion ever since. But after Bayley won the Royal Rumble match, everything changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sky, Asuka and Kairi Sane turned on Bayley. Just when Bayley thought she had a friend in Dakota Kai, she turned on her too. Bayley seems to be on her own as she goes up against Sky in the biggest match of her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayley could become a three-time SmackDown Women’s Champion if she manages to defeat Sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nick-khan-ushers-wwes-renaissance-era-support-cody-rhodes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NICK KHAN USHERS IN WWE&apos;S &apos;RENAISSANCE ERA&apos; WITH SUPPORT FROM CODY RHODES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At WrestleMania 39, Logan Paul lost to Rollins to put an end to their feud. Kevin Owens won the Undisputed Tag Team Championship with Sami Zayn over The Usos. Randy Orton was still recovering from a serious back injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul defeated Rey Mysterio to win the U.S. title and nearly earned a shot at Rollins’ title in the Elimination Chamber back in February. He ended up costing Orton a chance at the belt. At the Royal Rumble, Paul cheated to defeat Owens to retain his title, causing a clear grievance with him as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis pit the three up against each other in a three-way match for the title. It will be one of the more interesting matches on the card between the two nights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LA Knight has a summer emergence. Behind a wave of fan support, he turned a feud against The Miz and set his sights on Reigns and the WWE Undisputed Universal Championship. If it wasn’t for The Bloodline, he may have been in the main event at this year’s ‘Mania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, he found himself the target of a revenge plot by Styles. The &quot;Phenomenal One&quot; attacked Knight for taking his spot in a tag-team match at Fastlane which saw Knight and John Cena take out Jimmy Uso and Solo Sikoa. The Bloodline had put Styles on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Styles came back in December and immediately had it out for Knight. The two participated in a fatal four way for the Undisputed Universal Championship at the Royal Rumble but Reigns retained. Styles then cost Knight a title shot in the Elimination Chamber match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knight and Styles were also in an angle in which they brawled on Styles’ front lawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all led to the match on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the final matches set on the WrestleMania card was a 6-man tag-team Philadelphia street fight match between The Pride, consisting of Bobby Lashley, Montez Ford and Angelo Dawkins against The Final Testament, consisting of Karrion Kross, Akam and Rezer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akam and Rezer, known as the Authors of Pain, returned WWE at the beginning of the year and backed Kross in his crusade against The Pride. The two groups have feuded since then with The Final Testament attacking Bobby Lashley and his valet B-Fab while Ford and Dawkins were trying to earn a shot at the 6-pack ladder match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grayson Waller and Austin Theory took advantage and defeated Ford and Dawkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The street fight was announced soon after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>The Rock and Roman Reigns took care of business against Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins on Saturday night at WrestleMania 40. Reigns and Rhodes will face off Sunday night.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Roman Reigns and The Rock reminded Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins just how steep the mountain was to get to the top of the WWE at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/wwe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WrestleMania 40&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/dwayne-the-rock-johnson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Rock&lt;/a&gt; pinned Rhodes after an acknowledgment to The Bloodline and some trash talk to Rhodes’ mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was far from an easy match for The Bloodline. It turned into an all-out slobberknocker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The match had stakes for Night 2. If Reigns and The Rock won, the WWE Undisputed Universal Championship match will be contested under Bloodline Rules. If Rhodes and Rollins won, then the match would be free of any members of The Bloodline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After dramatic entrances, Reigns and Rollins locked up to start the match. Rhodes also locked up with Reigns for a few moments before The Rock was tagged in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rock, making his first appearance in a WWE ring in eight years, went head-to-head with Rollins. The Rock hit Rollins with a clothesline and called on Rhodes to get into the ring. Rhodes tagged in and it was on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhodes and Rollins had the upper hand early, teaming up to keep The Rock and Reigns down. The two teams stared each other down and the brawl got underway. Rhodes zeroing in on Reigns and Rocky facing an assault from Rollins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nxt-stand-deliver-2024-trick-williams-ends-carmelo-hayes-feud-roxanne-perez-regains-championship&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NXT STAND &amp;amp; DELIVER 2024: TRICK WILLIAMS ENDS CARMELO HAYES FEUD; ROXANNE PEREZ REGAINS CHAMPIONSHIP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brawl between The Rock and Rollins went into the stands. The Rock threatened to fire the referee if he tried to count them out. Meanwhile, Rhodes worked on Reigns near the top of the entryway. Rollins thought he had the match in the palm of his hand against The Rock but Reigns came out of nowhere and took out Rollins’ knee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rock went to work on Rollins’ knee as it appeared &quot;The Visionary&quot; was truly in pain. Reigns was tagged in to continue what his partner started. The Bloodline members were in control of Rollins for a while – not only targeting the knee but also Rollins’ bad back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reigns stalked Rollins for a Superman Punch but Rollins countered with a neckbreaker. The Rock was tagged in and he prevented Rollins from doing the same. But Rollins finally caught a break with a step-up enziguri. Just when Rollins tried to tag out, Reigns hit Rhodes and knocked him off the apron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rock put Rollins into the sharpshooter. Rhodes came out of nowhere and slapped The Rock. Rollins took advantage and hit The Stomp. Rollins finally got to Rhodes and The Rock got to Reigns. Rhodes started to build momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/wwe-star-cody-rhodes-talks-preparation-wrestlemania-40-hes-set-main-event-both-nights&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WWE STAR CODY RHODES TALKS PREPARATION FOR WRESTLEMANIA 40 AS HE&apos;S SET TO MAIN EVENT BOTH NIGHTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reigns stopped the momentum with a Superman Punch just as Rhodes was going for another Cody Cutter. Reigns was busted open – a rare sight for a champion who has been so dominant over the last few years. He tried for the spear but it was missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rollins nearly had a pinfall on Reigns after a tag-in and then a splash. Reigns kicked out. Rhodes and Rollins hit superkicks on Reigns and seemed to be in control. Rhodes hit the Cross Rhodes but as the ref was about to count to three, The Rock pulled the referee out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Final Boss&quot; was swinging his power around and The Bloodline took advantage. Reigns speared Rhodes but he kicked out of a pin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rock was ready for the People’s Elbow but it was met by a Cody Cutter. Rhodes tried to go for the Cross Rhodes. But Reigns hit the Superman Punch to save The Rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reigns had Rhodes dead to rights with a spear setup. But Rollins pushed Rhodes out of the way and Reigns hit The Rock with a spear. Rhodes and Rollins hit simultaneous Pedigrees on their competitors – 1, 2, almost 3. The crowd was stunned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The match went back outside the ring. The Rock took Rhodes to the announce tables. Rhodes hit the Rock Bottom through the announce table. Then, Reigns speared Rollins through the barricade. Reigns and Rhodes kept going.

                    <title>Jewish students at Rutgers speak out in wake of latest anti-Israel incident on campus: &apos;Horrifying experience&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Jewish students at Rutgers University are speaking out after the latest incidents of antisemitism on campus, including a student whose face was plastered on a pro-Palestinian flyer.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A group of &quot;out of control&quot; pro-Palestinian protesters interrupted a town hall at Rutgers University on Thursday, shouting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/anti-semitism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;anti-Israel&lt;/a&gt; slogans like &quot;one solution, intifada revolution&quot; and forcing officials to end the meeting early as they and Jewish students were ushered out by police, a student told Fox News Digital this weekend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The student, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, said Rutgers President Jonathan Holloway and administrators &quot;ran away,&quot; &quot;leaving behind the Jewish/pro-Israel students to deal with an unruly and obviously antisemitic crowd, whose attention turned to the Jews after the administration left.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said police then ushered students out the back door because it was too dangerous to exit the front door. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cory Rothbort, an attorney with Mazie Slater &amp;amp; Freeman, who is representing student Rivka Schafer along with another student, called it a &quot;horrifying experience&quot; for the Jews in attendance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/vanderbilt-students-arrested-suspended-rowdy-protest-over-anti-israel-ballot-initiative&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VANDERBILT STUDENTS ARRESTED, SUSPENDED AT ROWDY PROTEST OVER ANTI-ISRAEL BALLOT INITIATIVE &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rothbort said the Jewish students had gone to the town hall to &quot;get some answers from President Holloway, they wanted to know what he was going to do to help protect them on campus, and instead they were met with the very same conduct that they were looking for protection from.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video Schafer took of the town hall shows pro-Palestinian protesters begin chanting after Holloway said the school will not be severing ties with Tel Aviv University, a school with which it has a relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rothbort said the town hall was hosted by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rutgers University Student Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, which had also put two BDS referendums up for a vote on severing ties with Tel Aviv University and divesting from anything connected to Israel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/anti-semitism-bds-movement-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;BDS is a Pro-Palestinian movement&lt;/a&gt; that stands for &quot;boycott, divest and sanction&quot; and &quot;it is targeted solely at the one and only Jewish state of Israel,&quot; Rothbort told Fox News Digital. &quot;It is meant to economically isolate and basically discriminate against the Jewish state.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said numerous states, including New Jersey, have adopted anti-BDS legislation that state the &quot;government will not finance or provide pension money or do business with any company that promotes or supports BDS.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/london-police-officer-sparks-outrage-after-suggesting-swastikas-should-taken-context-jewish-woman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LONDON POLICE OFFICER SPARKS OUTRAGE AFTER SUGGESTING SWASTIKAS SHOULD BE ‘TAKEN INTO CONTEXT’ TO JEWISH WOMAN &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rothbort said that Rutgers’ administration was told that a BDS referendum could &quot;inflame antisemitic conduct,&quot; but &quot;Rutgers said they weren’t going to do anything.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Gindi, another Jewish student who attended the town hall, told Fox News Digital, &quot;It’s been a tough couple of months since Oct. 7 at Rutgers. I was not prepared for a protest. No Jewish students brought banners or flags, no Jewish students shouted or anything or disrupted the event. We were just there to hear a town hall.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he has experienced previous incidences of antisemitism and even testified in front of the House Committee on Education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said RUSA&apos;s referendums &quot;stirred the pot in a way that we just haven’t seen at Rutgers. The number of incidents, the scale of some of these incidents is just unfathomable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holloway emailed students defending the decision not to shut down the referendum, Rothbort said. &quot;In it, he cites one of the reasons: he says I basically trust student government, and two, I expect students to engage in responsible civic practice.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the meeting, Rothbort said Schafer was also targeted by pro-Palestinian students at her dorm the same week the BDS referendum went up for a vote. When she woke up one morning to find flyers, &quot;put up outside her room and throughout her entire dormitory on every floor of her face and pro-Palestinian language connected to the BDS referendum.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She filed a report with the Rutgers University Police Department, but told the New York Post she felt &quot;completely unsafe&quot; and &quot;targeted&quot; for her religious beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was very clear they were targeting her right where she sleeps, and it was an intimidation tactic, a message to both Jewish students, as well as Rivka, that ‘Don’t support Israel, we know where you sleep,’&quot; Rothbort said. &quot;That is the definition of a biased conduct, and so I’ve been helping Rivka navigate those waters.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gindi called Schafer&apos;s flayer incident a &quot;level of intimidation that it’s sickening We haven’t had anything like that at least at Rutgers before.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the incident, Schafer went to the town hall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rivka is a very brave individual and Rivka was not going to allow these individuals keep her quiet and suppress her ability to support Israel,&quot; he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rothbort said he had learned from students that much of the antisemitic behavior isn’t out in the open, but rather through &quot;typical school bullying behavior&quot; such as group chats through text, WhatsApp, or other online messaging applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Schafer was in a chess group chat one time &quot;and all of a sudden, the president of the chess group shared some messages out of the blue basically saying boycott Israel, don’t let your tuition money go to murderers or genocide.&quot; He said Schafer told him, Now I can’t participate in chess club, I’m not welcome here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there have been other antisemitic incidents on campus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/viral-columbia-professor-called-campus-antisemitism-says-university-investigating-him-retaliation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLUMBIA PROF WHO CALLED OUT CAMPUS ANTISEMITISM SAYS SCHOOL INVESTIGATING HIM &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How can you have a culture where chanting for a one-state solution is acceptable? How can you have a culture where chanting to globalize the intifada or long live the intifada or there is only one solution, intifada revolution? I mean that is antisemitic that is targeting Jewish people,&quot; Rothbort said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Rutgers has defended its &quot;inaction&quot; on &quot;First Amendment grounds and saying you have a right to say what you want to say. Well, that’s not true. The First Amendment doesn’t protect all sorts of speech, and it doesn’t protect all sorts of conduct. It doesn’t protect speech that incites violence, and it doesn’t protect hateful conduct.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schafer hasn’t made the decision to sue the school yet. &quot;We’re evaluating our options and there’s an ongoing criminal investigation,&quot; Rothbort explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rutgers and other colleges &quot;can’t keep putting their head in the sand and say, ‘Well, we can’t do anything about it,’ citing First Amendment rights,&quot; Rothbort said. &quot;You have an obligation and a legal obligation to prevent your students from being bullied, intimidated, harassed and discriminated against because of their religion or other characteristics.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gindi said that while most people left the town hall through the emergency exits, &quot;I actually refused to go with the majority of the group. I refused to let these bullies intimidate me to the point where I had to leave through the emergency exit, so I refused, I went through the main exits at my own leisure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that he is &quot;grateful&quot; to Holloway for &quot;really sticking up and defending the university’s relationship with Tel Aviv University and calling out the horribleness of BDS. I have so much respect for him for that and I really, really thank him for standing with the Jewish community at least in this regard.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rutgers told Fox News Digital in a statement about the town hall incident: &quot;Students who objected to President Holloway’s belief that the BDS movement is both wrong and counter-productive and who disagree with his support for continuing Rutgers’ partnership with Tel Aviv University disrupted a meeting of the Rutgers University Student Assembly (RUSA) where the president was discussing topics of interest to RUSA.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The RUSA leaders ended the meeting and President Holloway, with his driver who is a Rutgers University police officer, and other attendees left the meeting without incident.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 1, Holloway said in a statement: &quot;On the question of divestment, I think the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement is wrong. I believe in engagement, not isolation. I believe that enlightenment comes from involvement and that lasting progress and peace are the outcomes of diplomacy and discussion. Please also know that the University’s Joint Committee on Investments has authority over investment policy. A request for divestment from companies doing business in Israel was presented to that committee in 2020, and it did not move forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our partnership with TAU adds to our fundamental academic and research mission. This relationship was first established in 2016 and will continue at the HELIX, our new research facility in downtown New Brunswick. I traveled to Tel Aviv in 2021 with a delegation from New Jersey to renew the memorandum establishing the partnership and to show my commitment to global academic exchanges and to international engagement. Rutgers has relationships like this with universities all over the world, and they help move our mission forward.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Sami Zayn upset Gunther to win the Intercontinental Championship Saturday night at WrestleMania 40. Gunther had held the title 666 days.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sami Zayn was the Rocky Balboa to Gunther’s Ivan Drago Saturday night at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/wwe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WrestleMania 40&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After taking a beating in the middle of the ring, Zayn came almost out of nowhere and stunned &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/gunther-intercontinental-championship-reign-stays-intact-with-win-at-wrestlemania-39&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Ring General&lt;/a&gt;&quot; multiple times. He didn’t give up despite taking chop after chop to the chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He left Philadelphia as the new Intercontinental Champion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gunther entered the match with a reign of nearly 670 days, the longest in history. For most of the early part of the match, Gunther was in control with chop after chop after chop to Zayn’s chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zayn showed he could withstand the slaps and the chops. He had a moment to gain the upper hand, kicking Gunther’s arm to avoid another chop and hit a half-and-half suplex. Gunther stayed on the attack, though, hitting a brutal clothesline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zayn showed his resiliency with a slap to the face and a tornado DDT off of the ropes. A helluva kick and blue thunder bomb were both countered. Gunther put Zayn into a sleeper hold. Gunther prevented Zayn from reaching the ropes and his a German suplex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zayn, for a split second, thought he was going to take control but missed on an exploder. Gunther got the advantage back and hit a powerbomb. But Zayn kicked out of the pin. Gunther had Zayn in the corner and painted him with his own boot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A burst of energy hit Zayn. He threw &quot;The Ring General&quot; into the corner and hit the helluva kick. Gunther showed his own ring prowess and caught Zayn again with two powerbombs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/wrestlemania-40-eagles-greats-jason-kelce-lane-johnson-help-rey-mysterio-and-andrade-win-match&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WRESTLEMANIA 40: EAGLES GREATS JASON KELCE, LANE JOHNSON HELP REY MYSTERIO AND ANDRADE WIN MATCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gunther was left in disbelief after Zayn kicked out of the pin. He continued to trash talk Zayn’s wife, who was seated at ringside, and he continued the attack. It was clear the reigning champion was frustrated and thought the match should be over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After another powerbomb and multiple splashes, Zayn wouldn’t give up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zayn got up and hit another helluva kick on Gunther. He hit a wild brainbuster on Gunther. One more helluva kick put Gunther on his back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zayn covered Gunther for the pin, and the crowd went wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 666-day reign of Gunther came to an end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the second year in a row Zayn walks away from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/pro-wrestling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WrestleMania with gold&lt;/a&gt;.

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A model has denied accusations that she was one of Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs&apos; sex workers after being named in a sexual assault lawsuit filed by a male music producer against the rapper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodney &quot;Lil Rod&quot; Jones Jr., a producer on Combs&apos; latest studio album, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/music&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Love Album: Off the Grid,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot; alleged the Bad Boy Records founder &quot;bragged about having several women on a monthly stipend.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones claimed that Instagram model Jade Ramey was one of three women who were &quot;paid a monthly fee to work as Mr. Combs&apos; sex workers,&quot; according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, I dated someone. Dating someone doesn&apos;t directly correlate to any of the false allegations made,&quot; Ramey told Entertainment Tonight in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/diddy-federal-investigation-sparks-interest-famous-friends-interviews-resurface-a-lot-i-cant-tell&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DIDDY FEDERAL INVESTIGATION SPARKS INTEREST IN FAMOUS FRIENDS, INTERVIEWS RESURFACE: ‘A LOT I CAN’T TELL&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued, &quot;How unfortunate we&apos;ve entered a time where caring for someone or falling in love is worthy of scrutiny in the court of public opinion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What may be amusing for you is real life for others, and my feelings have never been for entertainment, nor are they up for discussion,&quot; Ramey added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We need to be more conscious as a society when ridiculing people’s lives and relationships merely for enjoyment. I appreciate everyone’s kind messages and support during this time.

Last month, Joy, who was photographed with Combs in Miami Beach in 2021, refuted the claims on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am deeply hurt by the lies in Rodney Jones&apos; lawsuit. The claim that I am a sex worker is 100% false and character assassination,&quot; Joy wrote in a statement shared on her Instagram Story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

That filing came weeks after Combs settled a separate lawsuit with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-settles-lawsuit-one-day-after-ex-girlfriend-cassies-allegations-years-rape&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ex-girlfriend, Cassie&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who accused him of rape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, Jones alleged that the rapper had sexually assaulted him and forced him to perform sex acts with prostitutes. He accused Combs of unsolicited groping and sexual touching of his anus on multiple occasions and also described several scenarios of inappropriate work conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the filing, Combs&apos; lawyer disputed Jones&apos; claims, calling them &quot;pure fiction&quot; in a statement shared with Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C5Eog2nSdqy/?hl=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;APP USERS CLICK HERE TO VIEW POST&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lil Rod is nothing more than a liar who filed a $30 million lawsuit shamelessly looking for an undeserved payday. His reckless name-dropping about events that are pure fiction and simply did not happen is nothing more than a transparent attempt to garner headlines,&quot; attorney Shawn Holley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have overwhelming, indisputable proof that his claims are complete lies. Our attempts to share this proof with Mr. Jones’ attorney, Tyrone Blackburn, have been ignored, as Mr. Blackburn refuses to return our calls. We will address these outlandish allegations in court and take all appropriate action against those who make them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-ex-cassie-likely-important-witness-homeland-security-trafficking-probe-expert&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Homeland Security raided&lt;/a&gt; Combs&apos; properties in Miami Beach and Los Angeles. During the raids, Combs&apos; phones were seized, sources told NBC News. Authorities also allegedly took possession of firearms from Combs&apos; homes, the outlet reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. official previously confirmed to Fox News the raids were connected to a federal human trafficking investigation, although it&apos;s unclear if Combs is the target of the federal agents&apos; investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comb&apos;s attorney, Aaron Dyer, later issued a statement denouncing the raid as a &quot;witch hunt.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yesterday, there was a gross overuse of military-level force as search warrants were executed at Mr. Combs’ residences. There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated. Mr. Combs was never detained but spoke to and cooperated with authorities. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Despite media speculation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, neither Mr. Combs nor any of his family members have been arrested nor has their ability to travel been restricted in any way,&quot; Dyer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This unprecedented ambush — paired with an advanced, coordinated media presence — leads to a premature rush to judgment of Mr. Combs and is nothing more than a witch hunt based on meritless accusations made in civil lawsuits. There has been no finding of criminal or civil liability with any of these allegations. Mr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Combs appeared carefree as he was photographed biking around Miami Beach before returning to his home in the exclusive Star Island community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Caroline Thayer contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Yoko Ono says she introduced late husband John Lennon to heroin in a new oral history book on the Beatles filled with interviews from 1980-1981.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Yoko Ono says in a new book on the Beatles that includes never-before-heard interviews from the 1980s that she introduced then-husband John Lennon to heroin, telling him she experienced a &quot;beautiful feeling&quot; on the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ono, 91, denied in the interview that she &quot;put John on H,&quot; according to excerpts from &quot;All You Need Is Love: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/beatles-releasing-final-song-now-and-then-john-lennon-vocals-quite-emotional-paul-mccartney&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Beatles&lt;/a&gt; in Their Own Words&quot;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;released by The Sunday Times, adding that the Beatles member &quot;wouldn’t take anything unless he wanted to do it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book also includes interviews with band members Paul McCartney, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ringo-starr-beatles-rapid-rise-fame-we-all-went-mad-different-times&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ringo Starr,&lt;/a&gt; George Harrison as well as their families and business associates conducted by Peter Brown, COO of Apple Corp, the Beatles&apos; financial empire, and Steven Gaines in 1980 and 1981. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lennon was&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/beatles-legend-john-lennon-assassinated-43-years-ago-what-to-know&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; assassinated in 1980.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/paul-mccartney-beatles-allowed-yoko-ono-nonconfrontational-deference-john&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAUL MCCARTNEY SAYS BEATLES ALLOWED YOKO ONO TO DO THIS DUE TO BEING NONCONFRONTATIONAL, ‘DEFERENCE’ TO JOHN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Only a small portion of the contents of these transcribed interviews have ever been revealed,&quot; a synopsis of the book says. &quot;The interviews are unique and candid. The information, stories, and experiences, and the authority of the people who relate to them, have historic value. No collection like this can ever be assembled again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

So I told John that.&apos;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an Interview with Rolling Stone published in January 1971, Lennon said heroin &quot;just was not too much fun,&quot; adding that they only &quot;sniffed a little when we were in real pain.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/paul-mccartney-captures-beatles-rise-fame-photos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PAUL MCCARTNEY CAPTURES THE BEATLES&apos; INNOCENCE,&apos; CHALLENGES AMID RISE TO FAME IN NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN PHOTOS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both he and Ono said they never &quot;injected it.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We got such a hard time from everyone, and I’ve had so much thrown at me, and at Yoko, especially at Yoko,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;Like Peter Brown in our office – and you can put this in – after we come in after six months he comes down and shakes my hand and doesn’t even say hello to her. That’s going on all the time. And we get into so much pain that we have to do something about it. And that’s what happened to us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/beatles-john-lennon-shocked-paul-mccartney-concern-legacy-after-death&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEATLES&apos; JOHN LENNON ‘SHOCKED&apos; PAUL MCCARTNEY WITH CONCERN OVER LEGACY AFTER DEATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the couple did heroin &quot;because of what the Beatles and others were doing to us.

                    <description>Former President Donald Trump’s GOP fundraiser in Palm Beach, Florida, rakes in more than $50 million</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former President &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s campaign team says it raised more than $50 million at a Saturday evening’s GOP fundraiser in Palm Beach, Florida, smashing records for a Republican or Democratic candidate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It took three Democrat presidents to raise $25 million and one president to raise over $50 million, Donald J. Trump,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/campaigning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;campaign spokesperson&lt;/a&gt; Danielle Alvarez boasted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday’s fundraiser took place at a private home in Palm Beach, hosted by billionaire and hedge fund founder John Paulson. Among the 100 or so guests will be heavy-hitters like casino mogul Steve Wynn, Bigelow Aerospace Founder and President Robert Bigelow, and former U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The response to our fundraising efforts has been overwhelming, and we&apos;ve raised over $43 million so far,&quot; Paulson said in a statement. &quot;There is massive support amongst a broad spectrum of donors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking briefly to reporters as he arrived at the event with his wife, Melania Trump, the former president said, &quot;this has been some incredible evening before it even starts because people – they wanted to contribute to a cause of making America great again, and that&apos;s waht&apos;s happened.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the fundraiser is expected to take in tens of millions, Trump still needs to close the gap with his Democratic rival, incumbent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt;, who is reported to have around $192 million on hand compared with just over $93 million for Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden’s campaign said he raised more than $26 million during a fundraising appearance late last month at New York City’s famed Radio City Music Hall with former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aclu-threatens-sue-georgia-election-bill-conservatives-praise-commonsense-reform&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACLU THREATENS TO SUE GEORGIA OVER ELECTION BILL CONSERVATIVES PRAISE AS ‘COMMONSENSE’ REFORM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;re-election campaign&lt;/a&gt; called the money raised at the star-studded event — which set a record for a single fundraiser — &quot;historic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s event, billed as the &quot;Inaugural Leadership Dinner,&quot; sends a signal of a resurgence for the former president and Republican Party fundraising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump initially struggled to attract big donors when he launched his campaign and some lined up to support the other Republicans who challenged him in the presidential primary. But as Trump racked up easy wins, leveled the field and became the party&apos;s presumptive nominee, the GOP has solidified behind him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributions to the event will go toward the Trump 47 Committee, according to the invitation, a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee, state Republican parties and Save America, a political action committee that pays the bulk of Trump&apos;s legal bills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an unusual arrangement, the fundraising agreement directs donations to first pay the maximum allowed under law to his campaign and Save America before the RNC or state parties get a cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guests are asked to contribute $814,600 per person as a &quot;chairman&quot; contributor, which comes with seating at Trump&apos;s table, or $250,000 per person as a &quot;host committee&quot; contributor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both options come with a photo opportunity and a personalized copy of Trump&apos;s coffee table book featuring photographs from his administration, &quot;Our Journey Together.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of Trump&apos;s former rivals for the GOP nomination — South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy — are expected to appear as &quot;special guests.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Every fiber in my body hurts. Josh fought every single day for most of his adult life, for his life, but this past Sunday, the challenge was too great.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/real-housewives-star-gretchen-rossi-stepson-grayson-dead-22-brain-cancer-battle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘REAL HOUSEWIVES’ STAR GRETCHEN ROSSI&apos;S STEPSON GRAYSON DEAD AT 22 AFTER BRAIN CANCER BATTLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Josh’s childhood was filled with deep intellect, humor, pranks, athletics, snow boarding, body boarding mountain hikes, reading, friends and his love for music. Even during adult hardship, Josh continued to maintain his sense of humor, continued to be optimistic, continued to be kind to others, defended those that were unable to defend themselves and continued to love his family so so much!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peterson reflected on the special relationship that Waring shared with his daughter Kennady, writing that he &quot;received the most joy, pride and purpose&quot; through his child and watching her &quot;grow and thrive over the years.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also expressed her gratitude to those who had offered their help and support to Waring, who struggled with&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/drug-and-substance-abuse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; substance abuse. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C5bXcQwxQ9i/?img_index=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APP USERS CLICK HERE TO VIEW POST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thank you to all of the people that have tried to help Josh along the way,&quot; Peterson wrote. &quot;I am witness to many Angels on earth. Not everyone understands those suffering from substance abuse disorder, but I am forever grateful for your understanding and the impact you made on his life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I also thank those who have supported me through this journey and offering kind words of encouragement by sharing their stories of living with substance abuse disorder and the many parents that have shared their stories over the years with me about the children they have sadly lost due to this illness,&quot; she continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Josh I love you so much and I will miss you terribly! I will forever be your &quot;Mama Bear &amp;amp; Mama Dukes&quot; and every time the clock turns to 11:11, I will expect your call to tell me to make a wish! What will I wish for now?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My heart is with you and I pray you have found the peace that you so deserve. Heaven has gained the coolest angel and you have gained your freedom at last sweet boy. Love always and forever, Mom,&quot; Peterson wrote at the end of her post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital has reached out to Peterson for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peterson shared Waring with her ex-husband Phillip Waring and the two are also parents to daughter Sophia. The former model also shares daughter Ashley with her ex-husband Howard Zarlin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the finale of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/shows/the-real-housewives&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;The Real Housewives of Orange County&apos;s&quot; &lt;/a&gt;third season, the former reality star married George Peterson. Peterson was a member of the show&apos;s original cast, starring alongside Kimberly Bryant, Jo De La Rosa, Vicki Gunvalson and Jeana Keough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peterson was a regular cast member during the series&apos; first four seasons from 2006 to 2008. She returned for guest appearances in later seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Peterson announced her son&apos;s passing on Instagram, her post was flooded with supportive comments from her former co-stars and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh Laurie, my heart breaks for you so much. I know how much you fought for him and always wanted nothing but the best for him,&quot; ‘RHOC’ alum &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/real-housewives-of-orange-county-alum-gretchen-rossi-reveals-shes-having-a-daughter-with-slade-smiley&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Gretchen Rossi &lt;/a&gt;wrote, adding a red heart emoji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rossi continued, &quot;May the Lord surround you with his angels and give you strength through this incredibly hard loss. I love you friend.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My heart breaks for you, i know how hard you worked to be his advocate . Big hug and prayers for your family at this sad time,&quot; Peterson&apos;s former cast-mate Keough commented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lauri I am so sorry. This is heartbreaking. You tried so hard to save him, and by sharing Josh’s story you would up educating people around the world about the tragedy of addiction for those who are touched by it,&quot; &quot;Real Housewives&quot; executive producer Andy Cohen wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Remember he was so lucky to have a mom who never gave up. RIP,&quot; former &quot;RHOC&quot; star Heather McDonald commented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m so incredibly sorry, Lauri,&quot; wrote De La Rosa. &quot;Sending you all my love and praying for your heart. Here if you need anything.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Peterson told the Orange County Register that she decided to leave the show to focus on her family amid Waring&apos;s struggles with addiction and legal woes. Peterson and George adopted Waring&apos;s daughter Kennady in 2015, the former reality star previously told Bravo&apos;s &quot;The Daily Dish.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Waring took a plea deal after spending &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/real-housewives-lauri-peterson-josh-waring-jailhouse-fight&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;four years in prison&lt;/a&gt; for attempted murder following a 2016 arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-me-waring-20171020-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Waring was arrested in June 2016 after he allegedly shot a man in Costa Mesa, California, and then engaged in a car chase with authorities. He initially pleaded not guilty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Waring was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to drug charges, per the LA Times. Waring had been found in possession of fentanyl and methamphetamine, according to the outlet. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

On Saturday, they were called upon to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelce and Johnson got involved in Rey Mysterio and Andrade’s match against Dominik Mysterio and Santos Escobar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two burly men came through the crowd wearing Eagles masks and interfered in the tag-team match, helping out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/wwe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WWE Hall of Famer&lt;/a&gt; and Andrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelce pushed Dominik Mysterio into the ring post after Johnson took a chair away. Kelce then threw Dominik Mysterio into the ring, and Rey Mysterio and Andrade took advantage. Santos Escobar was caught off guard and was attacked by Andrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rey Mysterio and Andrade picked up the win. Kelce and Johnson joined them and the rest of the LWO inside the ring to celebrate the victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/wrestlemania-40-rhea-ripley-tops-becky-lynch-hotly-contested-match-retain-womens-title&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WRESTLEMANIA 40: RHEA RIPLEY TOPS BECKY LYNCH IN HOTLY CONTESTED MATCH TO RETAIN WOMEN&apos;S TITLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelce announced his retirement from the NFL last month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He played in 193 games in his NFL career, second most in team history. He made 156 consecutive starts, a franchise record, and was a seven-time Pro Bowler and six-time All-Pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was rumored the former center would be involved in WrestleMania in some role since it is happening at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt; star George Kittle joined the fray and clotheslined The Miz.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Vanderbilt students expelled, suspended for participation in unruly pro-Palestinian protests</title>
                    
                    <description>Vanderbilt University students have been expelled, one has been suspended, and more than 20 have been placed on probation after last month’s rowdy pro-Palestinian demonstrations and sit-in.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several Vanderbilt University students have been expelled, one has been suspended, and more than 20 have been placed on probation after last month’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/vanderbilt-students-arrested-suspended-rowdy-protest-over-anti-israel-ballot-initiative&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;rowdy demonstration&lt;/a&gt; protesting the administration’s removal of the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) initiative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s according to the Vanderbilt Divest Coalition (VDC), the group which put forth an amendment to the Vanderbilt Student Government Constitution that would prevent government funds from going to certain businesses that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;support Israel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed amendment collected more than 600 signatures and qualified for a student ballot, but was removed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/college&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the university&lt;/a&gt;, prompting nearly 30 students to march into the halls of Vanderbilt Chancellor Daniel Diermeier’s office to hold a sit-in on March 26.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university has alleged that some students physically assaulted a Community Service Officer (CSO) to gain entrance and pushed staff members. VDC has described the protest as &quot;peaceful.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Nashville Scene reporter was also detained outside the building after repeatedly attempting to enter several doors of the administrative building, Kirkland Hall, before being asked to leave.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sit-in protest lasted more than 20 hours. More than 30 additional students were on the steps outside the building protesting for hours even though they faced threats of suspension and forced removal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/fox-news-antisemitism-exposed-newsletter-pro-palestinian-protests-targeting-houses-of-worship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTS TARGETING HOUSES OF WORSHIP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, VDC said that three students had been expelled, one student had been suspended, and more than 20 were on &quot;disciplinary probation for peacefully protesting for Palestine.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group accused Chancellor Diermeier of being &quot;notoriously cruel to student protesters.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All students are going through the appeal process to rectify these grossly oppressive decisions from administration. We only had one ask: let us vote,&quot; VDC said in a social media post, before calling on other students to join them in a walkout on Monday at noon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university declined to confirm the group’s numbers on expulsions and suspensions, citing federal privacy laws. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;After a thorough review of the incident, including examination of evidence and interviews with students, the Student Accountability Community Standards and Academic Integrity staff issued a range of findings and sanctions that took the individual circumstances of each student’s conduct into account,&quot; Vanderbilt Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs C. Cybele Raver said Friday. &quot;The sanctions included disciplinary probation as well as suspension and expulsion.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students have 10 days to appeal their case to the university’s Appellate Review Board. During the appeal process, students will be able to return to classes. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Colorado&apos;s Deion Sanders issues stern warning after learning of players&apos; lackadaisical approach to academics</title>
                    
                    <description>Deion Sanders wants Colorado to be ready for the football season, but he also wants his players to understand the important role education plays in their lives after football.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Deion Sanders-led &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/colorado-buffaloes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Colorado Buffaloes&lt;/a&gt; took the college football world by storm last season. The Buffaloes had a disappointing finish to the season but have added several notable players to the roster over the past few months and will enter the 2024 campaign with high expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Sanders is working to make sure the team is fully prepared for the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-fb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;football season&lt;/a&gt;, he also wants to ensure the players are focused on excelling in the classroom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders was recently on the receiving end of a sharply worded letter from a University of Colorado professor, which provided details of some players&apos; lack of &quot;personal responsibility&quot; with academics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well Off Media shared a YouTube video of Sanders reading the letter he received from the professor. Sanders&apos; son, Deion Sanders Jr., manages Well Off Media&apos;s content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/deion-sanders-admits-not-built-coach-nfl-money-clouds-love-passion-football&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEION SANDERS ADMITS HE&apos;S NOT &apos;BUILT&apos; TO COACH IN NFL, SAYS MONEY &apos;CLOUDS LOVE AND PASSION&apos; FOR FOOTBALL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This semester has been extremely challenging for me as a professor,&quot; Sanders said, reading the letter aloud during what appeared to be a team meeting. &quot;I have never felt so disrespected in my ten years of teaching. Students do not follow even minimally, and it slows down my class so much. They make it clear that they don&apos;t want to be here and have very little personal responsibility.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two-time &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Super Bowl champion&lt;/a&gt; then began emphasizing the importance of classroom conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You present, but you ain’t really there,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;You on the field, but you ain’t really doing nothing. You in a relationship, but you ain’t got no love. You at the mall, but you ain’t got no money. Got a lot of ability, but no darn talent because you don’t think.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders then mentioned players&apos; respective NFL Draft &quot;grades.&quot; Someone, presumably a member of Colorado&apos;s staff, then suggested some players on the team lacked a grade entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You gonna get something out of this,&quot; Sanders told the team. &quot;You gonna be a man or you&apos;re going to be a great football player. Since you choose not to be a great football player, we gotta make you a man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders seemed compelled to remind some of the players about the reality many of them will not make it to the NFL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m a little frustrated. I’m a little angry right now, because … we got youngsters that’s all in on one side of the game,&quot; Sanders added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ninety percent or 95% of your roster ain’t going pro. So, coaches, we gotta emphasize education. We gotta emphasize life. We gotta emphasize the next step, the next elevation if it don’t work in the game.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado will play its first season this fall as a member of the Big 12 after the school&apos;s departure from the Pac-12 Conference. The Buffaloes finished last season with a 4-8 record, but star quarterback &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/shedeur-sanders-not-declaring-nfl-draft-we-got-pieces&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Shedeur Sanders&lt;/a&gt; is returning for his senior season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>WrestleMania 40: Rhea Ripley tops Becky Lynch in hotly contested match to retain women&apos;s title</title>
                    
                    <description>Rhea Ripley battled Becky Lynch in a classic WrestleMania match Saturday night. She retained her women&amp;apos;s world championship via pinfall.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/wwe-champ-rhea-ripley-eager-australia-homecoming-elimination-chamber&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rhea Ripley&lt;/a&gt; and Becky Lynch heated up a chilly Lincoln Financial Field Saturday night to start WrestleMania 40 with the women&apos;s world championship on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/wwe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ripley and Lynch&lt;/a&gt; put on a classic match for the Philadelphia fans. It started with Lynch narrating excerpts from her book, &quot;The Man: Not Your Average Girl,&quot; before she entered the ring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motionless in White, the band known for Ripley’s theme song, performed &quot;Demon in Your Dreams&quot; live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, it was time to get to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynch worked on the tweaked wrist of Ripley, dragging her down by the arm as &quot;The Eradicator&quot; tried to inflict damage from the top rope. Lynch planted Ripley with a tornado DDT but only picked up a two-count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynch had all the momentum. She hit a leg drop as Ripley was hanging over the middle rope. She then slammed Ripley into the barricade. Taking her back into the ring, Lynch hit a leg drop from the middle rope. But, again, only a two-count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ripley, wearing a &quot;Mami&quot; collar around her neck, then caught Lynch, who tried to continue her assault, and slammed her. Then, Ripley caught Lynch with a knee. But the pin didn’t go far enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/wrestlemania-40-night-1-preview-the-rock-makes-in-ring-return-for-crucial-tag-team-match&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WRESTLEMANIA 40 NIGHT 1 PREVIEW: THE ROCK MAKES IN-RING RETURN FOR CRUCIAL TAG-TEAM MATCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynch avoided an early riptide attempt, and Lynch got Ripley into an armbar on the wrist. Ripley picked up Lynch and powerbombed her twice before delivering a sit-down powerbomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ripley and Lynch both gave each other everything they had, including slaps, headbutts, armbars and finishing maneuvers. A missed leg drop nearly cost Lynch the match as Ripley applied the prison trap in the middle of the ring. Lynch, somehow, turned it into a pinning maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynch was maybe a half-second away from winning the championship from Ripley when she hit the man-handle slam, but Ripley escaped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ripley may have had the win if not for Lynch’s resilience. She hit another riptide late in the match, but Lynch kicked out of the pin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynch superplexed Ripley and rolled the move into the disarmher. Ripley countered out it and hit an electric chair outside of the ring. Ripley got her back in the ring, and Ripley hit a frog splash from the top rope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ripley wasn’t done. After Lynch kicked out, the Irish star tried to take Ripley to the top rope. But a man-handle slam would be countered. Ripley hit two consecutive rip tides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ripley pinned Lynch to retain the title she initially won against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/wrestlemania-39-sees-sami-zayn-kevin-owens-rhea-ripley-win-championships-first-night&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Charlotte Flair at the last WrestleMania&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there anyone in the women&apos;s division who can stop Ripley?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>3 solar eclipse myths and misconceptions — and the truth behind them</title>
                    
                    <description>Ahead of the April 8 eclipse, Prevent Blindness, a Chicago health and safety organization dedicated to protecting sight, is encouraging eye safety by dispelling some common misconceptions.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As one of the biggest marvels of science, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/planet-earth/solar-eclipse&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;solar eclipse&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; carries an air of mystery — which can lead to some mistaken assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the April 8 eclipse, Prevent Blindness, a Chicago health and safety organization dedicated to fighting blindness and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/vision-and-hearing&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;saving sight&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is encouraging eye safety by dispelling some common misconceptions surrounding the eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/solar-eclipse-2024-8-strange-things-rare-event&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SOLAR ECLIPSE 2024: 8 STRANGE THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN DURING THE RARE EVENT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Todd, president and CEO of the organization, shared with Fox News Digital some of the biggest myths — and the truths around them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One common misconception is the belief that it’s safe to look at the sun if it’s only for a minute or two, Todd said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Eclipse viewers should &lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt; look directly at the sun, as it can cause permanent eye damage,&quot; he warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Exposing your eyes to the sun without proper eye protection during a solar eclipse can cause ‘eclipse blindness’ or retinal burns, also known as solar retinopathy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/solar-eclipse-2024-where-how-view-rare-orbit-hitting-us&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SOLAR ECLIPSE 2024: WHERE AND HOW TO VIEW THE RARE ORBIT HITTING THE US&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todd acknowledged, however, that there is a very brief period during a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;total solar eclipse&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when it can be safe to remove your glasses.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/solar-eclipse-eye-safety-can-staring-cause-blindness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLAR ECLIPSE EYE SAFETY: CAN STARING AT THE SUN CAUSE BLINDNESS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The only time it is safe to do so without proper protection or equipment occurs when the moon is completely covering the sun — and even then, viewers should do so cautiously,&quot; he told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also important to know that not all eclipses are the same, Todd noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is never safe to look at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/science&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;partial solar eclipse&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — at any time during the event — without proper eye protection.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching a solar eclipse on your smartphone camera can put you at risk of accidentally looking at the sun when trying to line up your camera and stage a perfect shot, Todd warned — and it’s also possible that this could damage your smartphone camera.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/how-photograph-total-solar-eclipse-tips-amateur-photographers&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HOW TO PHOTOGRAPH TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE: TIPS FOR AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHERS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thinking that it’s safe to use your camera’s viewfinder is another common misconception,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Looking at a solar eclipse through the optical viewfinder of a camera can damage your eyes in the same way that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space/sun&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;looking at the sun&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; directly without proper protection can.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are ways to safely photograph an eclipse, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you’re planning on trying to capture your own solar eclipse photos or videos, take the time to review the guidelines in advance to ensure that you are properly prepared,&quot; he advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it is never OK to look directly at the sun, the idea that eclipses emit harmful rays that can cause blindness is a misconception, according to Todd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you’re using proper eye protection and practicing caution, you can safely experience the solar eclipse,&quot; he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Always consult an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/health-care&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;eye care professional&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for additional guidance if you have questions or concerns about eye safety.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todd encouraged those who will be viewing the total solar eclipse on Monday to make safety a top priority.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional information and resources from safety experts online can be found at PreventBlindness.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews/health&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Iowa&apos;s close win over UConn in women&apos;s Final Four draws record ratings</title>
                    
                    <description>Earlier this week, Iowa played in a record-setting Elite Eight game, but the Hawkeyes&amp;apos; matchup with UConn drew even more viewers Friday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Women&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk/march-madness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;college basketball&lt;/a&gt; continues to captivate the nation&apos;s attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a few days ago, the rematch of last year&apos;s NCAA Division I women&apos;s basketball national championship between LSU and Iowa drew more than 12 million viewers. It became the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/caitlin-clark-iowa-lsu-march-madness-matchup-record-ratings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;most watched women&apos;s college basketball&lt;/a&gt; game on record — until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 9.9 million viewers tuned in last year to watch the Angel Reese-led Tigers defeat Caitlin Clark and the Hawkeyes in the championship game. ESPN revealed that Iowa&apos;s narrow win over the UConn Huskies drew a record-shattering 14.2 million viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game became ESPN&apos;s most watched college basketball game in history — men&apos;s or women&apos;s. The game peaked at around 17 million viewers, according to ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/controversial-call-iowa-narrow-victory-uconn-draws-fiery-reaction&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONTROVERSIAL CALL IN IOWA&apos;S NARROW VICTORY OVER UCONN DRAWS FIERY REACTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday&apos;s Final Four started with the undefeated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/south-carolina-dominates-nc-state-reach-womens-basketball-national-title-game&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;South Carolina Gamecocks&lt;/a&gt; going against North Carolina State. ESPN noted that an average of 7.1 million tuned in to watch South Carolina eliminate N.C. State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viewers were treated to a thrilling game that featured some of the most recognizable stars in the sport. But a late-game sequence sparked controversy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A costly turnover with just a minute remaining led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/connecticut-huskies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;UConn guard&lt;/a&gt; Nika Muhl’s 3-pointer to cut into Iowa&apos;s lead. The Huskies trailed by just one point with just under ten seconds remaining and had possession. But with just 3.9 seconds left and a 70-69 lead for Iowa, UConn&apos;s Aaliyah Edwards was called for an illegal screen on Iowa&apos;s Gabbie Marshall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edwards was setting a pick to presumably set up Paige Bueckers for a potential game-winning shot. But the offensive foul call resulted in a turnover, and UConn never got the ball back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edwards later said referees did not offer an explanation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wasn’t given an explanation,&quot; she said after the game. &quot;There was no real time to get an explanation. From my point of view, it was pretty clean.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iowa and South Carolina play for the NCAA women&apos;s national championship Sunday at 3 p.m. ET in what could be another record-setting meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>New Jersey Gov Phil Murphy faces flak for not returning to state following historic earthquake</title>
                    
                    <description>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy came under fire after he did not return to the Garden State following the historic earthquake on Friday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy&lt;/a&gt; came under fire after he did not return to the Garden State following the historic earthquake on Friday that left residents rattled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, N.J.-R, spoke with &quot;FOX News Live&quot; on Saturday after Murphy did not issue an on-camera address to residents, despite a few TV and phone interviews, including an interview Saturday with CBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We haven’t heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/governors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;from the governor&lt;/a&gt; — and you know, on a lighter side, Arthel, there are those that say maybe it’s good he didn’t come, because every time he’s in New Jersey, he’s increasing taxes, tolls, fees and subsidizing illegals,&quot; Van Drew told &quot;FOX News Live&quot; co-anchor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/n/arthel-neville&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Arthel Neville&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But on a serious note, he wasn’t at a world summit for world peace. I mean he was at a Democratic convention — basically an association of democratic governors who were probably working on ways to make more democratic governors,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/earthquake-strikes-new-jersey-shaking-buildings-surrounding-states&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.8 MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE STRIKES NEW JERSEY, SHAKING BUILDINGS IN SURROUNDING STATES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Drew said that residents were forced to look to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York leadership&lt;/a&gt; for guidance during the natural disaster — rather than their own governor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So I think he could have taken maybe even 12 hours out to come back to New Jersey. Our folks in New Jersey really had to look to New York — to New York officials — and what they were saying,&quot; Van Drew said. &quot;Even though the actual earthquake was centered in Lebanon, New Jersey, in the northwestern part of the state.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/republicans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Republican representative&lt;/a&gt; said Murphy could have easily traveled back to his state to assure residents that they were safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It would have been a nice symbol if he came back and said, ‘you know what, everything’s going to be OK. I want to personally review the infrastructure myself, see what the team has done, and then he could have gotten back to the convention, the association that he was at,&quot; Van Drew said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6350364594112&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOX WEATHER SPEAKS TO NJ RESIDENTS FROM THE EARTHQUAKE&apos;S EPICENTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So I personally was a little disappointed that he didn’t make it. It’s just good for people to know that their leaders are there during times of problems,&quot; he said. &quot;And even though, in, you know, the world scheme of earthquakes, with what California sees or some other states — this was not huge — it was the biggest earthquake the state of New Jersey has had almost in a century and a half. I wish he had been there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News has reached out to Murphy&apos;s office for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, the governor wrote on X that the state&apos;s emergency operations center was deactivated on Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our State Emergency Operations Center has deactivated as of 10:00 a.m. today,&quot; Murphy wrote. &quot;We have had no reports &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/earthquakes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;of major damage&lt;/a&gt; to structures, roadways, or infrastructure as a result of yesterday’s earthquake.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earthquake measured at least 4.8 magnitude and struck near Lebanon, New Jersey, at 10:23 a.m. on Friday, about 45 miles west of New York City and 50 miles north of Philadelphia, according to the USGS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimate indicates the quake might have been felt by more than 42 million people in 14 states from Maine to North Carolina. More than two-dozen aftershocks have been felt since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 152,000 Americans reported feeling shaking to the USGS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>WWE star Cody Rhodes revealed Friday his tour bus caught fire in the wee hours of the morning. He wrote on social media that everyone was OK.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;WWE star Cody Rhodes had a scare a day before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/wrestlemania-40-night-1-preview-the-rock-makes-in-ring-return-for-crucial-tag-team-match&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WrestleMania 40 Night 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; where he will team with Seth Rollins to take on The Rock and Roman Reigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhodes started Friday thanking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/pennsylvania&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Philadelphia Fire Department&lt;/a&gt;, sparking concerns around the pro wrestling world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then revealed what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Before you hear it elsewhere - my tour bus caught fire last night,&quot; Rhodes wrote on X. &quot;Everybody is safe and okay  The 2 items I grabbed before I got off will probably pop wrestling fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Again, thank you @PhillyFireDept.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He later told Pat McAfee on his radio show the fire started around 1 a.m. ET as he was about to go to sleep. He said his driver noticed the flames and urged everyone to get off the bus immediately. He grabbed his WrestleMania boots and some pictures before leaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/wwe-star-cody-rhodes-talks-preparation-wrestlemania-40-hes-set-main-event-both-nights&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WWE STAR CODY RHODES TALKS PREPARATION FOR WRESTLEMANIA 40 AS HE&apos;S SET TO MAIN EVENT BOTH NIGHTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think the universe was saying, &apos;Hey, we&apos;re going to set your bus on fire and you&apos;re still going to go in and wipe the floor with The Bloodline on Saturday. You&apos;re still going to do it,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhodes’ match at Night 1 of WrestleMania may have implications on Night 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/dwayne-the-rock-johnson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Rock&lt;/a&gt; and Reigns defeat Rhodes and Rollins, Rhodes’ WWE undisputed universal championship match against Reigns on Sunday would be contested under Bloodline Rhodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WrestleMania 40 will take place at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A man was caught on surveillance cameras cutting down and stealing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/american-flags-families-friends-neighbors-heart-endeavor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;an American flag&lt;/a&gt; at a Disabled American Veterans (DAV) chapter in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveillance video shared on social media by the chapter showed a man with a yellow t-shirt and jeans surveying the flag pole at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Titusville, Florida, nonprofit&lt;/a&gt; before proceeding to vandalize it on Tuesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, he is seen taking what appeared to be a knife and cutting down the flag pole strings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old Glory is seen billowing to the ground before the man is seen reaching down to the ground and crumpling up the flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/dead-injured-police-officer-miami-dade-county-shooting&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TWO DEAD, SEVEN INJURED, INCLUDING POLICE OFFICER, AFTER MIAMI-DADE COUNTY SHOOTING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities said that along with vandalizing the national symbol, he damaged an outdoor grill and seating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/veterans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;areas that veterans&lt;/a&gt; regularly used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commander John Dunn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/man-steals-american-flag-vandalizes-property-at-disabled-american-veterans-center&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;told FOX 35&lt;/a&gt; that he was heartbroken when he watched the flag hit the ground and disappointed because crimes like this take away resources from veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His heartbreak turned into heartfelt gratitude overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I came home quite angry last night,&quot; he said. &quot;But, after I saw the support on Facebook and how they found this guy within an hour. We had his name within an hour and where he was located. It spread so fast, I couldn’t imagine, wow!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunn shared on Facebook that people in the community jumped to assist the veteran nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/medal-of-honor-recipients-reveal-feelings-about-receiving-tremendous-honor-wildly-bittersweet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENTS REVEAL FEELINGS ABOUT RECEIVING ‘TREMENDOUS HONOR’: ‘WILDLY BITTERSWEET’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These people presented DAV 109 with a brand new Pit Boss pellet grill to replace the grill that got destroyed last Tuesday. Along with that, we have two more couples donating grills to the chapter,&quot; Dunn wrote. &quot;We would like to thank everyone who has been showing support for the chapter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/money&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;along with donations&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Titusville Police Department&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that they captured the vandal on Friday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Wayne Smyth, 42, of Mims, Florida, was charged with Burglary, Criminal Mischief and Petit Theft, the Titusville Police Department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smyth was located on Friday at approximately 3 p.m. and taken into custody without incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities said that he was booked into the Brevard County Jail and is currently being held without bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
