                    <title>Cowboys&apos; Micah Parsons weighs in on NBA-NFL player debate: &apos;It ain’t hard to dunk&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Dallas Cowboys pass rusher Micah Parsons pushed back former NBA guard Lou Williams&amp;apos; assertion that the NBA-NFL player debate isn&amp;apos;t a &amp;quot;physicality conversation.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/dallas-cowboys&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; star Micah Parsons weighed in on the debate over whether NBA players could fit into the NFL and vice versa as he responded to former guard Lou Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams, a three-time Sixth Man of the Year winner, said on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELp4RinQU50&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Underground Lounge&quot;&lt;/a&gt; he thought &quot;everybody should respect everybody’s craft.&quot; He didn’t think there were 30 NBA players who could play in the NFL nor did he think the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My problem where this conversation is going is I don’t like the fact that the NFL players are saying, their argument is, ‘Y’all soft. Y’all flop.’ This and that,&quot; Williams said. &quot;Let’s be clear, y’all motherf---ers flop too. Is football more than running, jumping, catching? Hell yeah. It’s agility It’s smart. It’s chess. It’s being able to beat your man off the line. Trying to teach somebody in front of you that’s trying to beat you off the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I respect all of that s---. But when we start getting into the conversation about basketball players being soft this and that, basketball is way more contact than we get credit for. There’s p---ies on both sides, bro. I don’t want this conversation to get swayed like we the only ones p---ies. No, no. I see some of y’all n----s catching that ball getting down too. Let’s not make this a physicality conversation. Let’s talk about skill.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parsons responded to Williams in a post on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I dead a-- watch mf go 0 points and play 30 minutes ! I it ain’t hard to dunk or make a lay up,&quot; he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/jason-kelce-believes-turn-lebron-james-greatest-redzone-threat-nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JASON KELCE BELIEVES HE COULD TURN LEBRON JAMES INTO THE &apos;GREATEST REDZONE THREAT IN THE NFL&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parsons participated in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game in February. He scored 37 points and grabbed 16 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire debate started last week when Austin Rivers claimed he could take &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;30 NBA players&lt;/a&gt; and work them seamlessly into the NFL, during an interview on &quot;The Pat McAfee Show.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You cannot take 30 NFL players and put them in the NBA,&quot; Rivers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/jj-watt-roasts-austin-rivers-implying-nba-players-could-play-nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;criticism from J.J. Watt&lt;/a&gt;, Rivers further explained his points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;@JJWatt played 11 years [in the NBA] broski. Might play next year in fact… that would make it 12,&quot; Rivers posted, &quot;..like someone I know. Respect your [sic] a football legend holding it down for the bros. My comments weren’t meant to be disrespectful. Only a point to how athletically gifted SOME NBA players are…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;U don’t think Ant man [Anthony Edwards] could make that transition to the NFL? Wide receiver? Prime Lebron? Zion [Williamson]? Prime d rose [Derrick Rose] or [Russell] Westbrook? Aaron Gordon at tight end? Now give me yours for the NFL to the NBA… I’ll wait. Notice I never said myself btw. So easy on the shade towards me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Scott Thompson contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>California mom dies saving drowning daughter just before Mother&apos;s Day: sheriff</title>
                    
                    <description>A California mother died saving her drowning daughter in the San Joaquin River May 9, the Stanislaus County Sheriff&amp;apos;s Office said.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A mother&apos;s love knows no boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was especially true on May 9 when Brenda Duran jumped into the San Joaquin River in central California to rescue her drowning daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mom watched her children playing in the water of a popular beach, but when her 11-year-old daughter could not keep her head above water, Duran rushed into the river, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Stanislaus County Sheriff&apos;s Office.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she sought to save her daughter, Duran &quot;struggled to stay afloat,&quot; the sheriff&apos;s office said, and the river&apos;s current swallowed the mom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/americans-stranded-norwegian-cruise-save-elderly-passenger-family-says-ship-left-her-die&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;AMERICANS, INCLUDING SOUTH CAROLINA COUPLE, STRANDED BY NORWEGIAN CRUISE SAVE ELDERLY PASSENGER, FAMILY SAYS: SHIP ‘LEFT HER TO DIE’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her son, 14, saw his mom in trouble and jumped back into the river to try to grab her, but he could not get to her in time, according to the Stanislaus County Sheriff&apos;s Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was around 6:30 p.m. on May 9. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;First responders&lt;/a&gt;, including rescue dive teams, spent hours in the water, but &quot;visibility and safety&quot; concerns forced the search to be paused around 11 p.m., police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/search-missing-south-carolina-cruise-passenger-complicated-jungle-terrain-family-demands-us-help&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOLUNTEERS&apos; SEARCH FOR MISSING DAD WHO DISAPPEARED DURING CRUISE EXCURSION COMPLICATED BY JUNGLE TERRAIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duran&apos;s body was recovered around 5:30 p.m. on May 11 outside Newman, California. She was just 30 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Brenda&apos;s husband describes her as a ‘very thriving person, always smiling, never giving up and very compassionate,’&quot; Yadira Herrera wrote on a GoFundMe post on behalf of Duran&apos;s family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Brenda, a young mother full of love and laughter, leaves behind her three children, her husband and her extended family that will forever hold her in her heart.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stanislaus County Sheriff&apos;s Office said an autopsy will be conducted later this week to establish an official cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We extend our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Brenda Duran during this time,&quot; the sheriff&apos;s office said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 366-mile San Joaquin River starts in Yosemite and Kings Canyon National Parks and runs through the San Joaquin Valley south of Sacramento. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The river is known for its teeming wildlife, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/travel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;economy-fueled tourism&lt;/a&gt; that includes paddling, swimming and fishing, and hydroelectric power.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Kazakhstani ex-government official sentenced for wife&apos;s torture and murder in Central Asia</title>
                    
                    <description>Kazakhstan’s Supreme Court has convicted a former government official of torturing and brutally murdering his wife and sentenced him to prison, officials say.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan&apos;s Supreme Court on Monday convicted a former government official of torturing and murdering his wife and sentenced him to 24 years in prison in a case that has gripped the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/asia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Central Asian&lt;/a&gt; nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the trial of Kuandyk Bishimbayev, Kazakhstan’s former economy minister, over the death of his wife, Saltanat Nukenova, thousands of people urged the authorities to adopt harsher penalties for domestic violence. Authorities adopted a bill toughening spousal abuse laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan largely remains a patriarchal society, and progress has been slow on issues such as domestic violence, sexual harassment and disparities in employment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/domestic-violence-rates-remain-high-three-years-record-spike-pandemic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RATES REMAIN HIGH THREE YEARS AFTER RECORD SPIKE DURING PANDEMIC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bishimbayev’s trial was the first in the country of over 19 million people to be streamed online, and debates about it dominated social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nukenova, 31, was found dead in November in a restaurant owned by one of her husband’s relatives. The 44-year-old Bishimbayev maintained his innocence before admitting in court last month that he had beaten her and &quot;unintentionally&quot; caused her death. His lawyers initially disputed medical evidence indicating Nukenova died from blows to the head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bishimbayev&apos;s relative, Bakhytzhan Baizhanov, was sentenced to four years in prison for helping Bishimbayev cover up the murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days after Nukenova’s death, her relatives launched an online petition urging authorities to pass &quot;Saltanat’s Law&quot; to bolster protection for those at risk of domestic violence. It quickly got over 150,000 signatures. As the trial began, more than 5,000 Kazakhs wrote senators urging &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;tougher laws&lt;/a&gt; on abuse, Kazakh media said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has repeatedly spoken about strengthening protections for women. In January, he intervened after the Justice Ministry refused to consider the petition by Nukenova’s family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a 2018 study backed by UN Women, about 400 women die from domestic violence each year in Kazakhstan, although many cases go unreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Kazakhstan decriminalized beatings and other acts causing &quot;minor&quot; physical damage, making them punishable only by fines or short jail terms. Kazakhstan has since reversed its law, increasing penalties for assailants and introducing new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;criminal offenses&lt;/a&gt;, including harassment of minors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senate Speaker Maulen Ashimbayev said that properly implementing the new law adopted in the wake of the trial will require &quot;a great deal of work,&quot; including educational campaigns in schools and the media as well as vigilance from civil society groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-see-embattled-menendezs-potential-independent-bid-chance-flip-senate-seat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sen. Bob Menendez&lt;/a&gt;, D-N.J., is facing his second federal corruption trial in a decade, as jury selection is scheduled to begin in Manhattan federal court on Monday, this time related to charges alleging that he acted to benefit the governments of Egypt and Qatar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 70-year-old New Jersey Democrat and his wife, Nadine Menendez, are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/corruption&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;accused of accepting bribes&lt;/a&gt; from three wealthy businessmen – real estate developer Fred Daibes, Wael Hana and Jose Uribe – in his home state and performing a variety of favors in return, including meddling in criminal investigations and taking actions benefiting the governments of Egypt and Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menendez, 70, will stand trial along with two of the businessmen, Daibes and Hana. All three have pleaded not guilty. Uribe has pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against the other defendants. A trial for the senator’s wife, who is also charged, is delayed until at least July for health reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three-term senator has announced he will not be seeking reelection on the Democratic ticket this fall, although he has not ruled out running as an independent. That could complicate things for Democrats who have a narrow edge in the U.S. Senate and can hardly afford the prospect of a three-way election in the Democratic stronghold of New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-house-dems-defend-texas-congressman-accused-accepting-mexican-bribes-very-different-reasons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP, HOUSE DEMS DEFEND TEXAS CONGRESSMAN ACCUSED OF ACCEPTING MEXICAN BRIBES, BUT FOR VERY DIFFERENT REASONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday saw several new court filings from defense teams, but the judge has yet to rule on those matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for Menendez accused prosecutors of not acting in good faith by seeking to have members of the Qatari Investment Company, who have already been interviewed by government counsel, avoid cross examination at trial. The senators’ lawyers allege &quot;the government knows from their meetings with the Qatari Investment Company Deponents’ counsel and with one of the Qatari Investment Company Deponents that the Deponents’ testimony would disprove the story the government wants to tell.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam Fee and Avi Weitzman, Menendez’s lawyers, said the &quot;government will do whatever it can to prevent the jury from hearing the truth from the Qatari Investment Company Deponents, while also presenting to the jury dozens of communications from those very same witnesses.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Court should not reward the government’s sharp tactics,&quot; they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, current and former attorneys for Uribe, who is expected to testify as a witness at trial in the government’s case, accuse Menendez of &quot;a blatant and improper attempt to end-run around the discovery limitations&quot; through &quot;three facially improper subpoenas,&quot; which seek information about Uribe’s plea agreement with prosecutors, payments Uribe made toward Menendez’s wife’s Mercedes-Benz and other communications and documents. Uribe pleaded guilty on March 1 pursuant to a cooperation agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Indeed, it appears that by serving not one but three clearly and facially defective subpoenas, failing to respond to Uribe’s counsel’s objections and requests to withdraw them, and disguising a Rule 17(c) subpoena as one for trial testimony, Menendez and his counsel are intentionally attempting to create an inappropriate burden on – and distraction for – Uribe shortly before the trial begins,&quot; Uribe&apos;s lawyers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After charges were announced in September, Menendez was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democratic-sen-bob-menendez-steps-down-temporairly-chairman-senate-foreign-relations-committe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;forced out of his powerful post&lt;/a&gt; as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senator&apos;s political career had its first major crisis in 2015 when he was indicted on charges involving a wealthy Florida eye doctor accused of buying Menendez’s influence through luxury vacations and campaign contributions. At the time, Menendez resolutely denied the charges and vowed not to quit the Senate. A trial ended in 2017 with a deadlocked jury, and federal prosecutors in New Jersey abandoned the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menendez not only stayed in Congress, he was reelected and kept his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee. He married Nadine Menendez in 2020 after the couple dated for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new case, federal prosecutors stressed that FBI agents who searched the senator&apos;s New Jersey home allegedly found a stash of gold bars, worth more than $100,000, and more than $486,000 in cash, some of it stuffed into the pockets of clothing hanging in his closets in a raid two years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menendez has remained in the Senate amid this latest indictment, ignoring calls for him to step down before his six-year term ends Jan. 3. Unlike in 2015, though, his party has largely abandoned him. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and others called on him to resign. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rep-andy-kim-gains-traction-bid-new-jerseys-senate-seat-primary-victories-3-counties&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Democratic Rep. Andy Kim&lt;/a&gt; launched a campaign for Menendez’s seat the day after the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-bob-menendez-may-blame-wife-nadine-federal-corruption-trial-court-docs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEN BOB MENENDEZ MAY BLAME HIS WIFE NADINE DURING FEDERAL CORRUPTION TRIAL: COURT DOCS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His fellow Democrats in Washington, D.C., appear to have already written him off, encouraging him repeatedly to resign, but Menendez has maintained a defiant stance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am innocent and will prove it no matter how many charges they continue to pile on,&quot; he said after the indictment against him was updated again in early March to add charges that he tried to obstruct the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides charges including bribery, extortion, fraud and obstruction of justice, Menendez also is charged with acting as a foreign agent of Egypt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menendez has vigorously denied doing anything unusual in his dealings with foreign officials. The senator&apos;s lawyers in court papers have said they plan to explain that Menendez had no knowledge of some of what occurred because his wife, who allegedly often served as a conduit between the men paying the bribes, kept him in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to an indictment, Daibes delivered gold bars and cash to Menendez and his wife to get the senator&apos;s help with a multimillion-dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund, prompting Menendez to act in ways &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrat-sen-bob-menendez-charged-accepting-bribes-benefit-qatar-superseding-federal-indictment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;favorable to Qatar&apos;s government&lt;/a&gt;. The indictment also said Menendez did things benefiting Egyptian officials in exchange for bribes from Hana, as the businessman secured a valuable deal with the Egyptian government to certify that imported meat met Islamic dietary requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In pleading guilty several weeks ago, Uribe admitted buying Menendez&apos;s wife a Mercedes-Benz to get the senator&apos;s help to influence criminal investigations involving his business associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Sidney H. Stein has rejected Menendez’s attempt to claim legislative immunity protects him from the charges. The judge has yet to rule on whether the defense can call a psychiatrist to show Menendez habitually stored cash in his home as a &quot;fear of scarcity&quot; response to family stories about how their savings were confiscated in the Communist revolution in Cuba, before he was born, and because of financial problems stemming from the gambling problem of his father, a struggling carpenter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Jennifer Johnson and the Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>South Carolina woman Mica Miller&apos;s husband says he tried to &apos;raise her from the dead&apos; during eulogy</title>
                    
                    <description>South Carolina pastor John-Paul Miller on Saturday gave a eulogy for his late wife, Mica Miller, who died by suicide on April 27, saying he tried to &amp;quot;raise her from the dead.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide &amp;amp; Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Carolina pastor John-Paul Miller on Saturday remembered his late wife, Mica Miller, in a eulogy at his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/south-carolina&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Myrtle Beach congregation&lt;/a&gt;, saying at one point that he tried to &quot;raise her from the dead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mica Miller, 30, died by suicide on April 27 after calling authorities to her location at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/north-carolina&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Lumber River State Park in North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, about an hour&apos;s drive from Myrtle Beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller began his eulogy at his congregation called Solid Rock at Common Market by talking about his late wife&apos;s beauty, saying &quot;everyone knew how beautiful she was on the outside,&quot; but only &quot;a spouse knows how beautiful that person is on the inside.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She was beautiful on the outside. She won so many beautiful pageants when she was young,&quot; he said in the eulogy, which was posted to YouTube. &quot;…But I got to lay next to her body and spend time with her body about four times this week, and each time, it still didn&apos;t hit me. I thought she was gonna wake up. I even tried to raise her from the dead one time this week.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/mica-miller-911-call-reveals-final-moments-before-her-death-nc-authorities-challenge-conspiracy-theories&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MICA MILLER 911 CALL REVEALS FINAL MOMENTS BEFORE HER DEATH AS NC AUTHORITIES CHALLENGE ‘CONSPIRACY THEORIES’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pastor went on to describe Mica&apos;s zest for life and dedication to the church. He also described her love of travel for mission trips and other vacations to places like Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Disney World and Africa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robeson County Medical Examiner Richard Johnson ruled Miller died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 27. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Robeson County Sheriff Burnis Wilkins&lt;/a&gt; called the evidence &quot;quite clear and compelling.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/mica-miller-case-cause-death-revealed-south-carolina-pastors-wife&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MICA MILLER CASE: CAUSE OF DEATH REVEALED FOR SOUTH CAROLINA PASTOR&apos;S WIFE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While I know it’s not what many people wanted to hear, the evidence is quite clear and compelling, and we are as saddened as anyone that this occurred. There are many factors that we have reviewed that occurred over an extended period of time that are probably related to the reason for this investigation, but in the end, sadly, a tragic decision was made by Mica that ended her life,&quot; Wilkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John-Paul announced his wife&apos;s suicide April 28, the day after her death, ABC 15 reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mica Miller was in the process of formally separating from her husband, and had filed three &quot;separate support and maintenance&quot; requests since last year, the latest on April 16. Separate support and maintenance allows one spouse to receive court-ordered support from another spouse without officially divorcing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators determined that Mica purchased a 9mm Sig Sauer handgun from a pawn shop on the morning she allegedly died by suicide. Authorities found the gun case and a receipt for the purchase in her vehicle at Lumber River State Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/death-south-carolina-pastors-wife-under-investigation-family-warns-false-stories-suicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DEATH OF SOUTH CAROLINA PASTOR&apos;S WIFE UNDER INVESTIGATION AS HER FAMILY WARNS OF &apos;FALSE&apos; STORIES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They later recovered a 9mm Sig Sauer handgun where she was found dead, noting the same &quot;serial number on the weapon matched the gun box that was found in Miller’s Honda Accord.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 911 call made to Robseon County at 2:54 p.m., which was shared by the sheriff&apos;s office, Mica can be heard asking a dispatcher if she can track down her location. When the dispatcher says she tracked Mica to the Lumber River State Park, she asked Mica why she wanted her location known. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/husband-found-bodies-wife-kids-murder-suicide-im-dead-inside&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HUSBAND WHO FOUND BODIES OF WIFE, KIDS IN MURDER-SUICIDE: &apos;I&apos;M DEAD INSIDE&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tell me what happened,&quot; the dispatcher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m about to kill myself, and I just want my family to know where to find me,&quot; Mica can be heard saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/true-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;GO HERE FOR MORE TRUE CRIME FROM FOX NEWS DIGITAL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robeson County Sheriff&apos;s Office investigators also determined that John-Paul &quot;and a female that he is allegedly romantically involved with&quot; were not in Robeson County at the time of Mica&apos;s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Investigators learned through interviews that John Paul Miller was at an athletic event in Charleston on the day of Mica Miller’s death. John Miller’s vehicle was observed traveling on Hwy 17 Bypass, in Horry County at 2:22 pm on April 27, 2024,&quot; the sheriff&apos;s office said in a press release. &quot;The investigation confirmed that John Miller was accompanied while traveling to and from the event in Charleston, SC.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A curator at the American Museum of Natural History was detained &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/turkey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; on Monday while allegedly attempting to smuggle spider and scorpion samples, Turkish media reported. The curator said he had permits from the government to conduct his research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenzo Prendini, an expert on arachnids at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York-based&lt;/a&gt; museum, was held by police at Istanbul Airport while allegedly trying to take about 1,500 samples out of the country, news outlets reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state-run Anadolu news agency reported that Prendini was detained for allegedly attempting to smuggle species found in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-man-charged-allegedly-smuggling-rare-butterflies-selling-them-ebay-etsy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK MAN CHARGED FOR ALLEGEDLY SMUGGLING $200K OF RARE BUTTERFLIES, SELLING THEM ON EBAY, ETSY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video published by the Demiroren News Agency showed officers searching hand luggage and removing plastic bags that appeared to be packed with dead spiders and scorpions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In emailed comments to The Associated Press, Prendini said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the police&lt;/a&gt; had disregarded permits from the Turkish government to conduct his research in collaboration with Turkish scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The police completely ignored this and relied on the testimony of an ‘expert’ who has a conflict of interest with my collaborators … and whose scientific research is highly questionable,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The police have completely violated due process, and it appears they would like to find me guilty in the court of public opinion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The museum’s website lists Prendini as the curator of its spider, scorpion, centipede and millipede collections. It says his research into spiders and scorpions has taken him to more than 30 countries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former President Trump has the edge in five of the six key battleground states where he was narrowly edged by &lt;a href=&quot;https://cms.foxnews.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=6023065&amp;amp;action=edit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden &lt;/a&gt;four years ago, according to new polls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surveys, released Monday by the New York Times, Siena College and the Philadelphia Inquirer, suggest that discontent over the economy and the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza, and a deterioration in support for Biden by younger, Black and Hispanic voters, &quot;threaten to unravel the president&apos;s Democratic coalition.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden topped Trump by razor-thin margins in the 2020 election in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to win the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, according to the new polls, with just under six months to go until Election Day, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trump leads&lt;/a&gt; Biden among registered voters 49%-42% in Arizona, 49%-39% in Georgia, 49%-42% in Michigan, 50%-38% in Nevada, and edges the president 47%-44% in Pennsylvania, with Biden narrowly on top in Wisconsin 47%-45%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tales-from-trail-trump-tries-expand-map-flipping-blue-states-red&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024 REMATCH: TRUMP AIMS TO EXPAND THE MAP IN HIS BATTLE WITH BIDEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2024 rematch between the Democratic president and his Republican predecessor was closer among the narrower pool of likely voters. Trump held the advantage in five states - Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin - with Biden edging ahead in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surveys&apos; findings were similar when third-party and independent candidates were added to the mix, including Democrat turned independent White House contender &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/k/robert-f-kennedy-jr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longtime environmental activist and high-profile vaccine skeptic, who is the scion of the nation&apos;s most storied political dynasty, was grabbing around 10% support across the six states. The polls suggested Kennedy was drawing roughly equally from both Biden and Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-and-trump-deadlocked-in-polls-six-months-out-from-2024-presidential-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POLLS INDICATE DEADLOCKED RACE WITH SIX MONTHS UNTIL ELECTION DAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/us/politics/biden-trump-battleground-poll.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;new surveys&lt;/a&gt;, conducted April 28 through May 9, come as Trump makes history as the first current or former president to stand trial in a criminal case. Additionally, they were also conducted amid a massive ad blitz by the Biden campaign across the key battleground states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &quot;the polls offer little indication that any of these developments have helped Mr. Biden, hurt Mr. Trump or quelled the electorate’s discontent,&quot; the New York Times writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surveys spotlight that voters are dissatisfied and itching for change. Nearly seven in 10 said that the nation&apos;s political and economic systems need major changes, or should be entirely torn down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly three-quarters said they believe Trump will bring major changes if he wins in November, compared to less than a quarter saying the same thing about the president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The polls also indicate Trump is making gains with voters who overwhelmingly supported Biden four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE 2024 ELECTION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump and Biden are roughly tied among voters 18–29 years old and Hispanic voters. The surveys also suggest the former president is grabbing over 20% of Black voters&apos; support, which, if it stands on Election Day, would be the highest level of backing by Black voters for a GOP presidential nominee in generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The polls suggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the economy &lt;/a&gt;continues to pull Biden down. Even though jobs are soaring and the stock market is booming, inflation remains a major issue for voters, even though it has cooled over the past year. More than half of those surveyed said they believe the economy is still &quot;poor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the president remains in contention, as the surveys point to Biden holding ground with older voters and White voters, whom the polls highlight &quot;are much less likely to demand fundamental changes to the system and far likelier to say that democracy is the most important issue for their vote.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abortion remains a potential problem for Trump. Nearly two-thirds of voters questioned in polls say that abortion should always or mostly be legal, including 44% of those supporting the former president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/13/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Over 4,000 voters&lt;/a&gt; in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were questioned in the polls, with an overall sampling error for all respondents of plus or minus 1.8 percentage points. The margin of error in the six states ranged from plus or minus 3.6 to 4.6 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Jen Psaki forced to edit book after making misleading claim about Biden not checking watch at ceremony</title>
                    
                    <description>Jen Psaki offered a misleading initial account in her new book of when President Biden was seen looking at his watch during a dignified transfer ceremony.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MSNBC host &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbcs-jen-psaki-surprised-analysts-admit-freakout-stage-trumps-jan-6-trial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jen Psaki&lt;/a&gt; said she will alter future reprints of her book after being called out for downplaying President Biden looking at his watch during a 2021 ceremony for U.S. service members who were killed in Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psaki, who was Biden&apos;s White House press secretary before joining MSNBC, initially claimed in her new book, &quot;Say More,&quot; that Biden never looked at his watch &quot;during the ceremony.&quot; But a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2024/05/13/psaki-book-biden-watch-check-afghanistan?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=editorial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;report by Axios&lt;/a&gt; noted that Psaki’s version contradicted pictures and Gold Star families&apos; firsthand accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psaki, who initially declined comment, changed her tune after online backlash and told Axios &quot;the detail in a few lines of the book about the exact number of times he looked at his watch will be removed in future reprints and the eBook.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soon-to-be removed version of Psaki’s book claimed &quot;the president looked at his watch only after the ceremony had ended,&quot; and the MSNBC star insisted Biden’s critics misrepresented the facts to make Biden appear insensitive. However, Gold Star families have long said they saw Biden check his watch multiple times during the dignified transfer ceremony. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/jen-psaki-urges-biden-join-the-view-defends-dodging-journalists&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JEN PSAKI URGES BIDEN TO JOIN ‘THE VIEW,’ DEFENDS HIM DODGING JOURNALISTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psaki says she told Biden that bringing up his personal experience with family deaths to grieving military family members was insensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The story on Afghanistan is really about the importance of delivering feedback even when it is difficult, told through my own experience of telling President Biden that his own story of loss was not well received by the families who were grieving their sons and daughters,&quot; Psaki told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt; when asked for additional comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, USA Today issued a correction on a &quot;fact check&quot; of the incident after initially claiming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden only checked his watch&lt;/a&gt; when the ceremony was over. USA Today took heat for suggesting the Gold Star families who alleged they saw Biden check his watch multiple times during the dignified transfer ceremony had lied, and the paper issued a correction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/usa-today-correction-fact-check-biden-watch.amp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USA TODAY ISSUES CORRECTION ON &apos;FACT CHECK&apos; AFTER CLAIMING BIDEN CHECKED WATCH &apos;ONLY AFTER CEREMONY&apos; AT DOVER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Corrections &amp;amp; Clarifications: This story was updated Sept. 2 to note that Biden checked his watch multiple times at the dignified transfer event, including during the ceremony itself,&quot; the correction read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psaki also mistakenly cited a Washington Post passage to bolster her account, Axios reported, when the sentences she cited actually came from USA Today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book, &quot;Say More: Lessons from Work, the White House, and the World,&quot; hit stores last week. Psaki, who joined MSNBC in May 2022 and has continued to be a reliable Biden supporter, was blasted by conservatives on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psaki joined MSNBC after a bidding war for her services between the left-leaning cable outlet and CNN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has been defensive about her past work for Biden, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/jen-psaki-erupts-comparisons-between-her-ronna-mcdaniel-truth-versus-lies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;objecting to comparisons&lt;/a&gt; between her and ex-Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel during the latter&apos;s brief tenure as an NBC News analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital’s Joseph A. Wulfsohn contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With a majority of Americans preferring to live in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/longevity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;own homes as long as possible&lt;/a&gt;, experts stress the importance of modifications to keep dwellings safe and accessible. Here&apos;s a summary of tips from the National Institute on Aging and AARP, which offers a free room-by-room guide with practical suggestions for older adults living independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have at least one exterior doorway with step-free access. If not possible, consider a ramp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a bench in the foyer to sit on when removing shoes or to set down items while locking or unlocking the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/when-parent-must-care-parent-how-avoid-caregiving-burnout-according-experts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEN A PARENT MUST CARE FOR A PARENT: HOW TO AVOID CAREGIVING BURNOUT, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install a walk-in shower with a bench and nonskid decals or mats to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;prevent falls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a hand-held nozzle to the shower head to facilitate rinsing off while seated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install grab bars on the shower wall and near the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put in a taller toilet or add a toiler riser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider plugging in a nightlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If stairs are too difficult to manage, create a bedroom on the main level by transforming a den or an office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure the bed is easy to get in and out of. Purchase bed risers, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invest in an adjustable bed for extra comfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purchase a stove with safety features that alert the residents when a burner is on or has automatic shut-offs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relocate major appliances to make them easier to reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add slide-out drawers or trays to existing cabinets for better access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install a lever-style, light-touch or sensor faucet, which is easier to use than a faucet with turn-style knobs or handles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get rid of furniture and clutter to make rooms &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/house-and-home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;easier to move around in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replace chairs with armrests to make it easier to stand and sit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid furniture with sharp corners, which can cause bruises and cuts when bumped up against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hide cords out of pathways — but don’t put them under rugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Area rugs, if used, should be secured to the floor with a nonslip mat or anti-slip rug tape.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>San Francisco under fire for program giving booze to homeless alcoholics: &apos;Where&apos;s the recovery in all this?&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Recovering addict and recovery advocate Tom Wolf said San Francisco&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Managed Alcohol Program&amp;quot; misses the mark when taxpayer funds could go toward other programs to combat addiction.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A $5 million pilot program bringing free beer, wine and vodka shots to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/san-francisco&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;San Francisco&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; homeless alcoholics aims to relieve the city&apos;s emergency services, but one addict-turned-recovery advocate says the effort misses the mark and only delays recovery for those who need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s not a good idea, not when you consider the fact that, over the last four years, San Francisco spent $20 million to basically service a total of a couple of hundred people… by giving them free vodka and beer. For that amount of money, we could have funded 60 drug treatment beds instead,&quot; Tom Wolf, founder of the&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Pacific Alliance for Prevention and Recovery, told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Fox &amp;amp; Friends First.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You really have to ask, where&apos;s the recovery in all of this? What is the desired outcome of this program? They say it&apos;ll save money, but we just spent $20 million bucks over the last four years. You have to really ask, ‘is it saving money, and is it making a difference?’&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/san-francisco-buys-vodka-shots-homeless-alcoholics-taxpayer-funded-program&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAN FRANCISCO BUYS VODKA SHOTS FOR HOMELESS ALCOHOLICS IN TAXPAYER-FUNDED PROGRAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city&apos;s &quot;Managed Alcohol Program&quot; is operated by its Department of Public Health and focuses on administering limited quantities of alcohol to prevent serious side effects of withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s backed by some experts who say it can save lives. Others like Wolf, meanwhile, insist the taxpayer funds would be better suited for treatment and sobriety programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What also accomplishes that goal is actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/drugs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;drug treatment&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; he said of its efficacy. &quot;It may reduce those [emergency] calls and thereby save money but, again, we&apos;re spending $5 million a year to give people free alcohol…&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/blue-state-dems-turn-governor-homeless-council-cant-account-20b-spending&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BLUE STATE DEMS TURN ON GOVERNOR AS HOMELESS COUNCIL CAN&apos;T ACCOUNT FOR $20B IN SPENDING&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolf, a recovering heroin addict, once lived on the street. He said a similar program tailored toward his addiction would have either kept him on the street or he would be dead by now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t really see what the benefit is of all of this, and I&apos;m glad it was exposed,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program also offers life skills classes and cultural outings for patients, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/sf-free-alcohol-homeless-19446850.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlet also said the city&apos;s public health department claims to have found a drop in emergency room visits as well as a reduced hospital stays and emergency calls as a result of the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Chris Pandolfo contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Ukraine&apos;s Kharkiv residents remain defiant as Russia launches new offensive</title>
                    
                    <description>Despite intense fighting in the Kharkiv region, residents of Ukraine&amp;apos;s second largest city, Kharkiv, have remained defiant. The city experienced a temporary respite on Sunday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Residents &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;of Ukraine&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; second-biggest city, Kharkiv, remained defiant despite fierce fighting raging in the region after Russian forces launched an armored incursion on a new front that may presage a broader push into the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As battles raged in the north and east of the Kharkiv region, the city itself enjoyed a rare moment of calm on Sunday, May 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents took to the streets and parks of the city, walking, shopping, taking children to playgrounds. Many attended Sunday church services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/few-hundred-remain-vovchansk-russian-advance-intensifies-northeast-ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ONLY A FEW HUNDRED REMAIN IN VOVCHANSK AS RUSSIAN ADVANCE INTENSIFIES IN NORTHEAST UKRAINE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mood was upbeat, with most people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;saying Russia&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; incursion on the new front will not scare them to flee the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many said they trusted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ukrainian forces&lt;/a&gt; to push Russians away. Others said that despite months of relentless rocket, drone and artillery attacks on the city, they were determined to stay in their homes and hoped their children would grow up in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kharkiv&apos;s governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Saturday there was no imminent danger to the city of Kharkiv and no need to begin evacuating its roughly 1.3 million inhabitants. Kyiv officials have repeatedly said they do not believe Russia has the forces available to capture the city.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Trump, defenders show up in force ahead of Cohen testimony</title>
                    
                    <description>Former President Trump was flanked by Republican politicians and his legal team ahead of going into court Monday, when witness Michael Cohen is expected to deliver testimony.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Former President Trump&lt;/a&gt; was joined by a bevy of high-profile supporters Monday morning outside the Manhattan courtroom, where the NY v. Trump trial will hear from key witness Michael Cohen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Trump spoke to the media early Monday morning, Republican supporters such as Ohio Sen. JD Vance, New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, his son Eric Trump, and others were seen standing behind the 45th president for what is anticipated to be an action-packed day in court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s comments ahead of court Monday focused on his argument that the case is a &quot;baseless, politically motivated prosecution&quot; promoted by the Biden administration, while highlighting a recent poll showing him leading Biden in key battleground states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-cohens-credibility-issues-brazen-tiktok-usage-raise-media-eyebrows-ahead-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MICHAEL COHEN&apos;S CREDIBILITY ISSUES, BRAZEN TIKTOK USAGE RAISE MEDIA EYEBROWS AHEAD OF TESTIMONY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The New York Times just came out with a poll that shows us leading everywhere by a lot. This is the cover story. And I think you&apos;ll find it very interesting, but I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve all read it. Leading in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, Georgia and Nevada. Nevada, we are leading actually by 12 points, which is generally a Democrat state,&quot; Trump said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s 16th day on trial kicks off with testimony from his former personal attorney Michael Cohen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case revolves around the alleged falsification of business records. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Prosecutors say Cohen paid&lt;/a&gt; adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to quiet her claims of the alleged extramarital sexual encounter with Trump. Prosecutors allege the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen and fraudulently logged the payments as legal expenses, and are working to prove that Trump falsified records with the intent to commit or conceal a second crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has pleaded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;not guilty in the case&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniels took the stand last week, saying she met Trump in 2006 at Lake Tahoe during a celebrity golf tournament. She alleged that the pair had sex in Trump&apos;s hotel room during the event, which Trump has repeatedly denied in public comments. Daniels also described to the court how she got into the pornography business after working as an exotic dancer as a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal experts subsequently sounded off that Daniels’ testimony was irrelevant to the case and that some of her remarks should not have been admitted into the record. The Trump legal team twice motioned for a mistrial, but were denied by presiding Judge Juan Merchan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/may-13-trump-trial-michael-cohen-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MICHAEL COHEN EXPECTED TO TAKE THE STAND AS NY V. TRUMP TRIAL RESUMES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen has been slammed as a &quot;grifter&quot; by some critics in the lead-up to his testimony, and has been vocal in his condemnation of Trump after he no longer served as his attorney. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Trump 2024?&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/US/michael-cohen-cashing-trump-trial-tiktok-livestreams-problem/story?id=109695141&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cohen said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a TikTok video last month. &quot;More like Trump 20-24 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Judge Merchan called on New York prosecutors to instruct Cohen to stop making comments about the case and Trump ahead of taking the stand. Cohen, unlike Trump, is not under a gag order in the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/massive-trump-beach-rally-deep-blue-nj-draws-stark-contrast-bidens-beach-weekend-biden-could-never&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MASSIVE TRUMP BEACH RALLY IN DEEP-BLUE NJ DRAWS STARK CONTRAST TO BIDEN&apos;S BEACH WEEKEND: &apos;BIDEN COULD NEVER&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News contributor and constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley has called Cohen a &quot;serial perjurer&quot; who profits off the case, a sentiment that has been echoed by other legal experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Cohen has always been open as a grifter,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonathanturley.org/2024/05/09/michael-cohen-goes-on-tiktok-with-new-trump-taunt-and-announced-campaign-for-congress/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Turley recently wrote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jd-vance-slams-ny-v-trump-trial-dem-effort-distract-world-on-fire-under-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JD VANCE SLAMS NY V.

We had a rally – over a 100,000 people this weekend. A lot of the mainstream media didn&apos;t want to say how many people, they didn&apos;t want to cover. But in fact… I hear the big crowd was not shown by the mainstream media,&quot; Trump said Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Brian Flood and David Rutz contributed to this story. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

After seven years, we&apos;ll really drink,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/katy-perry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Perry said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perry, Bryan and Lionel Richie have served as judges on &quot;American Idol&quot; since the reboot of the show in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Perry confirmed during an appearance on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; that she would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/katy-perry-exits-american-idol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;exiting &quot;American Idol.&quot;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; At the time, Perry said Bryan and Richie would learn of her exit when they watched her appearance. &quot;They know that I have some things planned for this year,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After having time to digest the news, Bryan said next week&apos;s episode will be challenging. &quot;It will be emotional.

Season 21 was a media circus for Perry as she at times was booed by fans.

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nigeria’s fashion and traditional dances were on full display on Sunday as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/prince-harry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Prince Harry&lt;/a&gt; and Meghan arrived in its largest city, Lagos, as part of their three-day visit to the country to promote mental health for soldiers and empower young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple, invited to the West African nation by its military, were treated to different bouts of dancing, starting from the Lagos airport where a troupe&apos;s acrobatic moves left both applauding and grinning. One of the dancers, who looked younger than 5 years old, exchanged salutes with Harry from high up in the air, standing on firm shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going with Meghan’s white top was the traditional Nigerian aso oke, a patterned handwoven fabric wrapped around the waist and often reserved for special occasions. It was a gift from a group of women a day earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-stirs-controversy-during-nigeria-trip-wearing-dress-called-windsor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEGHAN MARKLE STIRS CONTROVERSY DURING NIGERIA TRIP BY WEARING DRESS CALLED &apos;WINDSOR&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-harry-meghan-markles-nigeria-visit-aims-keep-up-royal-image-expert-claims&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The couple&lt;/a&gt; visited a local charity – Giants of Africa — which uses basketball to empower young people. There, they were treated to another round of dancing before unveiling a partnership between the organization and their Archewell Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What you guys are doing here at Giants of Africa is truly amazing,&quot; Harry said of the group. &quot;The power of sport can change lives. It brings people together and creates community and there are no barriers, which is the most important thing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masai Ujiri, the charity’s president and an ex-NBA star, wished Meghan a happy Mother’s Day and acknowledged how hard it can be &quot;for us to be away from our kids and family to make things like this happen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To do so shows dedication (and) we truly appreciate it,&quot; he told the couple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news/meghan-markle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Meghan and Harry&lt;/a&gt; later attended a fundraiser for Nigeria’s soldiers wounded in the country’s fight against Islamic extremists and other armed groups in the country’s conflict-battered north. The event was related to Harry&apos;s Invictus Games, which Nigeria is seeking to host in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple were also hosted at the Lagos State Government House, where Meghan received another handwoven Nigerian fabric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’ve extended an additional invitation to them that they can always come back when they want to,&quot; Lagos Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Jessica Seinfeld, the wife of comedian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jerry-seinfeld-turns-70-comedian-reveals-darkening-moods-despite-monster-career&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jerry Seinfeld&lt;/a&gt;, praised her husband&apos;s &quot;amazing&quot; Duke University Class of 2024 commencement speech on Instagram over the weekend after a group of anti-Israel protesters tried to interrupt him but found themselves drowned out by the rest of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comic, who is Jewish and a co-chair of the university&apos;s Parents Committee, took the stage over the weekend to deliver remarks to a crowd of over 7,000 when the small demonstration broke out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few dozen protesters walked out of their seats, chanting &quot;Free Palestine&quot; along the way, videos of the incident show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Duke audience wouldn&apos;t have it, bursting out in chants of &quot;Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!&quot; and cheering for the comedian, video shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/duke-university-students-walk-jerry-seinfelds-commencement-speech-chant-free-palestine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DUKE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WALK OUT ON JERRY SEINFELD COMMENCEMENT SPEECH, CHANT ‘FREE PALESTINE’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Amazing crowd @dukeuniversity today where Jerry gave the commencement speech and received an honorary degree,&quot; Jessica Seinfeld wrote on her Instagram story. &quot;There was a minimal interruption – a small group of protesters walked out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They were booed by the crowd and then the stadium chanted ‘Jer-ry!’&quot; she added. &quot;Jerry&apos;s speech was amazing and the grads and their parents gave him a standing ovation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seinfeld received an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/college&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;honorary degree&lt;/a&gt; and delivered his speech without further interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university posted Seinfeld&apos;s full speech on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76QV2SrSqgo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;YouTube page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jerry-seinfeld-asks-howard-stern-forgiveness-after-suggesting-isnt-funny&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JERRY SEINFELD ASKS HOWARD STERN FOR FORGIVENESS AFTER SUGGESTING HE ISN&apos;T FUNNY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 16-minute clip, Seinfeld took a break from the jokes to give students his &quot;three real keys to life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No. 1, bust your a--,&quot; he said. &quot;No. 2, pay attention. No. 3, fall in love.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He urged the new grads to try hard and try again if they fail. Question risks and appreciate the small things in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also took a subtle swipe at wokeism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Privilege is a word that has taken quite a beating lately,&quot; he said. &quot;Privilege today seems to be the worst thing you can have. I would like to take a moment to defend it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up Jewish &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in New York&lt;/a&gt;, he said, was a privilege for an aspiring comedian. Graduating from Duke University is another privilege for the students attending his speech, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You went to Duke, that is an unbelievable privilege,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re embarrassed of things we should be proud of, and proud of things we should be embarrassed about.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You’re never going to believe this, Harvard used to be a great place to go to school,&quot; he joked. &quot;Now it&apos;s Duke.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/anti-israel-ivy-league-protests-have-prospective-students-looking-elsewhere-this-graduation-season&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Duke has emerged&lt;/a&gt; as a top U.S. university, attracting students who would be Ivy League contenders if they weren&apos;t turned off by the administrations&apos; handling of far-left campus protests, experts told Fox News Digital last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You cannot beat this school,&quot; Jessica Seinfeld concluded in her Instagram story. &quot;We are #ForeverDuke.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Only a few hundred residents remain in the embattled town of Vovchansk in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;northeast Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, where Kyiv&apos;s troops are locked in intense battles with the Russian army, according to local officials on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The town, whose pre-war population of 17,000 had dwindled to just 2,500 before Russia renewed its ground assault last week, has emerged as focus point as pitched battles engulf the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian local officials said they feared Vovchansk&apos;s fate may mirror that of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, Ukrainian cities where fierce fighting and scorched earth tactics forced Ukrainian withdrawals. Only 200-300 people remain in the town, Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Suniehubov said, as Moscow’s troops advance in an effort to surround it from three directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-beats-back-russian-attempt-cross-border-moscow-seeks-kharkiv-buffer-zone-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UKRAINE BEATS BACK RUSSIAN ATTEMPT TO CROSS BORDER AS MOSCOW SEEKS KHARKIV BUFFER ZONE: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poorly built fortifications and enduring ammunition shortages &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;enabled Russia’s&lt;/a&gt; sweeping advance in the area last week, local officials and soldiers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the span of two days, Moscow has captured some 40 square miles at least seven villages, most of them already depopulated, according to the open source monitoring project DeepState. It is a significant advance that could pin Ukrainian forces in the northeast while heavy fighting continues in the Donetsk region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Ukrainian troops were still locked in pitched battles in both regions, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Fighting is taking place near the border in eastern and northeastern Ukraine as outgunned and outnumbered Ukrainian soldiers try to hold back a significant Russian ground offensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Defensive battles are ongoing, fierce battles, on a large part of our border area,&quot; Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-lawmaker-fights-kharkiv-public-square&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UKRAINE LAWMAKER, 34, FIGHTS FOR KHARKIV IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin’s forces are aiming to exploit Ukrainian weaknesses before a big batch of new military aid for Kyiv from the U.S. and European partners arrives on the battlefield in the coming weeks and months, analysts say. That makes this period a window of opportunity for Moscow and one of the most dangerous for Kyiv in the two-year war, they say. It is unclear what of the promised aid has arrived to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Russian push in the northeastern Kharkiv region, along with the ongoing drive into the eastern Donetsk region, come after months when the roughly 620-mile front line barely budged. In the meantime, both sides have used long-range strikes to pursue what became largely a war of attrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s general staff said late Sunday that Russian forces had conducted at least 22 attacks over the previous 24 hours in two parts of the Kharkiv region and had &quot;tactical success.&quot; The statement did not elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kharkiv incursion serves likely three purposes for Russia. First, the northeast operation will pin Ukrainian forces in the region and potentially draw in precious reserves away from heavy battles in the Avdiivka and Chasiv Yar areas of the Donetsk region, where Russia’s advance has been far more significant and strategically important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelenskyy said fighting in the Donetsk area is &quot;no less intense&quot; than in Kharkiv. He said the Kremlin aimed to &quot;spread our forces thin&quot; by opening a second active front in Kharkiv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelenskyy described the area around Pokrovsk region, just inside the Ukrainian border in Donetsk, as &quot;the most difficult.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pokrovsk was a town of around 60,000 people before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense/wars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the war&lt;/a&gt; and was until recently a two-hour drive from the front line. Now it is less than half that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capture of the Donetsk city of Avdiivka in February opened a door for the Kremlin’s troops to push westward, deeper into Donetsk. Russia illegally annexed Donetsk and three other regions in 2022 shortly after it invaded Ukraine, and taking control of all of Donetsk is one of the Kremlin’s main war goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, if Ukraine isn’t able to halt Moscow’s advance, it could create future conditions for a possible attack on Kharkiv City, Ukraine’s second largest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it could create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; to protect Belgorod, where frequent Ukrainian attacks have embarrassed the Kremlin. In March, Russia announced plans to evacuate about 9,000 children from the Belgorod region because it was being shelled continuously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian emergency services on Monday finished clearing the rubble in the region’s capital city of Belgorod, where a section of a residential building collapsed following what authorities said was Ukrainian shelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen bodies were pulled from the rubble, Belgorod regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said, and 27 other people were wounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another three people in the city of Belgorod were killed by shelling late Sunday, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yevgeny Poddubny, a usually well-connected military correspondent for Russia’s state TV corporation VGTRK, said in a recent Telegram post that the Kharkiv assault marked the beginning of &quot;a new phase.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’re pushing the enemy back from the border, destroying the enemy in order to deprive the Kyiv regime of the opportunity to use relatively cheap rockets to attack Belgorod,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Caitlin Clark&apos;s race &apos;huge thing&apos; when it comes to her popularity, WNBA star says</title>
                    
                    <description>Las Vegas Aces star A&amp;apos;ja Wilson agreed there was a race element in Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark&amp;apos;s popularity as she gets ready to make her debut.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Las Vegas Aces center A’ja Wilson is a five-time All-Star and is hoping to lead her team to a third consecutive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/wnba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WNBA championship&lt;/a&gt; this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Aces’ quest for a three-peat may be flying under the radar thanks to the incoming rookie class headlined by the Indiana Fever’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/caitlin-clark-recalls-frustrating-media-storm-2023-national-championship-loss&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Caitlin Clark&lt;/a&gt;. The former Iowa star set all-time records for scoring during her senior season and led her school to back-to-back national championship appearances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with the accolades on her resume, the narrative around Clark has turned into studies and media critiques about why she is popular instead of her game lifting up women’s basketball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson, in an interview with The Associated Press, agreed there was a race element to the sharpshooter’s popularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think it’s a huge thing. I think a lot of people may say it’s not about Black and White, but to me, it is,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;It really is because you can be top-notch at what you are as a Black woman, but yet maybe that’s something that people don’t want to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They don’t see it as marketable, so it doesn’t matter how hard I work. It doesn’t matter what we all do as Black women, we’re still going to be swept underneath the rug. That’s why it boils my blood when people say it’s not about race because it is.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/fevers-caitlin-clark-draws-record-crowd-indiana-debut-pretty-unheard-of&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEVER&apos;S CAITLIN CLARK DRAWS IN RECORD CROWD FOR INDIANA DEBUT: &apos;PRETTY UNHEARD OF&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark’s endorsement deal with Nike after the WNBA Draft sparked questions about why she received one with no professional experience and Wilson did not get one despite players like Breanna Stewart and Elena Della Donne receiving a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nike announced Saturday she was getting a signature shoe. Wilson also signed an endorsement deal with Gatorade. Wilson made the comments to the AP before the deals were announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark finished her collegiate career as the Division 1 all-time leading scorer with 3,951 points. She also won the Wooden Award, Naismith Award and Women’s AP Player of the Year Award in back-to-back years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to endorsement deals, Clark had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/wnba-champion-aja-wilson-dismisses-accusations-jealous-caitlin-clark-have-no-reason-to-be&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;something Wilson&lt;/a&gt; did not coming out of college – a relationship with top companies already because of name, image and likeness (NIL). SponsorUnited’s study of NIL marketing partnerships from February 2023 to February 2024 showed that Clark already had nine brand deals and was not even in the top five of female athletes when it came to NIL deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, Angel Reese, of the Chicago Sky, and her former LSU teammate Flau’jae Johnson were in the top five. Reese had 26 NIL deals and Johnson had 18. SMU volleyball player Alex Glover had 41 NIL deals, Cameron Brink – now of the Los Angeles Sparks – had 21, as did Illinois softball player Yazzy Avila.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark has not leaned into the race debate either. Amid the on-court rivalry with Reese, Clark said in March that they were just a part of a bigger puzzle for women’s sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I would say me and Angel have always been great competitors,&quot; she said before the Elite Eight matchup. &quot;I think Angel would say the same, like it’s not just us in women’s basketball. That’s not the only competitive thing about where our game is at, and that’s what makes it so good. We need multiple people to be really good.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Philadelphia police are searching for several people they say were involved in attacking an off-duty police officer and stealing his personal firearm.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One man has been arrested and police in Philadelphia are still looking for a group of women allegedly involved in attacking an off-duty police officer and stealing his gun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assault and robbery of the officer&apos;s personal firearm happened around 7 a.m. Sunday in the 2100 block of West Oxford Street, police said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officer had disarmed his assailant while the two were engaged in a struggle and shot at him in self-defense, although it was unknown if the suspect was hit, authorities said. The officer was in the process of trying to detain his attacker when police say women interfered, allowing the man to get in a black BMW sedan and hit the officer with the vehicle while driving away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man accused in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;initial attack was arrested&lt;/a&gt; Sunday afternoon on G and Hilton streets, but the stolen firearm has not been recovered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/houston-transgender-suspect-runs-fatally-stabs-man-police&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOUSTON TRANSGENDER SUSPECT RUNS OVER, FATALLY STABS MAN: POLICE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police are now asking for the public&apos;s help identifying the women, and investigators are trying to identify multiple men for possible questioning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police officer&apos;s condition has not been released. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/video-shows-moments-deputies-fatally-shoot-man-armed-railroad-spike-florida-church&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIDEO SHOWS MOMENTS BEFORE DEPUTIES FATALLY SHOOT MAN ARMED WITH RAILROAD SPIKE AT FLORIDA CHURCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with information is asked to contact the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Philadelphia Police Department.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Comedian Jerry Seinfeld mocked Harvard University during a commencement speech at Duke University on Sunday after several anti-Israel students &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/duke-university-students-walk-jerry-seinfelds-commencement-speech-chant-free-palestine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;walked out of&lt;/a&gt; the ceremony when he was introduced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m not talking about Harvard now. I’m talking about the way it used to be. You’re never going to believe this, Harvard used to be a great place to go to school. Now it&apos;s Duke,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76QV2SrSqgo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;he said,&lt;/a&gt; noting he had a lot of Harvard graduates on his staff in the 90s who were embarrassed about attending the Ivy League school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some students chanted &quot;free Palestine&quot; while leaving the ceremony after Seinfeld, a vocal supporter of Israel, was introduced. Anti-Israel students have set up encampments at colleges across the U.S., including at Harvard University, to protest the schools&apos; investments in Israel and the Israel-Hamas war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seinfeld didn&apos;t address the protesters in his speech and focused on his message to Duke&apos;s graduates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/anti-israel-protesters-disrupt-college-commencement-ceremonies-as-campus-demonstrations-continue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIVE UPDATES: ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS DISRUPT COLLEGE COMMENCEMENT CEREMONIES AS CAMPUS DEMONSTRATIONS CONTINUE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seinfeld spoke to the graduates about his &quot;three real keys to life,&quot; which he said were, &quot;bust your a--,&quot; pay attention and fall in love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whatever you&apos;re doing, I don&apos;t care if it&apos;s your job, your hobby, a relationship, getting a reservation at M Sushi,&quot; the comedian said. &quot;Make an effort. Just pure, stupid, no-real-idea-what-I&apos;m-doing-here effort. Effort always yields a positive value, even if the outcome of the effort is absolute failure of the desired result. This is a rule of life. Just swing the bat and pray is not a bad approach to a lot of things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told the graduates to fall in love with everything they do, not just in their relationships. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fall in love with your coffee. Your sneakers. Your Blue Zone parking space. I&apos;ve had a lot of fun in life falling in love with stupid, meaningless physical objects,&quot; Seinfeld said. &quot;I have truly spent my life focusing on the smallest things imaginable, completely oblivious to all the big issues of living.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/jerry-seinfeld-defends-trip-israel-despite-intense-backlash-feelings-strong&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Seinfeld visited Israel&lt;/a&gt; in December and reportedly had an &quot;emotional&quot; meeting with the freed hostages and representatives of families whose loved ones are still held captive in Gaza, according to Israeli news outlet Haaretz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, I’m Jewish,&quot; the comedian said of his reason for visiting Israel during an interview with GQ Magazine. &quot;And you grow up learning about antisemitism, but it’s kind of in a book. It never crossed my mind that people would look at me as anything other than, ‘I like this comedian. I don’t like this comedian.’ I think most Jews of my generation never thought about antisemitism. It was from history books. And then it was something different. It was something different.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Jeffrey Clark contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The voice Alexis &quot;Lexi&quot; Bogan had before last summer was exuberant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She loved to belt out Taylor Swift and Zach Bryan ballads in the car. She laughed all the time — even while corralling misbehaving preschoolers or debating politics with friends over a backyard fire pit. In high school, she was a soprano in the chorus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then that voice was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/artificial-intelligence-helps-predict-seniors-long-term-care-needs-critical-next-steps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HELPS PREDICT SENIORS’ LONG-TERM CARE NEEDS: ‘CRITICAL NEXT STEPS’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors in August removed a life-threatening tumor lodged near the back of her brain. When the breathing tube came out a month later, Bogan had trouble swallowing and strained to say &quot;hi&quot; to her parents. Months of rehabilitation aided her recovery, but her speech is still impaired. Friends, strangers and her own family members struggle to understand what she is trying to tell them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, the 21-year-old got her old voice back. Not the real one, but a voice clone generated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/artificial-intelligence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; that she can summon from a phone app. Trained on a 15-second time capsule of her teenage voice — sourced from a cooking demonstration video she recorded for a high school project — her synthetic but remarkably real-sounding AI voice can now say almost anything she wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She types a few words or sentences into her phone and the app instantly reads it aloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hi, can I please get a grande iced brown sugar oat milk shaken espresso,&quot; said Bogan’s AI voice as she held the phone out her car’s window at a Starbucks drive-thru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-ai-tools-help-doctors-take-notes-message-patients-still-make-mistakes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW AI TOOLS CAN HELP DOCTORS TAKE NOTES, MESSAGE PATIENTS, BUT THEY STILL MAKE MISTAKES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have warned that rapidly improving AI voice-cloning technology can amplify phone scams, disrupt democratic elections and violate the dignity of people — living or dead — who never consented to having their voice recreated to say things they never spoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been used to produce deepfake robocalls to New Hampshire voters mimicking President Joe Biden. In Maryland, authorities recently charged a high school athletic director with using AI to generate a fake audio clip of the school’s principal making racist remarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bogan and a team of doctors at Rhode Island&apos;s Lifespan hospital group believe they&apos;ve found a use that justifies the risks. Bogan is one of the first people — the only one with her condition — who have been able to recreate a lost voice with OpenAI’s new Voice Engine. Some other AI providers, such as the startup ElevenLabs, have tested similar technology for people with speech impediments and loss — including a lawyer who now uses her voice clone in the courtroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’re hoping Lexi&apos;s a trailblazer as the technology develops,&quot; said Dr. Rohaid Ali, a neurosurgery resident at Brown University&apos;s medical school and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/rhode-island&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; Hospital. Millions of people with debilitating strokes, throat cancer or neurogenerative diseases could benefit, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We should be conscious of the risks, but we can’t forget about the patient and the social good,&quot; said Dr. Fatima Mirza, another resident working on the pilot. &quot;We’re able to help give Lexi back her true voice and she’s able to speak in terms that are the most true to herself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mirza and Ali, who are married, caught the attention of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI because of their previous research project at Lifespan using the AI chatbot to simplify medical consent forms for patients. The San Francisco company reached out while on the hunt earlier this year for promising medical applications for its new AI voice generator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bogan was still slowly recovering from surgery. The illness started last summer with headaches, blurry vision and a droopy face, alarming doctors at Hasbro Children&apos;s Hospital in Providence. They discovered a vascular tumor the size of a golf ball pressing on her brain stem and entangled in blood vessels and cranial nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was a battle to get control of the bleeding and get the tumor out,&quot; said pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. Konstantina Svokos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 10-hour length of the surgery coupled with the tumor&apos;s location and severity damaged Bogan&apos;s tongue muscles and vocal cords, impeding her ability to eat and talk, Svokos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s almost like a part of my identity was taken when I lost my voice,&quot; Bogan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feeding tube came out this year. Speech therapy continues, enabling her to speak intelligibly in a quiet room but with no sign she will recover the full lucidity of her natural voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At some point, I was starting to forget what I sounded like,&quot; Bogan said. &quot;I’ve been getting so used to how I sound now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever the phone rang at the family&apos;s home in the Providence suburb of North Smithfield, she would push it over to her mother to take her calls. She felt she was burdening her friends whenever they went to a noisy restaurant. Her dad, who has hearing loss, struggled to understand her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at the hospital, doctors were looking for a pilot patient to experiment with OpenAI&apos;s technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The first person that came to Dr. Svokos’ mind was Lexi,&quot; Ali said. &quot;We reached out to Lexi to see if she would be interested, not knowing what her response would be. She was game to try it out and see how it would work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bogan had to go back a few years to find a suitable recording of her voice to &quot;train&quot; the AI system on how she spoke. It was a video in which she explained how to make a pasta salad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her doctors intentionally fed the AI system just a 15-second clip. Cooking sounds make other parts of the video imperfect. It was also all that OpenAI needed — an improvement over previous technology requiring much lengthier samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also knew that getting something useful out of 15 seconds could be vital for any future patients who have no trace of their voice on the internet. A brief voicemail left for a relative might have to suffice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they tested it for the first time, everyone was stunned by the quality of the voice clone. Occasional glitches — a mispronounced word, a missing intonation — were mostly imperceptible. In April, doctors equipped Bogan with a custom-built phone app that only she can use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I get so emotional every time I hear her voice,&quot; said her mother, Pamela Bogan, tears in her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think it’s awesome that I can have that sound again,&quot; added Lexi Bogan, saying it helped &quot;boost my confidence to somewhat where it was before all this happened.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She now uses the app about 40 times a day and sends feedback she hopes will help future patients. One of her first experiments was to speak to the kids at the preschool where she works as a teaching assistant. She typed in &quot;ha ha ha ha&quot; expecting a robotic response. To her surprise, it sounded like her old laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She&apos;s used it at Target and Marshall&apos;s to ask where to find items. It&apos;s helped her reconnect with her dad. And it&apos;s made it easier for her to order fast food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bogan&apos;s doctors have started cloning the voices of other willing Rhode Island patients and hope to bring the technology to hospitals around the world. OpenAI said it is treading cautiously in expanding the use of Voice Engine, which is not yet publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of smaller AI startups already sell voice-cloning services to entertainment studios or make them more widely available. Most voice-generation vendors say they prohibit impersonation or abuse, but they vary in how they enforce their terms of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We want to make sure that everyone whose voice is used in the service is consenting on an ongoing basis,&quot; said Jeff Harris, OpenAI&apos;s lead on the product. &quot;We want to make sure that it’s not used in political contexts. So we’ve taken an approach of being very limited in who we’re giving the technology to.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris said OpenAI&apos;s next step involves developing a secure &quot;voice authentication&quot; tool so that users can replicate only their own voice. That might be &quot;limiting for a patient like Lexi, who had sudden loss of her speech capabilities,&quot; he said. &quot;So we do think that we’ll need to have high-trust relationships, especially with medical providers, to give a little bit more unfettered access to the technology.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bogan has impressed her doctors with her focus on thinking about how the technology could help others with similar or more severe speech impediments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Part of what she has done throughout this entire process is think about ways to tweak and change this,&quot; Mirza said. &quot;She’s been a great inspiration for us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While for now she must fiddle with her phone to get the voice engine to talk, Bogan imagines an AI voice engine that improves upon older remedies for speech recovery — such as the robotic-sounding electrolarynx or a voice prosthesis — in melding with the human body or translating words in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She&apos;s less sure about what will happen as she grows older and her AI voice continues to sound like she did as a teenager. Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/tech&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the technology&lt;/a&gt; could &quot;age&quot; her AI voice, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, &quot;even though I don’t have my voice fully back, I have something that helps me find my voice again,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Indonesia&amp;apos;s Mount Ibu volcano erupted for five minutes. Authorities have prepared evacuation tents nearby but have not yet ordered an evacuation.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mount Ibu, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/indonesias-ruang-volcano-spits-hot-ash-eruption-forces-schools-airports-close&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;volcano in Indonesia&apos;s North Maluku province&lt;/a&gt;, erupted on Monday, spewing thick gray ash and dark clouds 16,400 feet into the sky for five minutes, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The volcanic earthquakes are still intense so there is a potential for a future eruption,&quot; Hendra Gunawan, chief of the Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an eruption on Friday, the center raised the alert level for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxweather.com/category/volcano&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the volcano&lt;/a&gt; from 2 to 3, the second-highest level, which widens the radius of the area which should be vacated. Local authorities have prepared evacuation tents, but no evacuation order has been reported yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/11-confirmed-dead-students-indonesia-bus-crash-reported-brake-failure&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 CONFIRMED DEAD, INCLUDING STUDENTS, IN INDONESIA BUS CRASH AFTER REPORTED BRAKE FAILURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials advised residents and tourists not to conduct any activities within 3 miles of Mount Ibu&apos;s crater. More than 13,000 people live within a 3-mile radius of the northern side of the crater, Gunawan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 4,347-foot volcano is on the northwest coast of the remote island of Halmahera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, an archipelago of 270 million people, has 120 active volcanoes. It is prone to volcanic activity because it sits along the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/5717720216001&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Ring of Fire,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>What to expect from Putin as Russian strongman begins new six-year term</title>
                    
                    <description>Undeterred by the U.S.&amp;apos; unwavering support of Kyiv, Russia will likely ratchet up offensive operations against Ukraine and intensify non-kinetic confrontation with Washington.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; was inaugurated for another six-year term as president amid the worst crisis in Moscow’s relations with the West over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. During the traditionally ornate ceremony in the Kremlin, Putin called his compatriots a &quot;united and great nation&quot; and vowed to place Russia’s interests and security above anything else. Brimming with confidence, the Russian strongman punctuated his speech by declaring: &quot;Together we will overcome all obstacles. We will fulfill everything we have planned. Together we will win.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the top U.S. spy chief, DNI Avril Haines, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that the Russia-Ukraine war is &quot;unlikely to end anytime soon,&quot; warning that Putin’s &quot;aggressive tactics are likely to continue.&quot; That, despite the fact that Congress recently approved another multibillion-dollar military aid package for Ukraine to help it fight the Russians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is inside Putin’s mind at this time? Will the Russian dictator be deterred by our government’s unwavering commitment to fund Kyiv? What are his next steps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/as-someone-who-grew-up-soviet-russia-dont-let-america-turn-into-godless-nation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP IN SOVIET RUSSIA, DON&apos;T LET AMERICA TURN INTO A GODLESS NATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having examined Russia’s force posture, the state of the Russian military and economy, declared strategic goals and threat perceptions, here is what we can expect from Putin, whose thinking I’ve studied and analyzed in the course of my intelligence career. I will also note what Putin will probably not do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the Russian forces will highly likely initiate a major counteroffensive campaign in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;northeastern Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s possible that it could begin right after the Victory Day Parade, the national holiday celebrating Russia’s defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Aiming to capitalize on Ukraine’s shortages in manpower, combat hardware and ammunition, the Russians will seek to break through the front lines by or during this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make this happen, Moscow is preparing 100,000 troops to join the front lines, consistent with the decree signed by Putin in December directing the Ministry of Defense to increase the armed forces by 170,000 additional personnel to the maximum strength of 1,320,000 servicemen. Moscow is also increasing its defense spending by almost 70% in 2024 from 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin feels that the momentum is on Russia’s side theater wide, as Ukraine is outmanned and outgunned. This being said, he is almost certainly deeply concerned about a recent statement made by French President Emmanuel Macron to The Economist. Macron insinuated that he would send troops to Ukraine &quot;if the Russians were to break through the front lines, if there were a Ukrainian request.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aiming to deter NATO from deploying forces into the theater, Russia will hold military exercises involving tactical nuclear weapons. Putin personally ordered the drills to &quot;practice for the preparation and deployment for use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,&quot; according to Russia’s Ministry of Defense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Russia routinely conducts strategic nuclear exercises, announcing them in advance, the public declaration made by Moscow of non-strategic nuclear drills is unprecedented. It is intended as a strategic signaling to leaders in Washington and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/nato&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NATO commanders&lt;/a&gt; to stay out of what Russia considers its strategic security perimeter, of which Ukraine is part in Moscow’s view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Tuesday’s inauguration speech, Putin – almost certainly referring to Ukrainians living in the regions annexed by Moscow – thanked the &quot;citizens of Russia in all regions of our country, residents of our historical lands who defended the right to be together with the Motherland.&quot; Putin believes that Russia has a rightful claim to Ukraine its statehood originated from &quot;Kievan Rus,&quot; the land that is currently occupied by modern Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventy-seven percent of Russians support the actions of its military in Ukraine, effectively agreeing with Putin, according to the Levada Center. The same percentage of Russians believe that Russia will win the war. Levada is an independent polling agency designated by the Russian state as a &quot;foreign agent&quot; for expressing views that are unfavorable to the Russian government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/is-russias-putin-devout-christian-has-he-weaponized-religion-advance-personal-ambitions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IS RUSSIA’S PUTIN A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN OR HAS HE WEAPONIZED RELIGION TO ADVANCE HIS PERSONAL AMBITIONS?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, Russian intelligence services will likely ramp up their hunt for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/volodymyr-zelenskyy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to assassinate him. On Saturday, the Russian government added Zelenskyy to the list of wanted criminals. The Russian Interior Ministry justified the search warrant for the Ukrainian president by stating that is &quot;under an article of the criminal code.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelenskyy has been on the target list since the beginning of Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and has survived multiple assassination attempts. A day before Putin’s inauguration, Ukraine’s counterintelligence services reportedly disrupted a Russian covert operation aimed at infiltrating Zelenskyy’s security team and taking him hostage or killing him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has a targeted assassination program governed by the federal law, &quot;On Countering Extreme Activity,&quot; that was approved by Putin in 2002, two-and-a-half years after he assumed the presidency, and updated in 2006. This law already allows Russian intelligence services to &quot;eliminate (likvidirovat) Zelenskyy and other military and political leaders of Ukraine as ‘persons presenting a threat to the Russian state.’&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placing Zelenskyy on the &quot;wanted list&quot; sends a signal to Russian security services that capturing or killing him is a priority for the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russians will likely intensify their efforts to eliminate Zelenskyy on or after May 20, the day when his presidential term officially ends. Last November, Zelenskyy canceled the 2024 presidential election, arguing that Ukraine must concentrate all its resources on fighting Russia, which prompted Moscow to consider him illegitimate as the leader of Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, Russia will intensify its non-kinetic confrontation with Washington. While Russia fears a direct war with the U.S. and NATO, because of our superiority in conventional arms, it views the risk of the erosion of its strategic buffer zone, on which it relied for its security for centuries, even more. Washington’s continuous support provided to Ukraine has exacerbated Russia’s fears of a future conflict with NATO. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscow believes a direct kinetic U.S.-Russia war is &quot;inevitable&quot; in the long run. The Russian General Staff made this intelligence assessment based on the long-standing U.S. policy seeking to democratize Russia’s post-Soviet neighbors in Eurasia and Washington’s stated intentions to accept Ukraine into NATO, an adversarial alliance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, four Russian military aircraft breached the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), but didn’t enter U.S. airspace, according to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). Russia periodically flies strategic bombers close to our borders. These practice runs are intended to test our responses and to signal the readiness of the Russian military for a full-on war with the United States over control of the post-Soviet regions. Russian weapons systems are already capable of striking targets throughout the United States and Canada from stand-off distances – that is, without entering U.S. sovereign airspace to deliver the weapons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian intelligence services also will likely intensify their efforts to arrest U.S. citizens traveling to Russia in a effort to rattle &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Biden administration &lt;/a&gt;and to accumulate a list of candidates to trade with Washington for high-value Russian operatives held in U.S. prisons. On Tuesday, a U.S. Army soldier was detained in Vladivostok on charges of theft. Having had a number of prisoner swaps that Putin almost certainly feels were favorable to Russia, Moscow likely concluded that it can manipulate the Biden administration into giving up Russian assets valuable to Putin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, what Putin will not do is invade a NATO nation. Despite such claims made by Washington politicians, such a move would be suicidal for Putin as it would trigger NATO Article 5 Collective Defense. Putin is acutely aware of Russia’s conventional inferiority visa-a-vis NATO. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin routinely uses Russia’s nuclear trump card to intimidate the West and would likely authorize a tactical nuclear strike in the theater such as in Ukraine in certain scenarios, but those are high on the escalation ladder. But, as a rational actor, he would not intentionally pick a fight in which Russia would face the might of NATO’s entire war-fighting machine. Such a claim is illogical. It is also refuted by multiple assessments made by the U.S. intelligence community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2024 Annual Threat assessment reveals that &quot;Russia almost certainly does not want a direct military conflict with U.S. and NATO forces and will continue asymmetric activity below what it calculates to be the threshold of military conflict globally.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following excerpts from unclassified intelligence reports debunk the idea that Russia has the military and economic capacity to invade a NATO country, triggering a war with NATO: &quot;Russia has suffered more military losses than at any time since World War II – roughly 300,000 casualties and thousands of tanks and armored combat vehicles&quot; and &quot;Moscow&apos;s military forces will face a multi-year recovery after suffering extensive equipment and personnel losses during the Ukraine conflict.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same report reveals that &quot;the Russian military has and will continue to face issues of attrition, personnel shortages, and morale challenges.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/k/rebekah-koffler&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REBEKAH KOFFLER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>UN revises Gaza death toll, almost 50% less women and children killed than previously reported</title>
                    
                    <description>The United Nations suddenly adjusted its death toll count in Gaza to show that less women and children were killed, admitting widely quoted Hamas data is unreliable.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM – In a dramatic shift, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has revised its data pertaining to the number of Palestinian casualties in the seven-month-old Gaza war, reducing almost by half the number of women and children it previously said were killed in the hostilities between Israel and the Iranian-backed terror group Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to an infographic published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-day-213&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;OCHA’s daily report on May 6&lt;/a&gt;, the number of women killed in the fighting was said to be 9,500, while the organization, which admits to relying on figures from the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza, claimed that 14,500 children had been killed since the war began on Oct. 7. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days later, in its May 8 report, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-day-215&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;the U.N. agency appeared to have cut the number nearly in half&lt;/a&gt;, showing instead that some 4,959 women and 7,797 children had been killed so far in the war, which began after thousands of Hamas-led terrorists infiltrated southern Israel from Gaza, slaughtering more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 people hostage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/biden-admin-should-check-hamas-ministry-health-death-stats-expert-warns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN ADMIN SHOULD CHECK HAMAS&apos; MINISTRY OF HEALTH DEATH STATS, EXPERT WARNS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the numbers on both sides remain high – the overall death count in Gaza is said by the Hamas-controlled ministry of health to have almost reached 35,000, with more believed to be buried under the rubble of destroyed buildings – the sudden and unexplained change in numbers is alarming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamas’ death toll figures have been disputed by Israel, which claims more than a third of those killed are combatants, yet they have been widely and unquestioningly quoted by the international media, humanitarian organizations and world leaders, including President Biden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have also been used as the basis to question whether the Israeli army may have violated international humanitarian law and to accuse the Israeli government of committing genocide, or, at the very least, of deliberately targeting civilians. The Israelis estimate that around 14,000 terrorists have been killed since the fighting in Gaza began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/state-of-the-union-address&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt;, in his State of the Union address in March, quoted Hamas’s numbers, which at the time stood at 30,000. He also used the unverified data to commission a State Department inquiry into Israel’s conduct, resulting in a report that was published on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of the National Security Memorandum 20 (NSM-20), however, remained inconclusive, noting that while there were reasonable grounds to assess that Israel had &quot;used U.S. supplied weapons in instances that were inconsistent with its international obligations,&quot; there was no outright evidence that Israel had violated the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/why-mideast-neighbors-wont-offer-refuge-palestinians-stuck-gaza-war-zone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHY MIDEAST NEIGHBORS WON&apos;T OFFER REFUGE TO PALESTINIANS STUCK IN GAZA WAR ZONE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked to explain the sudden change in their statistics, Farhan Aziz Haq, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, told Fox News Digital that the breakdowns were based on data from the Ministry of Health in Gaza, and that those figures &quot;can vary based on their own verification process that they undertake.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The United Nations teams on the ground in Gaza are unable to independently verify those figures given the prevailing situation on the ground and the sheer volume of fatalities,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;It is for this reason that all figures used by the U.N. clearly cite the Health Ministry in Gaza as the source.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/bidens-arms-embargo-israel-emboldens-hamas-missile-strikes-jewish-state&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN&apos;S ARMS EMBARGO ON ISRAEL &apos;EMBOLDENS&apos; HAMAS MISSILE STRIKES AGAINST JEWISH STATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokesman said that the U.N., which also uses the unverified numbers to formulate its policies and agenda, would only be able to &quot;verify these figures to the extent possible when conditions permit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Israel has repeatedly said the numbers coming out of Gaza and which are being echoed by U.N. agencies are being manipulated by Hamas, are not accurate, and do not reflect the reality on the ground,&quot; an Israeli official told Fox News Digital. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The official said Israel was still waiting for OCHA to acknowledge that an incident at a hospital early on in the war that killed nearly 100 civilians was actually caused by an errant rocket fired by one of the Gaza terror groups and to recognize that Hamas uses U.N. infrastructure for its terror activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All of these are consistently ignored in OCHA’s reports,&quot; the official said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Parroting Hamas propaganda messages without any verification process has proven time and again as methodologically flawed and unprofessional,&quot; the official added. &quot;We urge the international community to use more than a grain of salt when evaluating OCHA reports.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Adesnik, a senior fellow and director of research at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies who has been tracking the death toll data closely &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/hamas-sexual-violence-oct-7-revealed-new-documentary-world-needs-see-happened&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;since Oct. 7&lt;/a&gt;, told Fox News Digital that while early on in the war the claim that Hamas’ figures could be accepted because in previous conflicts they were fairly accurate, the current chaos in the Palestinian enclave and the total collapse of the health system there has made counting the dead and verifying Hamas’ reports impossible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;U.N. agencies have consistently shown they prefer to trust the numbers coming out of Hamas-controlled sources rather than doing basic due diligence,&quot; he said, adding that the U.N.’s sudden revision last week of the death toll most likely indicated that &quot;even Hamas-controlled sources have begun admitting that their numbers are based on incomplete data.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They [Hamas] don&apos;t even have the names of more than 10,000 of the individuals they count as dead,&quot; Adesnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change by the U.N., he said, was &quot;a step forward for the U.N., even though it still has a long way to go, as do Western journalists, who are often the most vocal defenders of the numbers from Hamas-controlled sources.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/world-health-organization-silent-hamas-use-gaza-hospital-terror-hq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SILENT OVER HAMAS’ USE OF GAZA HOSPITAL AS TERROR HQ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous interview with Fox News Digital, John Spencer, chair of Urban Warfare Studies Modern War Institute at West Point and an author of multiple books on the subject of urban warfare, said that in contrast to claims from Western leaders, including Biden, the &quot;steps that Israel has taken to prevent casualties is historic in comparison to all these other wars.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Despite the numbers, Israel is setting the bar very high on civilian harm mitigation steps,&quot; Spencer, who is also host of the Urban Warfare Project podcast and serves as the chair of Urban Warfare Studies at the New York-based Madison Policy Forum, told Fox News Digital in February. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He outlined how the Israeli military took measures that no other military, including the U.S., had previously taken during war such as calling and texting individuals to warn them of a forthcoming air strike and sharing maps with plans for military maneuvers in certain areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden, last week, threatened to halt some armaments deliveries to Israel if it decides to launch a full scale military offensive in the Strip’s southernmost city of Rafah, a maneuver Israel says is essential in order to wipe out the remaining &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-debunks-hamas-libels-mass-grave-spread-media-internet-clicks-netanyahu-spokesman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hamas battalions &lt;/a&gt;and end the war. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Situated on the border with Egypt, Israel believes that most of Hamas’ top leadership is hiding in Rafah, shielded by more than 1.4 million civilians, many of whom fled the fighting in other parts of the Palestinian enclave. Israel also believes that many of the remaining 132 hostages are being held there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, the Israel Defense Forces said it had begun precise military operations in the area of eastern Rafah, after urging more than 300,000 Gazans to move into humanitarian safe zones away from the fighting. On Sunday, the army said in a statement that its troops operating in Rafah had located and dismantled a number of tunnel shafts and rocket launchers, which were used to fire towards Israel, including the crossing used to transport humanitarian aid into the Strip.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Rhode Island clear-broth clam chowder offers taste of the sea, Native tradition</title>
                    
                    <description>Rhode Island clear-broth clam chowder is a local culinary tradition that traces its roots to Native Americans who prepared seafood stew before the arrival of cows and creams.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Creamy white New England &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;clam chowder&lt;/a&gt; is the most famous.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood-splatter red Manhattan clam chowder is the most reviled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet salty clear-broth &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/rhode-island&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; clam chowder &quot;is the original chowder,&quot; says Jamie Coelho, editor-in-chief of Rhode Island Monthly magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/meet-american-who-created-bubble-gum-walter-diemer-home-kitchen-chemist-outwitted-scientists&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEET THE AMERICAN WHO CREATED BUBBLE GUM, WALTER DIEMER, HOME-KITCHEN CHEMIST OUTWITTED SCIENTISTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The indigenous tribes of Rhode Island gathered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/cuisines/seafood&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;quahogs to eat&lt;/a&gt;, long before the colonists arrived, and used them to make chowder.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a pretty good reason that Native Americans didn’t make creamy chowder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They didn’t have cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animals are not native to North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They arrived in the Americas only with European settlers after the Columbus explorations. Indigenous people had no domesticated livestock. Dairy was not common in their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/common-cooking-ingredient-could-reduce-dementia-mortality-risk-study&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMMON COOKING INGREDIENT COULD REDUCE DEMENTIA MORTALITY RISK, STUDY SUGGESTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clear-broth Rhode Island clam chowder is no less delicious than its more common creamy counterpart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly healthier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of cream, Rhode Island-style chowder is made with clam broth — which is nothing more than salty ocean water — but often stretched with seafood or chicken stock or beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaty Rhode Island quahogs are the star of the stew. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quahogs are large hard-shell clams with dense, flavorful meat. The shellfish grow abundantly in the Ocean State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The species is found across coastal North America. The word quahog comes from the Ocean State’s native Narragansett people — also the name of a beautiful seaside town with world-class seafood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/rise-rhubarb-vegetable-acts-like-fruit-sure-sign-spring-swing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RISE OF RHUBARB, THE VEGETABLE THAT ACTS LIKE A FRUIT, ‘A SURE SIGN’ SPRING IN SWING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhode Island clam chowder typically includes fresh herbs such as dill, while potatoes are common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coelho cites Sherry Pocknett, the chef-owner of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/restaurants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sly Fox Den Too&lt;/a&gt;, in Charlestown, as the state&apos;s best repository of its indigenous cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A member of the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe, she won the prestigious 2023 James Beard Award as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/celebrity-chefs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Best Chef&lt;/a&gt; in the Northeast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Quahog chowder,&quot; Pocknett told Coelho in an interview last year, &quot;is a Mashpee Wampanoag recipe made with quahog clams, potatoes, onions and ground black peppercorn in a broth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quahog remains an iconic Rhode Island culinary and cultural idiom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quahog, Rhode Island is the name of the fictional town featured in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/sitcom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;animated sitcom&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Family Guy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhode Island&apos;s clear-broth chowder reflects the state’s deep and close connection &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/environment/oceans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;with the ocean&lt;/a&gt; and its prized quahogs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Rhody is the smallest state in the union, a mere 1,214 square miles in area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorists zip down Interstate 95 across the entire state in just 45 minutes, from Massachusetts to Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tiny state enjoys a sprawling 400 miles of coastline, however, cleaved into an East Bay and a West Bay by Narragansett Bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smell and taste of the sea is never far away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&apos;s right there on the table. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
