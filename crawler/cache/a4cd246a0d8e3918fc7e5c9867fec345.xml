                    <title>FBI interrogates Americans over social media posts &apos;every day, all day long,&apos; agent says</title>
                    
                    <description>FBI agents told an Oklahoma woman that they spend &amp;quot;every day, all day long&amp;quot; interrogating people about social media activity when they arrived at her home in response to her posts.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/fbi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;FBI agents&lt;/a&gt; told an Oklahoma woman that the agency spends &quot;every day, all day long&quot; questioning people about their social media posts when they arrived at her house to ask about posts she made online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rolla Abdeljawad, of Stillwater, was told by FBI agents who showed up at her home on Wednesday that Facebook had handed over screenshots of her posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdeljawad told the agents she did not want to talk and asked them to show their badges on camera, but the agents refused, video posted to the social media platform X by her lawyer, Hassan Shibly, shows. The woman wrote on Facebook that she later confirmed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;local police&lt;/a&gt; that the people who showed up at her home were actually FBI agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Facebook gave us a couple of screenshots of your account,&quot; one agent wearing a gray shirt was heard saying in the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-slam-200-million-funding-new-fbi-hq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOUSE REPUBLICANS SLAM $200 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR NEW FBI HQ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdeljawad replied, &quot;So we no longer live in a free country, and we can&apos;t say what we want?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, we totally do,&quot; another agent wearing a red shirt said. &quot;That&apos;s why we&apos;re not here to arrest you or anything. We do this every day, all day long. It&apos;s just an effort to keep everybody safe and make sure nobody has any ill will.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman then said, &quot;All I&apos;ve done is exercise my right as an American citizen on a public social media platform with my personal opinions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear which posts caught the attention of the FBI, but Abdeljawad has made a series of posts in the past week expressing frustration about the ongoing war in Gaza between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists, including referring to Israel as &quot;Israhell.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Israhelli terrorist filth,&quot; she said in one post. &quot;They think Ramadan is a weakness for Muslims not, realizing Ramadan is the strength. #FreePalestine May Allah destroy every single despicable zionist, their supporters and backers. Ameen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdeljawad&apos;s Facebook timeline is also public, meaning the FBI agents could have accessed her posts themselves without requesting screenshots from Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/former-fbi-agent-accused-revenge-porn-hidden-cameras-could-have-upwards-80-victims-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORMER FBI AGENT ACCUSED OF &apos;REVENGE PORN&apos; WITH HIDDEN CAMERAS COULD HAVE UPWARDS OF 80 VICTIMS: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her posts even warned the Muslim community and people who are pro-Palestinian to be wary of the U.S. government monitoring their activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don&apos;t fall for their games. Our community is being watched &amp;amp; they are just waiting for any reason to round us up,&quot; Abdeljawad wrote on March 24. &quot;If you&apos;re Muslim and/or pro-pal consider all your media accounts, Google searches, mail, messenger, local mosques &amp;amp; political events monitored. #NYC #usa #PoliceState #FreePalestine&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official policy of Meta, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Facebook&apos;s parent company&lt;/a&gt;, is to give law enforcement Facebook data following a court order, subpoena, search warrant or emergency situation involving &quot;imminent harm to a child or risk of death or serious physical injury to any person.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first half of 2023, the social media giant received nearly 74,000 requests from law enforcement and handed over data 88% of the time, according to Meta&apos;s website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdeljawad said in a post on Thursday that her lawyer does not believe Facebook sent the FBI the screenshots of her posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rather, it seems like a fishing expedition,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I do not fear them. My only concern as, I told the cop is that, someone in my state will do something or that they would and then use my posts in a malicious attempt to &apos;smear&apos; me. Just *remember, I am a Muslim, an obligated protector of creation. I enjoin what is good and forbid what is wrong.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shibly said in the caption on the social media video that Abdeljawad made the correct decision to refuse to speak without a lawyer, to not allow them in her house and to record the interaction. But, he says, she should not have gone outside her house to talk to the agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You have the right never to speak to the FBI without a lawyer,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Duke menâ€™s basketball outlasted top-seeded Houston on Friday night to advance to the Elite Eight where they will face ACC rival North Carolina State.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/duke-blue-devils&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Duke menâ€™s basketball&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is back in the Elite Eight after outlasting a physical Houston with a 54-51 win in the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA menâ€™s basketball tournament on Friday night.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Houstonâ€™s top-ranked defense kept Duke at bay in the first half, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/houston-cougars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Cougars&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suffered a tough blow when All-American guard Jamal Shead went down with an apparent foot injury while driving towards the basket with just a little over six minutes left in the half.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After remaining on the ground visibly in pain, Shead was helped up and eventually walked back to the locker room.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to reports, his X-rays came back negative, and he was diagnosed with a severely sprained right ankle. He would remain on the sidelines for the rest of the game.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But without Shead, Duke managed to pull away in the second half.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyle Filipowski had 16 points and nine rebounds to lead the charge, but Jeremy Roach&apos;s 14 second-half points kept the momentum going.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Iâ€™m really proud of these guys and really proud of the game tonight â€“ that was a big time &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;college basketball&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; game,&quot; Duke head coach Jon Scheyer said after the game.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nc-states-cinderella-story-continues-as-underdog-wolfpack-knockoff-marquette-to-reach-elite-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NC STATE&apos;S CINDERELLA STORY CONTINUES, AS UNDERDOG WOLFPACK KNOCKOFF MARQUETTE TO REACH ELITE 8&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheyer went on to compliment Houstonâ€™s fortitude despite the loss of Shead, and made a point to silence any criticisms about Dukeâ€™s own toughness after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/tennessee-volunteers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;a loss to Tennessee&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the second round last year.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look, we started four freshmen last year,&quot; he began, &quot;I think for us, some of the criticism about toughness or whatever â€“ try being at Duke as a freshman or sophomore and battling your ass off in the tournament, and then talk to me about being tough.&quot;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duke now moves on to face Atlantic Coast Conference rival North Carolina State for a spot in the Final Four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.Â &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digitalâ€™s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>NC State&apos;s Cinderella story continues, as underdog Wolfpack knockoff Marquette to reach Elite 8</title>
                    
                    <description>The NC State men&amp;apos;s basketball team may have played in the ACC and won national titles in the past, but being an eleventh seed still certainly makes them a Cinderella story.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the number of underdogs in this year&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk/march-madness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NCAA Division I men&apos;s basketball tournament&lt;/a&gt; continues to dwindle, the North Carolina State Wolfpack are doing their part to keep the magic alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The No. 11 Wolfpack knocked off the second-seeded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/marquette-golden-eagles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Marquette Golden Eagles&lt;/a&gt; on Friday night. The 67-58 win lifted NC State to the Elite Eight for the first time since 1986. The Wolfpack had to put together a string of wins in the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament just to qualify for the big dance.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NC State has now won eight straight games since the start of the ACC tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Itâ€™s magical, but Iâ€™m going to say we knew this from day one,&quot; said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/north-carolina-state-wolfpack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NC State&apos;s DJ Horne&lt;/a&gt;, whose team lost seven of nine to finish the regular season. &quot;We knew we were a good team. It was all a matter of just locking in and understanding our roles, and no better time to be doing that than now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/clemson-stuns-arizona-survives-second-half-surge-reach-elite-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLEMSON STUNS ARIZONA, SURVIVES SECOND-HALF SURGE TO REACH ELITE 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NC State awaits the winner of the highly-anticipated matchup between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/houston-cougars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;top-seeded Houston&lt;/a&gt; or No. 4 seed Duke on Sunday for a spot in the Final Four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time the Wolfpack went that far 41 years ago, they had to win the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ACC Tournament&lt;/a&gt; before the late Jim Valvano sprinted around the court trying to find someone to hug after a still-talked-about upset of high-flying Houston for the title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Golden Eagles couldnâ€™t overcome an unsightly shooting performance in their first trip to the Sweet 16 since 2013. They went 4 of 31 (12.9%) from 3-point range and shot 33.3% overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We talked about being very stingy defensively,&quot; NC State coach Keatts said. &quot;Marquetteâ€™s a really good basketball team.

                    <title>Top UK health official urges against eating whole Easter egg in &apos;one go&apos; hit with backlash: &apos;Life too short&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>After a director for England&amp;apos;s National Health Service warned about eating a whole chocolate Easter egg in &amp;quot;one go,&amp;quot; doctors took to social media to tell people that, &amp;quot;life is too short&amp;quot; to not eat the whole egg.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After a top &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;England&apos;s National Health Service&lt;/a&gt; (NHS) director warned people &quot;not to eat the whole Easter egg in one go,&quot; doctors hit back, saying that &quot;life is too short&quot; to cut back this holiday season.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a blog post, Dr Andrew Kelso, a NHS medical director, advised people to watch their waistline and show constraint when it comes to chocolate treats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I urge people to enjoy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/easter-god-love-should-not-be-domesticated-bishop-robert-barron&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;their Easter eggs&lt;/a&gt; in moderation,&quot; Kelso said. &quot;Enjoy your sweet treats but donâ€™t overdo it.&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Â &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/reddit-user-left-drunk-husband-airport-support-others-problem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REDDIT USER WHO LEFT HER DRUNK HUSBAND BEHIND AT AIRPORT GETS SUPPORT FROM OTHERS: â€˜HAS A PROBLEMâ€™&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The top doctor&lt;/a&gt; said that his warning was timely due to an increase in obesity, Type 2 diabetes and tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/holy-week-leads-faithful-easter-sunday-special-days-observed-what-they-mean&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HOLY WEEK LEADS THE FAITHFUL TO EASTER SUNDAY: HERE ARE THE SPECIAL DAYS OBSERVED AND WHAT THEY MEAN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Many people donâ€™t realize that an average Easter egg contains around three-quarters of an adultâ€™s recommended &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/how-many-calories-do-you-actually-need-per-day&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;daily calorie intake&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; Kelso said.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At a time like this when we are seeing significant increases in cases of obesity and Type 2 diabetes, as well as tooth decay, I urge people to enjoy their Easter eggs in moderation and resist the urge to eat a whole egg in one go,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the top doctor&apos;s advice, others in&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/health-care&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; the medical community&lt;/a&gt; were quick to advise the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m an intensive care doctor. Life is short. Eat the Easter egg,&quot; @madbusymum wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Iâ€™m a dentist,&quot; @wendythedentist replied. &quot;Eat the Easter egg all at once!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Iâ€™m an Intensive Care Nurse.

He adds, &quot;Cowards! Go chase the money! You money suckers!&quot;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6349766278112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN HECKLED BY PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTER DURING HEALTHCARE SPEECH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The council shared the videos on X, writing: &quot;Yesterday, the Berkeley City Council held its final meeting before a one-month recess. The agenda of the meeting included an item on marking Holocaust Remembrance Day and funding educational programs around this commemoration. There was nothing on the meeting agenda about the Israel-Hamas War. Demonstrators called Jews â€˜Zionist pigs,â€™ intimidated a Holocaust survivor, stole and threw a Jewish man&apos;s phone toward the dais and implied city council members were being bought by the Jewish community. Warning: Explicit language.&quot;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pro-palestinian-protest-breaks-out-inside-senate-office-building-interrupts-interview-cease-fire-chants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTER BREAKS OUT INSIDE SENATE OFFICE BUILDING, INTERRUPTS INTERVIEW WITH CEASE-FIRE CHANTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters also repeatedly shouted &quot;Lies!&quot; while 89-year-old Holocaust survivor Susanne DeWitt urged the City Council to adopt the Holocaust Remembrance Day proclamation because of a &quot;horrendous surge in antisemitism.&quot;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protesters constantly interrupted DeWitt as she addressed the council and spoke about 1,200 Israelis being killed by Hamas and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/hamas-terrorists-systematically-intentionally-committed-sexual-violence-oct-7-attack-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;women being &quot;tortured and raped.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeWitt was taken to the Dachau Concentration Camp when she was 4 years old, the JCRC said.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stop heckling,&quot; DeWitt said, turning around to the protesters in the room as the moderator tried to quiet them. &quot;Stop lying!&quot; a protester replied. Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a Zionist stronghold,&quot; another protester claimed later, pointing to council members. &quot;The city of Berkeley, the people of Berkeley love Palestine.&quot;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protest comes as The University of California, Berkeley campus has been inundated with Pro-Palestinian protests and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/anti-semitism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; concerns about antisemitism&lt;/a&gt; at the school have risen since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, after Hamas terrorists&apos; unprovoked attack on the country in October.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, pro-Palestinian protesters disrupted an Israeli &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/jewish-students-uc-berkeley-fight-campus-antisemitism-not-hiding-anymore&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;soldier&apos;s speaking event&lt;/a&gt; at Berkeley&apos;s campus, screaming slurs like at Jewish attendees.Â &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Braves manager Brian Snitker&apos;s family skips opening day trip to Philadelphia due to &apos;hostile crowd&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Philadelphia might be the City of Brotherly Love, but Braves skipper Brian Snitker made sure his family and some friends weren&amp;apos;t inside the Phillies&amp;apos; ballpark for opening day.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brian Snitker has spent nearly four decades with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/atlanta-braves&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt;. During that time, he has become well-versed in what it takes to handle the Philadelphia Phillies crowds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snitker recently spoke about the way some of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/philadelphia-phillies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Phillies&apos;&lt;/a&gt; fans treated his family and friends during last season&apos;s NL Division Series. Snitker said some of the fan behavior had him concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Itâ€™s rough there,&quot; Snitker said in an interview with Atlanta radio station WZGC last week. &quot;And they donâ€™t seem to mind, either, quite honestly. It was rough on them all last year to the point where it was concerning.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Braves won the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 and have taken the NL East crown six years in a row. But the Phillies have had the Braves&apos; number recently in the postseason. Philadelphia has qualified for the playoffs as a wild-card team over the past couple of years, knocking out Atlanta back-to-back years in an NLDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tensions-boil-mets-brewers-opening-day-game-rhys-hoskins-slide-jeff-mcneil&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TENSIONS BOIL IN METS-BREWERS OPENING DAY GAME AFTER RHYS HOSKINS&apos; SLIDE INTO JEFF MCNEIL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Phillies&apos; Citizens Bank Park celebrates its 20-year anniversary this season. It has become known as one of the loudest and most hostile environments for opposing teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snitker said Philly had &quot;by far the most hostile crowd,&quot; and his wife would refuse to return to the Phillies&apos; ballpark.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked what made his family feel unsafe at the ballpark, Snitker responded by saying, &quot;Iâ€™m not going to get into all that. Letâ€™s talk about today.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My wifeâ€™s babysitting, and the grandkids are in school,&quot; Snitker said in Atlantaâ€™s dugout. &quot;They wouldnâ€™t be anywhere, honestly, other than home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a passionate fan base, and thereâ€™s a lot of energy in the air, and rightly so,&quot; Snitker said. &quot;This is a really good club. These fans are passionate about what they do. Itâ€™s a fun place to come play, quite honestly, because there is a lot of energy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snitker brushed off nearly 45,000 booing fans and broke out a wide smile and laughed as he jogged to the third base line during lineup introductions ahead of Atlantaâ€™s 9-3 win over the Phillies on opening day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They donâ€™t boo nobodies,&quot; Braves star pitcher Spencer Strider said. &quot;Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been told. I like playing here. Itâ€™s a fun place to play. Thereâ€™s passionate fans and a good team on the other side of the field. Usually it leads to a good game.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digitalâ€™s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>NFL Draft prospect Jayden Daniels puts elbow concerns to rest after strange photo goes viral</title>
                    
                    <description>Highly touted NFL Draft prospect Jayden Daniels put concerns about his elbow to rest after a photo of him throwing went viral this week.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels could be one of the first quarterbacks off the board next month in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl-draft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NFL Draft,&lt;/a&gt; and heâ€™s already turning heads on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFL fans were quick to wonder about Daniels after a picture of his throwing arm went viral. Fans focused on the way his elbow looked as he threw in a few photos.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pictures appeared to show Danielsâ€™ elbow protruding outward and away from the rest of his arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Daniels cleared up any misconceptions about his elbow on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;my elbow is perfectly fine .. stop the cap (lies)!!&quot; he wrote on the social media platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1773012995896926413&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW THE POST ON X.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of NFL teams that will be searching for a quarterback early in the first round, and Daniels is among the favorites to be selected within the top five.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFL Networkâ€™s Bucky Brooks has Daniels going No. 2 to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/washington-commanders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Washington Commanders&lt;/a&gt;. Even Brian Kelly believed it too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-andy-reid-impresses-perfect-ceremonial-first-pitch-royals-opening-day&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHIEFS&apos; ANDY REID IMPRESSES WITH PERFECT CEREMONIAL FIRST PITCH AT ROYALS&apos; OPENING DAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He&apos;s going to be so committed to taking care of himself that you&apos;re not going to have to worry about size or [if] he doesn&apos;t weigh enough,&quot; Kelly said Wednesday, via CBS Sports. &quot;Lamar (Jackson) has done a pretty good job with his size. (Patrick) Mahomes â€” I wouldn&apos;t consider him a giant. Because he (Daniels) is going to get the ball out to the playmakers and make plays. For Washington.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Tigers star was the 2023 Heisman Trophy winner. He threw for 3,812 yards, 40 touchdowns and only four interceptions last season. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/lsu-tigers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;LSU finished&lt;/a&gt; the season 10-3 as Garrett Nussmeier replaced Daniels to win the ReliaQuest Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All eyes will be on Daniels when April 25 arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digitalâ€™s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News host Jesse Watters discusses the latest developments into the investigation of Rapper Sean &apos;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-declares-innocence-after-federal-agents-raid-his-homes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Diddy&lt;/a&gt;&apos; Combs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JESSE WATTERS:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;i&gt;We found Diddy, the disgraced billionaire hip hop mogul and Democratic Party community organizer, was spotted for the first time since having his homes raided in a major sex trafficking investigation similar to Jeffrey Epstein&apos;s. They say he was seen swinging clubs at a Topgolf in Miami with his daughters. He may look relaxed, but behind the scenes there&apos;s panic. TMZ reporting tonight that the federal case against him is expanding, as prosecutors from the Southern District of New York have been dishing out subpoenas to multiple corporations tied to the mogul, like cell phone providers and computer companies. At the same time, Diddy&apos;s been unloading his assets. The timing not coincidental. Selling off his stake in Revolt TV and returning music rights from Bad Boy Records. TMZ reporting the feds slapping subpoenas on Diddy&apos;s chartered jets. Now, sources say even commercial airlines will be subpoenaed, possibly the FAA, as investigators look for anyone who flew on Diddy&apos;s dime. They&apos;re not only looking for victims, they&apos;re looking for witnesses. People with unfettered access to Diddy&apos;s alleged crimes and freak off parties. Some inside of Diddy&apos;s world have already started talking. Diddy&apos;s former bodyguard says he&apos;ll go on the stand.Â &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rapper-sean-diddy-combs-prolific-supporter-democrats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAPPER SEAN â€˜DIDDYâ€™ COMBS HAS BEEN A PROLIFIC SUPPORTER OF DEMOCRATS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;â€¦&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;With subpoenas raining down, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rapper-sean-diddy-combs-homes-raided-homeland-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Diddy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&apos;s inner circle is getting squeezed. His alleged drug mules already been handcuffed. Diddy&apos;s ex-girlfriend Young Miami, who allegedly transported his pink cocaine on private jets, she&apos;s feeling the heat. The question investigators are looking to answer is who else was involved? As Primetime reported yesterday, the feds seized all of Diddy&apos;s surveillance footage in addition to hard drives and phones. They want to know who was in and out of Diddy&apos;s planes and his homes. As Little Rod&apos;s lawsuit alleges, they weren&apos;t just up-and-coming artists. These were celebrities, politicians, athletes, international dignitaries and music label executives, all captured on camera in Diddy&apos;s compounds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Michael Rapaport skewers The Squad as &apos;dangerous&apos; &apos;race hustlers:&apos; &apos;Totally full of s---&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Actor Michael Rapaport explained in an interview that multiple political problems have soured his view on the Democratic Party and made him lean towards voting for Trump.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Comedian and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/comedian-michael-rapaport-excoriates-pro-palestinian-college-students-stop-wasting-money&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;pro-Israel advocate Michael Rapaport&lt;/a&gt; shredded what the modern Democratic Party has become and explained why he is increasingly considering voting for Trump in a new interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a series about the Israel-Hamas conflict that rages in the Middle East, an interviewer from Visegrad24 spoke to Rapaport on the shores of an Israeli beach and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwFe_dieezg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Have your political views shifted? Youâ€™ve been a very vocal anti-Trump - probably the most vocal anti-Trump celebrity out there. Have your views shifted? I mean, a lot of Israelis are very supportive of Donald Trump, right?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapaport explained that his views have radically shifted toward the former president, particularly amid the war in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In all honesty, I have educated myself so much since 2016, and I have a ways to go. My political views have changed immensely and they&apos;re changing at a rapid pace,&quot; he said. &quot;I will not vote for Joe Biden. I do not support anybody from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/the-squad&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Squad,&lt;/a&gt; I think they&apos;re totally full of s---, I think they&apos;re dangerous, I think they&apos;re race hustlers, I think they&apos;re cons, I think inevitably they want to get themselves production deals to produce documentaries, I think they&apos;re three-card monte-playing bulls--- artists, I think they totally have an agenda.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-rapaport-blasts-golden-globe-attendees-not-mentioning-israeli-hostages-should-ashamed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL RAPAPORT BLASTS GOLDEN GLOBE ATTENDEES FOR NOT MENTIONING ISRAELI HOSTAGES: &apos;WE SHOULD BE ASHAMED&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also reiterated a claim he has made in the past, &quot;I have said, you know, not to go down the rabbit hole - that at this point, when we&apos;re doing this interview, voting for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/far-left-comic-michael-rapaport-says-voting-trump-table-after-seeing-illegals-beat-nypd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trump is on the table.&lt;/a&gt;&quot;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapaport explained that when people question him about this, he can cite concrete reasons that stem from modern political realities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People are like â€˜What are you talking about?â€™ That&apos;s my reality, that is my reality. I will not support anybody who&apos;s anti-Israel,&quot; adding he is also against anybody who is against &quot;making America safe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also juxtaposed Americaâ€™s open border with strict airport security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/left-wing-actor-goes-viral-vulgar-rant-trump-courtroom-sketch&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LEFT-WING ACTOR GOES VIRAL FOR VULGAR RANT OVER TRUMP COURTROOM SKETCH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actor also declared, &quot;I&apos;m not supporting anybody that is cool with the fact that it takes me 2 and a half hours to get back into America from Toronto,&quot; due to passport control, &quot;as it should,&quot; while on the other hand, &quot;it takes you two minutes to cross the border, I&apos;m not down with that sâ€”t.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapaport also referred to a viral video he filmed where a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/michael-rapaport-films-robbery-new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;man appeared to shoplift&lt;/a&gt; bags full of items from a Rite-Aid in New York, slamming the idea that somebody can nonchalantly steal and then calmly exit, &quot;walking like youâ€™re on a beautiful spring day walk.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He concluded, &quot;Iâ€™m not down with any of that s---, so any of these people that support it, I&apos;m not voting for them. So, yes, my political views have changed a lot. I&apos;m voting with my money, and I&apos;m voting with Israel. I&apos;m not getting caught up or suckered into these race politics or any of that bulls--- anymore. Yeah, they have changed, and they&apos;re going to continue to change and evolve. It&apos;s a crazy time in American politics.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Georgia House and Senate showcase contrasting priorities as 2024 session ends</title>
                    
                    <description>The 2024 legislative session in Georgia showcased contrasting priorities between the House and Senate, with minority Democrats unable to leverage those differences.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA (AP) â€” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-immigration-bill-compel-law-enforcement-work-federal-officials-goes-gov-kemp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Georgia&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; 2024 legislative session again showcased contrasting Republican approaches to governing, while minority Democrats couldn&apos;t leverage those differences to advance top policy priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while many GOP initiatives in the state Senate seemed like appeals to that party&apos;s primary voters, Republicans are hoping tax cuts and a harder line on immigration will carry them to victory in November&apos;s legislative races. Democrats walked away more furious than ever about the failure to expand Medicaid health insurance, one cornerstone of their campaign to make gains in the state House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-appeals-georgia-court-order-that-keeps-fani-willis-on-the-case-should-have-been-disqualified&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP APPEALS GEORGIA COURT ORDER THAT KEEPS FANI WILLIS ON THE CASE: &apos;SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISQUALIFIED&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the background of 2024 campaigns for all 236 state legislative seats is jockeying for elections to statewide office in 2026. Republican Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, displaying a conservative edge, seems more likely than ever to run to succeed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-governor-brian-kemp-demands-answers-from-president-biden-laken-riley-killers-immigration-status&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Gov. Brian Kemp&lt;/a&gt;, as many GOP lawmakers try to satisfy an activist base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some issues unified Republicans, including speeding up an income tax cut, uniting around a crackdown on undocumented immigrants in jails, and pay raises for teachers and state employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there&apos;s a continuing power struggle between the chambers. Last year, that conflict burst into the open, with House and Senate leaders killing bills from the other chamber in a dispute that was set off by Jones&apos; push to loosen health care permitting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones won a partial loosening of those rules this year, and conflict overall was less public. But sharp disagreements were evident as each chamber completely disregarded measures passed by the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You know, some folks choose politics. The House chooses results,&quot; Republican House Speaker Jon Burns of Newington told reporters moments after the House adjourned at 12:58 a.m. Friday. He and other House leaders said they instead focused on &quot;kitchen table&quot; issues often funded through the budget, like a spending boost for prekindergarten programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Divisions showed in how, even more than normal, decisions cascaded into the last hours of the last legislative day. Both the House and Senate blew past a once-sacrosanct midnight deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There were a lot of challenges and tensions between the two chambers. Itâ€™s not the first time, but it was particularly elevated this year.&quot; said Rep. Scott Holcomb. The Atlanta Democrat again saw the Senate snub his push to compensate people released from prison after they are exonerated, even though top House Republicans supported the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was far from the only initiative that failed. The Senate spent precious time on the session&apos;s last day passing a ban on puberty blocking drugs for transgender youth, but the bill sank without a trace in the House. So did an education bill that sought to cut back on sex education and write a ban on transgender girls playing girls&apos; sports into law, as well as a Senate bill banning public money from being spent on what Republican senators say is the left-wing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/judy-blume-american-library-association-win-national-book-critics-circle-awards&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;American Library Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To me, the 2024 session was a battle of the far-right Senate versus the moderate Republican House, in which the House ultimately prevailed by stopping the vast majority of these culture war issues, from attacks against transgender youth to putting a Clarence Thomas monument on the Capitol grounds,&quot; House Minority Whip Sam Park, a Lawrenceville Democrat, said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on some other terms, the Senate may the winner. All of the priorities the Senate Republican Caucus announced in January became law. That included a bill requiring cash bail for more crimes, and a call for private and home school vouchers that finally passed the House after Kemp and House leaders joined the push. A Senate-backed bill requiring parental consent before children younger than 16 can sign up for social media is also on the way to Kemp&apos;s desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m proud of all that the Senate accomplished this session, promoting an agenda to help Georgia families, expand access to health care, support HBCUs, crack down on sanctuary policies and protect women&apos;s sports,&quot; Jones said in a statement Friday. &quot;These issues are a marathon, not a sprint, and we&apos;ll continue to build on our accomplishments year after year to enact policies that lift up the middle class and fight back against radical Democrats&apos; insanity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Democrats, though, it was another year of frustration. After Burns opened the door to Medicaid expansion, the minority party worked feverishly to try to expand health coverage to lower-income adults. They even believed they had a deal with Senate leadership to bring forward a bill at the last minute, only to claim betrayal after it was voted down in committee by Republicans who said they wanted to support Kemp&apos;s struggling Pathways program that offers insurance only with proof of work or study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The problem is that Georgiaâ€™s health care policy failures are deliberate choices made by Gov. Kemp and the Republican leadership in the legislature,&quot; outgoing House Minority Leader Gloria Butler, a Stone Mountain Democrat, told reporters. &quot;We were told to let them cook. We were told that if we were nice to Republicans and if we asked politely, Medicaid expansion would be on the table. But guess what? It is still on the table.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Five people were wounded outside a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/michigan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;bar in Detroit&lt;/a&gt; after a disagreement over a parking spot, police said.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Detroit Police Department Assistant Police Chief Charles Fitzgerald said during a press conference that the fight broke out at about 2:45 a.m. on Friday at Chicago Blu&apos;z Bar &amp;amp; Grill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Senseless, ridiculous,&quot; Fitzgerald said. &quot;Five people to be shot over a parking spot is just silly to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Police said that&lt;/a&gt; the fight over the parking spot quickly turned violent after one man pulled out a firearm and began firing into a crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/3-pennsylvania-men-convictions-overturned-decades-behind-bars-womans-1997-killing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 PENNSYLVANIA MEN HAVE CONVICTION OVERTURNED AFTER DECADES BEHIND BARS IN WOMAN&apos;S 1997 KILLING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victims, who ranged in age from 33-49, suffered non-life-threatening injuries, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/nj-man-arrested-9-year-old-son-found-dead-burning-car&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NJ MAN ARRESTED AFTER 9-YEAR-OLD SON FOUND DEAD INSIDE BURNING CAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one of the five victims was involved in the dispute, while the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;others were bystanders&lt;/a&gt;, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The male suspect was still at large as of Friday evening.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He left the area in a dark-colored SUV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitzgerald said that they are investigating why the bar was open at 2:45 a.m., noting that it should have been closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Obviously, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/bars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;this blues club&lt;/a&gt; should not have been open at 2:45 a.m. where they&apos;re still arguing for a parking spot,&quot; Fitzgerald said.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with information is asked to contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-SPEAK-UP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Minor league baseball team&apos;s Ozempig mascot irks fans; officials brush off criticism</title>
                    
                    <description>The St. Paul Saints came under fire for naming their pig mascot Ozempig after the popular weight loss drug Ozempic, but some say they struck out.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;minor league baseball&lt;/a&gt; affiliate of the Minnesota Twins started the 2024 season off a little hotter than expected even before it had a chance to throw out a first pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The St. Paul Saints, who play in the International League, named their living, breathing pig mascot Ozempig after the popular weight loss &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/ozempic-happy-drug-study-suggests-weight-loss-medications-reduce-depression-anxiety&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;drug Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone thought it was a home run. The Saints received criticism almost immediately after announcing the name last weekend, and some see it as fat shaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sean Aronson, the Saints&apos; vice president and media relations director, told The Associated Press Friday the organization was only trying to name its mascot something amusing and topical when it chose Ozempig. Aronson said officials were stunned many found the name offensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In today&apos;s world, people don&apos;t want to be diminished, they don&apos;t want to be made to feel a certain way, and I&apos;m not going to tell them how they feel is wrong,&quot; he said. &quot;But I can tell you there was no ill intent. There was no maliciousness. There was never even a discussion in the room when we were going over the name that, â€˜Hey, this may offend some people.â€™&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans were mostly upset over its backstory â€” the pig&apos;s embarrassment at gaining weight and its effort at staying trim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Saints, part of the independent American Association from 2006 to 2020 before entering the minor league baseball system, are accustomed to wild promotions. Fun usually comes second nature to the teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nationals-nick-senzel-breaks-thumb-warmups-opening-day-its-awful&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NATIONALS&apos; NICK SENZEL BREAKS THUMB IN WARMUPS AHEAD OF OPENING DAY: &apos;IT&apos;S AWFUL&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the Saints played a game without umpires. Instead, a judge called pitches behind the plate, and a jury of Little Leaguers umpired first and third with the judge able to overrule them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organization clowned Anthony Weiner over his sexting scandal in 2011 with the first 1,501 fans 18 years or older receiving &quot;Tweeting Weiner Boxer Shorts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crash Davis, Kevin Costnerâ€™s character in the beloved &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;baseball movie&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Bull Durham,&quot; may have said it best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This gameâ€™s fun, OK? Itâ€™s fun godd-----.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saints fans came to the defense of the team, and Aronson said he understood where other peopleâ€™s positions were rooted. But the name of the pig isn&apos;t changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We knew how we originally came up with the name, and we&apos;re good with it. But we did discuss it and decided we&apos;re going to keep it,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/minnesota-twins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Saints&lt;/a&gt; were scheduled to begin the season Friday night but weather postponed it. The team will play the Columbus Clippers Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digitalâ€™s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>President Biden&amp;apos;s re-election campaign has released a video reaching out to Nikki Haley&amp;apos;s voters as he and former President Trump vie for their support in the general election.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;President Biden appealed to supporters of Nikki Haley in a new campaign ad on Friday.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you voted for Nikki Haley, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; doesnâ€™t want your vote,&quot; the ad begins, showing clips of the presumptive Republican nominee Trump calling the former South Carolina governor Haley &quot;bird brain&quot; and claiming she made an &quot;unholy alliance with RINOs, Never Trumpers, [and] Americans for No Prosperity.&quot;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another clip later in the ad shows Trump telling a reporter he didnâ€™t think &quot;we need too many&quot; after he was asked about how to &quot;bring Haley voters back into the tent.&quot;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nikki Haley voters, Donald Trump doesnâ€™t want your vote,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden&lt;/a&gt; wrote on X, linking to the ad. &quot;I want to be clear: There is a place for you in my campaign.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wealthy-nikki-haley-donors-launch-effort-boost-biden-over-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WEALTHY NIKKI HALEY VOTERS LAUNCH EFFORT TO BOOST BIDEN OVER TRUMP: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nikki-haley-drops-out-2024-race-ending-challenge-against-trump-gop-presidential-nomination&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Haley dropped out of the presidential&lt;/a&gt; race after Super Tuesday earlier this month, following losses in almost every state to Trump. She had remained in the race as Trumpâ€™s last opponent for the nomination despite his almost insurmountable lead, because she felt voters deserved another choice.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After leaving the race, Haley, who served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, didn&apos;t endorse him.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-aims-trounce-bidens-record-26-million-haul-upcoming-florida-fundraiser&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP&apos;S AIMS TO TROUNCE BIDEN&apos;S RECORD $26 MILLION HAUL AT UPCOMING FLORIDA FUNDRAISER: â€˜WE FEEL REALLY GOODâ€™&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In just Michigan, North Carolina and Nevada â€” three important battleground states â€” Haley earned nearly 570,000 votes.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Super Tuesday, Trump said on Truth Social he would &quot;like to invite all of the Haley supporters to join the greatest movement in the history of our Nation. BIDEN IS THE ENEMY, HE IS DESTROYING OUR COUNTRY.&quot;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before she dropped out, Trump had warned that anyone who donated to Haley&apos;s campaign would be &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-nikki-haley-donors-permanently-barred-maga-movement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;permanently barred from the MAGA camp&lt;/a&gt;.

                    <title>Jets bolster pass rush with acquisition of Haason Reddick in trade: reports</title>
                    
                    <description>The Jets essentially made a swap in edge-rushing talent by acquiring Haason Reddick from the Eagles, weeks after Bryce Huff left for Philadelphia, according to multiple reports.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-jets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York Jets&lt;/a&gt; had a void to fill on their defensive line following edge rusher Bryce Huff&apos;s departure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the team appeared to address the hole in their pass rush by pulling off a trade with the team Huff signed a three-year contract with in mid-March â€” the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/philadelphia-eagles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt;. The Eagles reportedly traded Reddick to the Jets Friday.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jets sent a conditional 2026 third-round draft pick to the Eagles in exchange for Reddick. Philadelphia&apos;s compensation could become a second-round pick if Reddick reaches certain playing time thresholds and records at least 10 sacks, sources told ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 29-year-old Reddick finished the 2023 season with 11 sacks in 17 games. Huff had a team-leading 10 sacks for New York last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reddick&apos;s 50Â½ sacks over the last four seasons are the fourth most in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the NFL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/eagles-saquon-barkley-admits-dad-would-still-cheer-jets-over-philly-super-bowl-matchup&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EAGLES&apos; SAQUON BARKLEY ADMITS DAD WOULD STILL CHEER FOR JETS OVER PHILLY IN SUPER BOWL MATCHUP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reddick is entering the final year of his current deal, but his representatives are expected to negotiate a new long-term contract with the Jets before the 2024 season kicks off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This latest move by the Jets shows the team is trying to bolster its roster ahead of quarterback &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/aaron-rodgers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Aaron Rodgers&apos;&lt;/a&gt; second season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jets also added eight-time All-Pro offensive lineman Tyron Smith and veteran offensive tackle Morgan Moses to the roster this offseason as part of the team&apos;s win-now approach. Former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chargers-release-mike-williams-save-20m-get-under-nfl-salary-cap&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chargers receiver Mike Williams&lt;/a&gt; is hoping to catch passes from Rodgers once the season kicks off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The more, the merrier,&quot; Jets coach Robert Saleh noted earlier this week at the annual league meeting in Florida. Saleh also expressed excitement about Reddick&apos;s versatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He&apos;s definitely found a new lease on life in that front. He&apos;s dynamic. He&apos;s versatile. They can do a lot of different things with him, but he&apos;s a three-way rusher. He can win inside. He can win outside. He can run right through you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reddick failed to record a sack during the last five games of last season, but his drop-off was largely attributed to a late-season change in defensive philosophy. Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni stripped Sean Desai of his defensive play-calling duties in mid-December.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The play-calling was handed over to Matt Patricia, who introduced new schemes.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digitalâ€™s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Notre Dame star freshman Hannah Hidalgo took issue with the referees over the removal of her nose ring during a tournament game against Oregon State.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/notre-dame-fighting-irish&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Notre Dame womenâ€™s basketball&lt;/a&gt; star Hannah Hidalgo was the subject of some controversy during the teamâ€™s stunning loss to Oregon State in the NCAA Tournament Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue stemmed from the nose ring Hidalgo wore during the game. She was forced to miss a few minutes of the second quarter as the teamâ€™s training staff attempted to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NCAA womenâ€™s basketball&lt;/a&gt; Rule 1-25.7 states that no jewelry is permitted to be worn during games. However, Hidalgo had worn the nose ring through the entire season and in the first two games of the tournament.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also told ESPN one official told her she was able to wear the nose ring as long as she covered it up, but it became a bigger issue once the second quarter began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I thought it was BS, because I&apos;m on a run, I&apos;m on a roll,&quot; she said. &quot;I scored two baskets and then, having to sit out for all that time, I was starting to get cold. I think (the officials) were worried about the wrong things. They should have reffed the game.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/iowa-star-caitlin-clark-invited-us-national-team-olympic-training-camp-national-championship-pursuit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IOWA STAR CAITLIN CLARK INVITED TO US NATIONAL TEAM OLYMPIC TRAINING CAMP AMID NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP PURSUIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notre Dame coach Niele Ivey said she wished she was told about the nose ring issue before the game started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidalgo finished with 10 points in one of the worst shooting performances she had all season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/oregon-state-beavers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Oregon State&lt;/a&gt; won the game, 70-65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All of us over the spring, over the summer and into this year, we came in with the mindset of understanding what we needed to accomplish defensively in order to win those close games,&quot; Beavers star Timea Gardiner said.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So, this year, that core group, we know what it takes now. Weâ€™re obviously doing it, so itâ€™s super fun.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardiner scored 21 points and grabbed 11 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oregon State will play in the Elite Eight for only the third time in its history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digitalâ€™s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Tony Evers vetoed 41 bills passed by the Republican-led Legislature on Friday â€” rejecting a $3 billion Republican tax cut, political loyalty pledges for higher education employees, and a plan setting how many wolves can be hunted each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evers signed a bipartisan bill to provide $400,000 supporting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/holocaust&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Holocaust education&lt;/a&gt; in Wisconsin schools. A 2021 law requires teaching about the Holocaust in grades 5 through 12 statewide. The money approved by Evers will go to the Nathan and Esther Pelz Holocaust Education Resource Center to support that education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also signed a bipartisan bill designed to increase the number of mental health crisis centers across the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/evers-signs-laws-designed-bolster-safety-judges-combat-human-trafficking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVERS SIGNS NEW LAWS DESIGNED TO BOLSTER SAFETY OF JUDGES, COMBAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During more than five years as governor with a Republican-controlled Legislature, Evers has vetoed more bills than any governor in Wisconsin history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evers vetoed a bill that would have prohibited the Universities of Wisconsin and other higher education institutions from conditioning employment and admission decisions on diversity statements. Right now, UW doesn&apos;t have any such spoken loyalty pledges in higher education, making the bill unnecessary, Evers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans passed the measure as part of their effort both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/wisconsin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; and across the country to restrict diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives on university campuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evers also vetoed a bill that would have allowed school boards to hire superintendents who donâ€™t have a license from the state education department. Evers, who previously worked as a principal and school district superintendent, said he objected to not having standards for the position in charge of school operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republican backers pitched it as a way to help deal with turnover in superintendent positions across the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill, opposed by groups representing school officials including superintendents, would have created the same exemption from the superintendent license requirement in place only at Milwaukee Public Schools, the stateâ€™s largest district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another bill signed by Evers would allow people to be charged fees to redact recorded audio and video content provided under open records requests. Media organizations and open records advocates opposed the bill. It passed with bipartisan support and was backed by law enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evers had vowed to veto the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance/taxes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GOP tax cut bill&lt;/a&gt;, one of several tax cut measures passed by Republicans this session that the governor rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scuttled tax plan would have dropped the state income tax from 5.3% to 4.4% for individual income between $27,630 and $304,170, and for married couples between $18,420 and $405,550.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill would also have excluded the first $150,000 of a coupleâ€™s retirement income from taxes, which would apply to people over 67.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measure would have reduced tax collections by $3.2 billion over two years, which the governor called &quot;fiscally irresponsible&quot; in his veto message. He said the state would&apos;ve been unable to meet its basic obligations like funding schools and prisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evers noted how earlier this month he did sign a more limited, bipartisan tax cut that will expand the state&apos;s child care tax credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wolf bill Evers vetoed would have required state wildlife managers to set a firm numeric goal for the stateâ€™s wolf population. Republicans passed the measure after the state Department of Natural Resources did not set a hard cap on the stateâ€™s wolf population in its new management plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State wildlife officials told lawmakers that a lack of a hard limit gives the DNR more flexibility to manage the species, allows local wolf packs to fluctuate and gives the population a better chance at maintaining wolf abundance for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunting advocates support setting a population limit, saying the lack of a goal leaves both wolves and people unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evers, in his veto message, said setting a numeric goal does not consider the social, scientific, biological and legal complexities of a recovered wolf population. He also said he objected to the Legislature micromanaging the DNR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Chicago plans to move migrants to other shelters and reopen park buildings for the summer</title>
                    
                    <description>Five Chicago shelters for migrants will soon close and nearly 800 people will be moved in order for the city to reopen park district buildings in time for summer.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (AP) â€” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/chicago-mayor-defends-council-member-appeared-pro-palestinian-rally-american-flag-burned&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; plans to close five shelters for migrants in the coming weeks and move nearly 800 people, including families, in order to reopen park district buildings hosting popular summer camps, athletic contests and other community events in time for summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift is part of the cityâ€™s ongoing scramble to meet the needs of people arriving from the U.S. border with Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chicago-migrant-evictions-add-homelessness-lawmaker-democrat-led-cities-scale-back-aid&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHICAGO MIGRANT EVICTIONS WILL ADD TO HOMELESSNESS, LAWMAKER SAYS, AS DEMOCRAT-LED CITIES SCALE BACK AID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates for the newly arrived have frequently criticized Mayor Brandon Johnson, a Democrat, and argued that the available services are inadequate. Others believe Chicago is unfairly prioritizing new arrivals over longtime residents, including unhoused people with similar needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHY CLOSE THE SHELTERS NOW?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson announced the plan to close the park district shelters this week, saying they were &quot;no longer necessary.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am proud of the efforts of my administration, our partners, and the many Chicagoans who stepped up to welcome new arrivals by providing shelter in our Park District field houses at a time when this was clearly needed,&quot; Johnson said in a statement Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are grateful to the alderpersons and communities who have embraced new neighbors with open arms, and we are pleased that these park facilities will be transitioned back to their intended purpose in time for summer programming.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago has reported more than 37,000 migrants arriving to the city since 2022, when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott began sending buses of people to so-called sanctuary cities. Many migrants who land in Chicago come from Venezuela, where a social, political and economic crisis has pushed millions into poverty, and where three-quarters of residents live on less than $1.90 a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city initially used police stations and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chicago-quietly-moves-migrants-airports-senate-committee-probe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;airports&lt;/a&gt; as officials searched for other temporary shelters. Some residents of neighborhoods surrounding some of the park district fieldhouses have regularly protested their use as shelters since last summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, a city dashboard showed more than 10,000 people remain in city-run shelters. That&apos;s down from a peak of nearly 15,000 in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city has not specified when all the park buildings will be empty, only that it will take several weeks. Volunteers who work with migrants said residents of at least two of the park buildings were told they will begin moving to other shelters Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT ABOUT OTHER SHELTERS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 20 other temporary shelters are still operating in the city, including churches, hotels, a library and former warehouses. The largest shelters are housing more than 1,000 people while others reported counts closer to 100, according to the city&apos;s latest update this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city is aiming to move people to other shelters closer to the park buildings, particularly families with children enrolled in nearby schools, Johnsonâ€™s statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago began enforcing a 60-day limit on shelter stays in mid-March. But many exemptions, including for families with children in school, have meant few people are actually being evicted yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city has reported only 24 people leaving shelters so far because of the caps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other U.S. cities, including New York and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/denver-pleads-property-owners-rent-migrant-newcomers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;, have used similar shelter limits to cope with limited resource availability for migrants arriving by bus and plane. Mayors also have pleaded for more federal help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chicago, people who are evicted can return to the city&apos;s &quot;landing zone&quot; and reapply for shelter. Volunteers have said that sometimes means people leave a shelter and are sent back to the same location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR MIGRANTS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volunteers who work with new arrivals said they understand the desire for neighborhoods to have park district facilities back, particularly for camps and other programs popular during summer months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they worry the forced move will upend migrants&apos; efforts to find work and get their children to school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Most people are actively, constantly trying to figure out how they get out of shelters,&quot; volunteer Lydia Wong said. &quot;I don&apos;t know that this helps expedite it at all. The city is saying they want to keep people relatively close, but it&apos;s extremely disruptive â€” needing to find new routes, new ways to get to school or work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several people living in the park-based shelters told The Associated Press this week they had received little information about the cityâ€™s plan, including where they might be moved. They declined to give their names, with several saying they did not want to face any retaliation from employees of the private agency running the shelters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday, the city said more than 15,000 people have found other housing since officials began keeping data in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many have sought rental assistance provided by the state. More than 5,600 families have used the program to find housing, according to the Illinois Department of Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a few exceptions like diplomats and people on tourist visas, immigrants in the U.S. must notify officials when they move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asylum seekers in the immigration court system have five days to do so after changing addresses, to ensure they receive notifications from the court. Missing mail might not sink their case directly, but failing to show up for a court date could lead to them being deported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Al Sharpton, joining in on the religious rite with a group of men incarcerated at the troubled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/rikers-island-staffer-slashed-inmate-troubles-nyc-jail-complex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rikers Island jail complex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ceremony came as part of a visit to the jail complex where Adams was scheduled to meet with detainees on the Christian holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/mayor-adams-breakfast-club-interview-turns-heated-slain-nypd-officer-far-left-disagrees-me&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAYOR ADAMS â€˜BREAKFAST CLUBâ€™ INTERVIEW TURNS HEATED OVER SLAIN NYPD OFFICER: &apos;THE FAR LEFT&apos; DISAGREES WITH ME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Having been arrested and then elected mayor, I reminded these young men that where you are is not who you are,&quot; Adams, a Democrat, said in a statement. &quot;For the first time in their lives, their mayor didnâ€™t look down at them â€” I sat side by side with them to be cleansed and recommit ourselves to getting on the right path.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images from the event, provided by the mayor&apos;s office, appear to show Adams interlocking hands with Sharpton during a prayer, the reverend washing Adams&apos; feet and Adams being baptized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams and the civil rights leader have close ties through their long tenures in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/people-heard-clapping-ny-gov-hochul-abruptly-leaves-slain-nypd-officers-wake-after-just-ten-minutes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; politics. Adams often calls into Sharpton&apos;s satellite radio show and the pair have appeared together at City Hall events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plagued by violence and neglect, the city-run jail complex, has been the subject of an ongoing legal battle that could result in a federal takeover of the facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor had also visited Rikers earlier this week to meet with detainees. In an interview this week on New York City radio show &quot;The Breakfast Club,&quot; Adams said he met with &quot;a group of 12 young brothers who recommitted themselves to Christ.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Iâ€™ve been on Rikers Island more than any mayor in the history of the city talking with inmates and correction officers to turn around whatâ€™s happening on Rikers Island,&quot; Adams said in the heated radio interview, which aired Friday.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/maine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Special Olympics Maine&lt;/a&gt; groomed a 9-year-old boy for sexual abuse that spanned two decades in which he encouraged the victim to accompany him on business trips and provided him with employment â€” and threatened him to keep it quiet, according to a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiff, who was not a Special Olympics athlete, says the organization knew about Melvin &quot;Mickey&quot; Boutilier&apos;s history of abuse after he helped create Special Olympics Maine and should have stopped him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special Olympics International and Special Olympics Maine said officials were &quot;shocked and saddened&quot; by the claims and that a violation of trust by anyone involved in the organization &quot;tears at the fabric of the movement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/parents-warned-social-media-breeding-ground-sex-abuse-among-minors-expert&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PARENTS WARNED SOCIAL MEDIA IS BREEDING GROUND FOR SEX ABUSE AMONG MINORS: EXPERT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are taking these claims very seriously and are currently investigating the allegations. The passage of time does not lessen the severity of the allegations,&quot; the organizations said in a joint statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boutilier died in 2012 at age 83, and his sister died in 2022. A granddaughter of Boutilier who worked for Special Olympics didnâ€™t immediately return a message seeking comment on his behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Frank, 65, of Augusta, Maine, was allowed to bring the lawsuit after the Maine Legislature loosened the statute of limitations on civil lawsuits for childhood sexual abuse. The law allowed dozens of new lawsuits to be filed against the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland, summer camps and other organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit filed last month, Frank says he met Boutilier in 1967 â€” at age 9 â€” when Boutilier coached a basketball team called &quot;Boot&apos;s Bombers&quot; in Gorham, Maine. That was two years before the special education teacher held the first Special Olympics Maine event and seven years before he was honored as &quot;Maine Teacher of the Year.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank says in the lawsuit that Boutilier held pizza parties for team members before gradually singling out Frank, then introducing the boy to pornography and alcohol and sexually abusing him at age 11. Frank says in the lawsuit that the abuse continued after Special Olympics Maine was formally incorporated in 1973, with Frank routinely accompanying Boutilier on business trips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/associated-press&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; does not typically name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified, as Frank did. Frank was not available for comment on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney Michael Bigos said Frank was abused &quot;dozens if not hundreds&quot; of times by Boutilier. Frank says in the lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, that he suffered debilitating emotional injury and permanent psychological damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;During that era, organizations with access to and control of children, especially those with vulnerabilities, were well aware of the risk of perpetrators of sexual abuse. We believe that The Special Olympics failed to warn, failed to adequately train, and failed to prevent against the known risks of child sexual abuse,&quot; Bigos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bigos encouraged others who may have been abused to come forward. But he said Friday that he was unaware of any other victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boutilier was an Army veteran who served in Korea before returning to Maine to teach in Bridgton and Gorham, in Maine, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-hampshire&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Groveton, New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, according to his obituary. He spent summers working at Camp Waban, a day camp for children with intellectual disabilities, putting him on a career path as a special education teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While teaching in Gorham, Boutilier took a group of special education students to compete in the inaugural Special Olympics founded by Eunice Kennedy Shriver. The experience at Soldiers Field in Chicago inspired Boutilier to start the first Special Olympics Maine. After that, he held the nation&apos;s first winter Special Olympics in Maine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Washington Post columnist Taylor Lorenz goes viral following masked appearance at Pornhub Awards</title>
                    
                    <description>Washington Post columnist Taylor Lorenz raised some eyebrows with her social media posts of her attending the Pornhub Awards this week in West Hollywood.</description>

Huge support to all the performers there,&quot; Lorenz wrote while sharing in an image of herself entering the awards wearing a black medical mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenz also shared a video of herself dancing in front of a DJ at the event, this time wearing a white mask.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/kellyanne-conway-torches-taylor-lorenz-peter-pan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KELLYANNE CONWAY TORCHES TAYLOR LORENZ ON â€˜THE VIEWâ€™: Â THIS â€˜PETER PANâ€™ WAS OBSESSED WITH MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenz&apos;s trip to the Pornhub Awards had her critics howling.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-taylor-lorenz-libs-of-tiktok&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WASHINGTON POST&apos;S TAYLOR LORENZ DOXXES LIBS OF TIKTOK DAYS AFTER DECRYING ONLINE HARASSMENT OF WOMEN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Here is Taylor Lorenz dancing at the P*rnhub awards event while wearing a mask. I saw it so now you have to,&quot; Libs of TikTok reacted.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If sheâ€™s partying with P*rnhub awardees, that mask isnâ€™t going to help her,&quot; RedState columnist Buzz Patterson quipped.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is on brand,&quot; Townhall.com senior columnist Kurt Schlichter said.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some compared her dancing to &quot;Seinfeld&quot; character Elaine Benes while others condemned the popular porn site, citing how its parent company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/pornhub-owner-resolves-us-probe-sex-trafficking-ties-paying&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;was fined $1.8 million&lt;/a&gt; in resolving a federal probe into its ties with an alleged sex trafficking operation.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenz mocked her critics, calling them &quot;the most triggered people alive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-taylor-lorenz-defends-libs-of-tiktok-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WAPO&apos;S TAYLOR LORENZ SAYS IT&apos;S â€˜PATENTLY FALSEâ€™ THAT HER LIBS OF TIKTOK STORY LINKED TO PERSONAL INFO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenz has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;generated headlines&lt;/a&gt; in recent years for how she goes about her reporting. She is perhaps best known for doxxing the popular social media account Libs of TikTok in 2022. Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics have also repeatedly mocked The Post reporter for her ongoing mask-wearing as a COVID precaution.Â &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Maine Gov. Mills proposes budget revisions for housing, childcare</title>
                    
                    <description>Democratic Maine Gov. Janet Mills unveiled Friday a budget revision that includes additional, one-time spending on housing expenditures, as well as more childcare grants.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Democratic Gov. Janet Mills on Friday unveiled a budget revision that includes additional one-time spending to build &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/maine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;more housing&lt;/a&gt; for Maine residents, to provide grants to child care providers, and to accelerate nursing facility rate reform, among other initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included in the proposed spending is $5 million to help mobile home residents buy their mobile home parks and another $22 million to build additional housing, both of which are aimed at helping with the state&apos;s housing crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/maine-rejects-sweeping-electric-vehicle-mandate-blow-governors-climate-agenda&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAINE REJECTS SWEEPING ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATE IN BLOW TO GOVERNOR&apos;S CLIMATE AGENDA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This fiscally responsible proposal aims to address some of the most urgent challenges &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/maine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Maine people&lt;/a&gt; are facing, like access to affordable housing, child care, and long-term care,&quot; Mills said in a statement. &quot;And it aims to tackle these critically important items in a financially sustainable way, ensuring that, when taken with my previous proposal to save money, the State of Maine can meet its ongoing commitments in the next biennium.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new spending increases her biennial budget proposal to nearly $10.44 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal reflects a projection of an additional $108 million in additional revenue by the nonpartisan Revenue Forecasting Committee. The boost was attributed to strong &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance/taxes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;corporate income tax revenues&lt;/a&gt;, which are considered volatile for long-term budgeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor&apos;s proposal sets the stage for lawmakers to finish negotiations and bring the budget to the floor for votes. They&apos;re racing the clock because lawmakers are due to adjourn on April 17.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Manhattan DA asks for gag order clarification after Trump names judge&apos;s daughter on social media</title>
                    
                    <description>Prosecutors in former President Trump&amp;apos;s hush-money trial are asking a judge to clarify a gag order following his social media posts this week.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Manhattan prosecutors are asking a judge to clarify a gag order imposed on former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;, following social media posts by the former commander-in-chief that criticized the judge&apos;s daughter.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter dated Friday to New York Judge Juan Merchan, prosecutors asked the judge to clarify if the order protects family members of the court, district attorney&apos;s office and other individuals. They asked the court to direct Trump to end attacks on family members after he went on a fiery rant on Truth Social and called out Merchan&apos;s daughter by name.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggested that Merchan was kowtowing to his daughterâ€™s interests as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/democrats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Democratic political&lt;/a&gt; consultant. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, claimed the judge&apos;s daughter, Loren Merchan, whose firm has worked on campaigns for President Joe Biden and other Democrats, had recently posted a photo on social media depicting her &quot;obvious goal&quot; of seeing him jailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-slams-bragg-plead-not-guilty-never-thought-anything-like-this-happen-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP SLAMS BRAGG AFTER PLEADING NOT GUILTY: &apos;I NEVER THOUGHT ANYTHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN IN AMERICA&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Judge Juan Merchan is totally compromised, and should be removed from this TRUMP Non-Case immediately,&quot; he wrote Thursday. &quot;His Daughter, Loren, is a Rabid Trump Hater, who has admitted to having conversations with her father about me, and yet he gagged me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Manhattan prosecutors said that witnesses and prospective jurors could likely fear similar attacks. They asked Merchan &quot;to make it abundantly clear&quot; who is protected by the gag order, to warn Trump about his conduct and sanction him if he violates the gag order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/manhattan-da-bragg-requests-judge-impose-gag-order-trump-hush-money-case&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MANHATTAN DA BRAGG REQUESTS JUDGE IMPOSE GAG ORDER ON TRUMP DURING HUSH MONEY CASE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s legal team responded with a letter saying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Manhattan District Attorney&apos;s Office&lt;/a&gt; is misinterpreting the order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Court cannot â€˜directâ€™ President Trump to do something that the gag order does not require,&quot; the letter said. &quot;To &apos;clarify or confirm&apos; the meaning of the gag order in the way the People suggest would be to expand it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-judge-imposes-gag-order-trump-bragg-hush-money-case&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;gag order&lt;/a&gt; bars Trump from either making or directing other people to make public statements on his behalf about jurors and potential witnesses in the hush-money trial, such as his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, and porn star Stormy Daniels. It also prohibits any statements meant to interfere with or harass the courtâ€™s staff, prosecution team or their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Merchan is presiding over Trump&apos;s upcoming trial in which he is accused of making hush-money payments during his 2016 presidential campaign. He pleaded not guilty last April to 34 counts of falsifying business records,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.Â &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
