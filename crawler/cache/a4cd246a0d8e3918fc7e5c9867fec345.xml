                    <title>Russian-American journalist to remain in custody for 2 more months following court order</title>
                    
                    <description>Alsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist, has been ordered to remain in custody for another two months pending her investigation and trial after being arrested on Oct. 18.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A court in Russia on Monday ordered a detained Russian-American journalist to be held in jail for two more months pending investigation and trial, in a further step in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Kremlin’s crackdown&lt;/a&gt; on dissent and free speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alsu Kurmasheva, an editor for the U.S. government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Tatar-Bashkir service, was taken into custody on Oct. 18 and charged with failing to register as a foreign agent while collecting information about the Russian military. Later, she was also charged with spreading &quot;false information&quot; about the Russian military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;court in Tatarstan&lt;/a&gt; on Monday ordered her to remain behind bars at least until June 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/second-american-journalist-detained-russia-this-year-evan-gershkovich&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SECOND AMERICAN JOURNALIST DETAINED IN RUSSIA THIS YEAR AFTER EVAN GERSHKOVICH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurmasheva, who holds U.S. and Russian citizenship and lives in Prague with her husband and two daughters, could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted, according to RFE/RL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told reporters in the courtroom on Monday that she wasn&apos;t doing &quot;very well physically&quot; and that some of her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;medical conditions&lt;/a&gt; have flared up in detention. &quot;Living conditions are very bad, I have no way of taking care of my health,&quot; she said, adding that medical assistance in the detention center was &quot;minimal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian authorities have intensified a crackdown on Kremlin critics and independent journalists after President Vladimir Putin sent troops to Ukraine in February 2022, using legislation that effectively criminalized any public expression about the conflict that deviates from the Kremlin line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurmasheva was the second U.S. journalist detained in Russia last year, after Wall Street Journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-says-he-working-secure-release-evan-gershkovich-1-year-anniversary-detention-russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;reporter Evan Gershkovich&lt;/a&gt; was arrested on espionage charges in March. Gershkovich and his employer have rejected the charges, and the U.S. authorities designated him wrongfully detained. He has spent a year in custody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurmasheva was initially stopped on June 2 at Kazan International Airport after traveling to Russia the previous month to visit her ailing elderly mother. Officials confiscated her U.S. and Russian passports and fined her for failing to register her U.S. passport. She was waiting for her passports to be returned when she was arrested on new charges in October. RFE/RL has called for her release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFE/RL was told by Russian authorities in 2017 to register as a foreign agent, but it has challenged Moscow’s use of foreign agent laws in the European Court of Human Rights. The organization has been fined millions of dollars by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Monday that a person in Texas has tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, otherwise known as H5N1 bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This person had exposure to dairy cattle in Texas presumed to be infected with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses. The patient reported eye redness (consistent with conjunctivitis), as their only symptom, and is recovering,&quot; the CDC said in a statement. &quot;The patient was told to isolate and is being treated with an antiviral drug for flu.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC said this is the second case of a human testing positive for H5N1 in the United States, after a previous case was observed in Colorado in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a developing story.

                    <title>Biden administration tightens rules on African elephant imports, stops short of total ban</title>
                    
                    <description>The Biden administration is implementing new restrictions on the trade of elephant trophies, but declined to issue an outright ban, sparking rebuke from some advocates.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration strengthened&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/100-elephants-die-africas-largest-national-parks-drought&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; protections for African elephants&lt;/a&gt;, but stopped short of issuing a total ban on imports of hunting trophies and live animals, to the disappointment of wildlife activists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an announcement late last week, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-quietly-consulted-left-wing-eco-groups-plan-block-millions-acres-montana-ag&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service &lt;/a&gt;finalized restrictions on elephants imported to the U.S. under the Endangered Species Act, which it said would aid the long-term conservation and survival of elephants in the wild. Prominent wildlife activist organizations have called for the agency to go further and ban such imports altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Service values collaborative conservation of wildlife all around the world and is committed to improving implementation of international conservation law,&quot; FWS Director Martha Williams said. &quot;Our actions today will help support range countries’ efforts to manage and conserve African elephant populations and will further protect African elephants that are imported to the United States.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that FWS would continue to work with African nations to ensure the sustainable management of elephant populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/endangered-species-gray-wolves-threaten-farms-ranches-gop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS GRAY WOLVES TERRORIZE FARMS AND RANCHES, GOP LAWMAKERS DEMAND ENDANGERED SPECIES DELISTING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the finalized regulations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/many-zoos-us-phasing-out-elephants-others-embark-breeding-projects&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;live African elephants&lt;/a&gt;, African elephant sport hunting trophies (such as tusks, hides, feet and tails), and African elephant parts and products may be imported into the U.S., but only from countries that have laws in place to ensure conservation of the species. The regulations also require imports to go to American facilities that are able to properly care for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rulemaking further highlights the administration&apos;s view that, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-takes-aim-hunters-latest-regulation-preventing-americans-from-hunting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;hunting to achieve its conservation&lt;/a&gt; potential, it must be &quot;well-regulated&quot; and include accountability measures, FWS said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, advocates expressed disappointment at FWS&apos; decision to stop short of a full ban on imports and vowed to keep pushing for such a policy at the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-accelerates-plan-to-unleash-apex-predator-near-rural-community-over-widespread-local-opposition&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN ADMIN ACCELERATES PLAN TO UNLEASH GRIZZLY BEARS NEAR RURAL COMMUNITY OVER WIDESPREAD LOCAL OPPOSITION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m truly crushed this rule doesn’t ban trade in elephant hunting trophies to the United States, and it doesn’t even require stable elephant populations to allow trophy imports,&quot; said Tanya Sanerib, international legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity. &quot;These magnificent animals are globally cherished but under threat, and it&apos;s high time we stop letting wealthy trophy hunters turn them into decor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanerib said the restrictions finalized by the administration are &quot;mouse-sized&quot; and treat elephants like commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Flocken, the president of Humane Society International, applauded the new restrictions, but similarly called for even stronger measures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will continue to fight for a full ban on the trade in African elephant hunting trophies, and we hope this sets a precedent that can be applied to other countries and to other imperiled species, like lions, giraffes and leopards,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulations, which will take effect on May 1, 2024, were first proposed in November 2022. After they were proposed, FWS received thousands of comments from stakeholders, a large majority of whom called for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/endangered-species&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;increased conservation of African elephants&lt;/a&gt;, according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groups like the Performing Animal Welfare Society, Friends of Animals and the Animal Welfare Institute used their comments to call for the Biden administration to use the rulemaking to issue a complete ban on elephant imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Friends of Animals urges FWS to prohibit the import of live African elephants. There is no reason to continue to allow these intelligent and social creatures to suffer in captivity,&quot; Stephen Hernick, a senior attorney at the Wildlife Law Program for Friends of Animals, wrote in the group&apos;s comments last year.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Critics slam Scotland’s new hate speech law as an attack on freedom</title>
                    
                    <description>A new Scottish law making it a criminal offense to spread hate speech against protected groups online or elsewhere went into force just in time for April Fools&amp;apos; Day.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Scotland’s controversial new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/first-amendment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;hate speech law&lt;/a&gt; went into effect Monday despite fierce backlash from critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Scotland continues to infringe upon the right of her citizens to speak freely. This bill will force police to investigate those who ‘misgender’ someone online,&quot; Thomas Corbett-Dillon, a former adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, told Fox News Digital. &quot;In a country riddled by knife crime, and with one of the lowest life expectancies in Europe, you would think the Scottish Government has more important things to focus on, but no, they are desperate to pander to an extremely small group of men in dresses who feel offended when they are not referred to as women.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments come &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;as Scotland&lt;/a&gt; officially announced that its hate crime law aimed at providing &quot;greater protection for victims and communities&quot; came into force Monday, creating new criminal offenses for those who use &quot;threatening or abusive&quot; behavior intended to &quot;stir up hatred based on prejudice toward characteristics including age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity and variations in sex characteristics,&quot; according to a press release by the Scottish government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new law warns that people can be prosecuted for sharing offensive rhetoric across multiple media platforms, which includes &quot;displaying, publishing or distributing the material e.g. on a sign; on the internet through websites, blogs, podcasts, social media etc., either directly, or by forwarding or repeating material that originates from a third party; through printed media such as magazine publications or leaflets, etc. Giving, sending, showing or playing the material to another person e.g. through online streaming, by email, playing a video, through public performance of a play, etc.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/scotland-launch-new-hate-speech-law-april-fools-day-jail-people-7-years&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCOTLAND TO LAUNCH NEW HATE SPEECH LAW ON APRIL FOOL’S DAY THAT WILL JAIL PEOPLE FOR UP TO 7 YEARS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;People convicted&lt;/a&gt; of running afoul of the new laws could face fines and even a prison sentence of up to seven years, with proponents arguing the legislation will send &quot;a strong and clear message to victims, perpetrators, communities and to wider society that offences motivated by prejudice will be treated seriously and will not be tolerated.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the legislation has also been widely panned by critics, with renowned author J.K. Rowling describing the law as &quot;ludicrous&quot; in social media posts last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you genuinely imagine I’d delete posts calling a man a man, so as not to be prosecuted under this ludicrous law, stand by for the mother of all April Fools’ jokes,&quot; Rowling, a frequent critic of transgender ideology, said on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corbett-Dillon pointed to Rowling, noting that the Harry Potter author could be one of those targeted under the new legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bbc-disciplines-top-radio-host-calling-trans-women-male-during-radio-show&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BBC DISCIPLINES TOP RADIO HOST FOR CALLING TRANS WOMEN MALE DURING RADIO SHOW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This law could lead to renowned Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling being arrested because she refuses to call trans people ‘She’ online. This new law does nothing to protect women, or to stop men from entering into female sports competitions, or men entering into women’s bathrooms,&quot; Corbet-Dillon said. &quot;Trans people have become a ‘protected community’ in Scotland, but women remain unprotected.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Scottish government has defended the law, with Minister for Victims and Community Safety Siobhian Brown arguing that the country is &quot;building safer communities that live free from hatred and prejudice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We know that the impact on those on the receiving end of physical, verbal or online attacks can be traumatic and life-changing. This legislation is an essential element of our wider approach to tackling that harm,&quot; Brown said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown also argued that there were protections for free speech built into the legislation, noting the new offenses would have a &quot;higher threshold for criminality&quot; than old laws that have been in place since 1986.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But critics have still questioned those protections, with Faculty of Advocates’ Criminal Bar Association President Tony Lenehan worrying that the law could target journalists, comedians, debaters and dramatists, in comments to BBC last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those claims were pushed back on by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Scotland’s national police&lt;/a&gt;, who denied that the agency would proactively &quot;target actors, comedians, or any other people or groups.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Corbet-Dillon argued that the Scottish government should instead focus its attention on protecting free speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The trans community continue to destroy women’s rights in their desperate pursuit to receive affirmation of their gender delusions,&quot; Corbet-Dillon said. &quot;Scotland, and England, both urgently need to enshrine freedom of speech into their laws.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A Denver city official pleaded with migrants to leave the city and go to Chicago or New York, after the Colorado capital struggled to help those it previously welcomed.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Denver city official appeared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/denver-becoming-overwhelmed-40000-spike-migrant-population&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;beg migrants&lt;/a&gt; to leave the sanctuary city that&apos;s been burdened with illegal immigrants in a leaked viral video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/next/next-with-kyle-clark/denver-warns-newly-arrived-migrants-to-leave/73-9f475e63-47cd-4315-bd54-e2d4aa4e6adc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;obtained by 9NEWS&lt;/a&gt;, city official Andres Carrera, Denver&apos;s Newcomer Communications Liaison, tells a group of migrants that the city&apos;s shelters can no longer help them, and they must go to other sanctuary cities or they &quot;will suffer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The opportunities are over,&quot; Carrera reportedly tells the group in Spanish. &quot;New York gives you more. Chicago gives you more. So I suggest you go there where there is longer-term shelter. There are also more job opportunities there.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are not going to block you if you want to say here,&quot; he continues. &quot;If you stay here you are going to suffer even more and I don’t want to see this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/denver-pleads-property-owners-rent-migrant-newcomers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DENVER PLEADS WITH PROPERTY OWNERS TO RENT TO MIGRANT ‘NEWCOMERS’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the city official suggested New York, Chicago or Miami as destinations with more resources, he offered to transport them to any city they wished in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You don’t have to walk anywhere, we can buy you a free ticket,&quot; Carrera added. &quot;You can go to any city. We can take you up to the Canadian border, wherever!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A city spokesperson told 9News that they will not bus migrants to Canada but can take them to cities near the Canadian border if they desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his speech, Carrerra asked the migrants to raise their hand if they wanted to leave Denver and go to another city where there is more work. The video appeared to show a handful of people raising their hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/denver-mayor-pleads-nationally-coordinated-effort-migrant-crisis-city-nears-breaking-point&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DENVER MAYOR PLEADS FOR NATIONALLY COORDINATED EFFORT ON MIGRANT CRISIS AS CITY NEARS ‘BREAKING POINT’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who wants to stay in Denver?&quot; he then asked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Todos,&quot; or &quot;everyone,&quot; one migrant replies, as several people are shown raising their hands in the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sanctuary city has been struggling to stretch its limited resources to support the growing number of migrants in the city. Texas has transported thousands of migrants to sanctuary cities like Denver, to showcase the problems border states face when migrants flood their cities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the city argued the video did not show a complete picture of the efforts Denver has made to help migrants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This news clip showed such a small part of the work our team member did that evening, and just a fraction of the tireless amount of work he and the rest of the city’s team have put in to help newcomers who arrive in Denver,&quot; the spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our city has received more than 40,000 newcomers, or 5.6% of our population, which is the most per capita of any city in the country. We’re proud of the support we’ve been able to offer so far, but without federal support, Denver does not have the resources or capacity to maintain this outsized share of the load.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Given the number of people who have arrived in Denver, there are very few opportunities for work and housing, and those opportunities only continue to shrink. Encouraging onward travel to destinations where newcomers may have support networks or better opportunities will continue to be a critical part of our long-term strategy to ensure the greatest opportunity for success for both newcomers and the City of Denver,&quot; the statement continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston announced the city would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/denver-scales-back-migrant-services-closing-four-shelters-effort-reduce-budget-save-millions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;closing four migrant shelters&lt;/a&gt; to cut costs incurred by the border crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City leaders also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/denver-pleads-property-owners-rent-migrant-newcomers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;asked locals&lt;/a&gt; to rent their homes to illegal immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnston, like Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and New York City Mayor Eric Adams, has pleaded for more federal aid to help their cities deal with the overwhelming number of migrants &quot;crushing&quot; the city&apos;s budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Alba Cuebas-Fantauzzi contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Three pro-Palestinian protesters are facing charges after being arrested for disrupting an Easter weekend Mass at St. Patrick&amp;apos;s Cathedral in New York City.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A trio of pro-Palestinian protesters was released without bail in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; after being arrested for disrupting an Easter Vigil Mass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral by unfurling a banner and shouting, &quot;Free Palestine!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Police Department told Fox News Digital that Gregory Schwedock, 35, John Rozendaal, 63, of New York, and Matthew Menzies, 31, of Colchester, each have been charged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;disruption of a religious service&lt;/a&gt; following the incident caught on video Saturday night. Court records Monday indicate that all three men have since been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Three male individuals barged entered the church and disrupted Mass by approaching the altar while yelling ‘Free Palestine,’&quot; the NYPD said in a statement. &quot;The individuals were taken into custody at the scene without incident.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video taken at the scene shows a banner with the message &quot;Silence = Death&quot; being unfurled near the altar of the Easter Vigil service, which was led by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York. Security quickly removed the protesters from the area and many in attendance did not appear to acknowledge the outburst. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/pro-palestinian-protesters-interrupt-easter-vigil-service-st-patricks-cathedral-nyc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS INTERRUPT EASTER VIGIL SERVICE AT ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL IN NYC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The climate activist group behind the stunt, Extinction Rebellion, wrote on X that their activists &quot;demand all faith leaders take immediate and vocal action against genocide and ecocide.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;War, occupation, and industrial pollution are poisoning the soil, air and water in Gaza and all over the planet, destroying the earth’s capacity to sustain life,&quot; it continued. &quot;This destruction is called ‘Ecocide.’&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;With thirty thousand dead in Gaza and all life on earth threatened by the climate crisis, every individual and every institution that values justice, peace, and love has a duty to oppose genocide and ecocide in a way that can be clearly seen and heard by all,&quot; it also said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/pro-palestinian-protesters-disrupt-berkeley-city-council-meeting-holocaust-remembrance-vote-end-israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS DISRUPT BERKELEY CITY COUNCIL MEETING, HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE VOTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops had issued a call for prayer for peace in the Middle East and an end to the Israel-Hamas war in a statement before the start of Holy Week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Patrick’s Cathedral did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwedock, who was one of the protesters arrested, was previously taken into custody last September &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/end-fossil-fuels-protesters-disrupt-us-open-semifinal-match-demonstrator-glues-shoes-ground&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;after disrupting a U.S. Open tennis&lt;/a&gt; semifinal match during which climate activists used glue to prevent security from ejecting them, according to the New York Post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Stepheny Price contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Beach bands in Mexico are allowed to continue playing music after complaints threatened to end the noise</title>
                    
                    <description>Wandering beach bands playing near tourist hot spots in Mexico emerge victorious following dismissed noise complaints from foreign tourists in Mazaltan.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bands who play the thumping tuba-and-drums songs of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/location-mexico&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;northern Mexico&lt;/a&gt; on beaches in the resort city of Mazatlan appear to have emerged victorious this week after noise complaints had threatened to silence them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But anybody who planned to witness the April 8 eclipse in a moment of awed silence will likely be disappointed. Mazatlan, on the Pacific coast, will be first place in North America where the path of totality will be visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of complaints &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;from foreign tourists&lt;/a&gt; who like to observe the resort&apos;s sunsets in peace — or with a bit of soft music — a local hotel owner had suggested limiting the time or places where the bands could play. The bands usually wander the beaches, asking for a few dollars per song to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-warning-mexico-spring-break-travel-top-threats-facing-americans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US WARNING ON MEXICO SPRING BREAK TRAVEL, TOP THREATS FACING AMERICANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their music is hardly conducive to reflection or relaxation — think of a frantic, speed-fueled polka with lots and lots of brass and snare drums, earning the bands the nickname of tamboras, or drums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after a protest march by the musicians turned into a violent scuffle with police last week, efforts to limit them appear to have been abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The people are very conscious now, and they are defending their rights,&quot; President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Monday. &quot;This is how they make a living, and besides, this is a long-standing tradition ... and for that reason they protested and managed to get it reversed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What isn&apos;t good is the violence,&quot; López Obrador said. &quot;But the Sinaloa bands, or the musicians of the Sinaloa bands, are completely within their rights to protest, just no violence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there never appears to have been any city-wide ban, at least one hotel had put up signs prohibiting the bands from offering their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/beach&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;services to beachgoers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos of the scuffles between musicians and police went viral last week, with some band members hitting police with drum sticks. Drums were turned into weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubén Rocha, the governor of the northern state of Sinaloa, where Mazatlan is located, wrote in his social media accounts Thursday that &quot;I do not share the idea of prohibiting the musicians of Mazatlan from carrying out their honest dignified work, that allows them to feed their families.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue came to a head when local hotel operator Ernesto Coppel posted a video urging that the bands be limited as to when or where they could offer to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They are a disaster on the beaches of Mazatlan. They don&apos;t allow people to rest,&quot; Coppel said. &quot;I have a lot of complaints from hundreds of American tourists who say to me ‘I won’t return to Mazatlan because of the noise.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideas apparently included designating certain spaces on the beach for musicians, rather than having them wandering up and down the sand, playing to people in beach chairs in front of hotels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinaloa, which is home to the drug cartel of the same name, is not exactly known for restraint. An unusually high number of exotic animals like lions and tigers have been seized there, ornate mansion are the norm, and the main tourist attraction in the state capital is a graveyard featuring the lavish tombs of drug traffickers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Sutton was wanted for domestic battery by strangulation, which is a third-degree felony and could result in a prison term of up to five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;After weeks of evading law enforcement, this man has finally made the right choice to turn himself in,&quot; Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said. &quot;Domestic violence has no place in our community, and no one is above the law here in Hillsborough County. My thoughts are with this woman as she continues to heal from this man’s gruesome actions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lions released Sutton after police announced he was being sought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities said officers responded to a call about domestic violence in progress involving the former Pittsburgh Steelers player and a female around 5 a.m. on March 7. The sheriff’s office then asked the public for help trying to find Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lions president Rod Wood said at the time that Sutton was at the team’s training facility when the warrant was issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/police-seek-chiefs-rashee-rice-connection-major-crash-dallas-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POLICE SEEK CHIEFS&apos; RASHEE RICE IN CONNECTION WITH &apos;MAJOR&apos; CRASH IN DALLAS: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We learned about the warrant at the same time everybody else did on social media,&quot; Wood told Fox 2 Detroit last week. &quot;We were able to speak to Cam because he was actually in our building. We found him. He was down with our strength staff. He kind of showed up unexpectedly to work out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sutton signed a three-year, $30 million deal with the Lions before the start of the 2023 season after spending six years with the Steelers. He played and started all 17 games for Detroit and their three playoff games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had a career-high 65 tackles and an interception in 2023. He was projected to be a starting cornerback going into the 2024 season along with newly signed Carlton Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Pittsburgh selected&lt;/a&gt; the Jonesboro, Georgia, native in the third round of the 2017 draft out of Tennessee. He earned his way to being a starting cornerback in his fifth season with Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Steelers, he had 168 total tackles in 84 career games along with eight interceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Strange cicada facts to know before they emerge this spring: Zombie STD, strongest stream in animal kingdom</title>
                    
                    <description>Cicadas are about to emerge in numbers unseen for decades, but that is not the only strange thing about them. For instance, cicadas urinate stronger and faster than elephants.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The periodical &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/rare-broods-cicadas-arrive-soon-when-expect-them-what-means-you&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;cicadas that are about to infest&lt;/a&gt; two parts of the United States aren&apos;t just plentiful, they&apos;re downright weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insects are the strongest urinators in the animal kingdom with flows that put humans and elephants to shame. They have pumps in their heads that pull moisture from the roots of trees, allowing them to feed for more than a decade underground. They are rescuers of caterpillars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they are being ravaged by a sexually transmitted disease that turns them into zombies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/rare-simultaneous-explosion-cicadas-expected-first-time-221-years&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RARE &apos;SIMULTANEOUS EXPLOSION&apos; OF CICADAS EXPECTED FOR FIRST TIME IN 221 YEARS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside trees are sugary, nutrient-heavy saps that flow through tissue called phloem. Most insects love the sap. But not cicadas — they go for tissue called xylem, which carries mostly water and a bit of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it&apos;s not easy to get into the xylem, which doesn&apos;t just flow out when a bug taps into it because it&apos;s under negative pressure. The cicada can get the fluid because its outsized head has a pump, said University of Alabama Huntsville entomologist Carrie Deans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They use their proboscis like a tiny straw — about the width of a hair — with the pump sucking out the liquid, said Georgia Tech biophysics professor Saad Bhamla. They spend nearly their entire lives drinking, year after year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s a hard way to make a living,&quot; Deans said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that watery fluid has to come out the other end. And boy does it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhamla in March published a study of the urination flow rates of animals across the world. Cicadas were clearly king, peeing two to three times stronger and faster than elephants and humans. He couldn&apos;t look at the periodical cicadas that mostly feed and pee underground, but he used video to record and measure the flow rate of their Amazon cousins, which topped out around 10 feet per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have a muscle that pushes the waste through a tiny hole like a jet, Bhamla said. He said he learned this when in the Amazon he happened on a tree the locals called a &quot;weeping tree&quot; because liquid was flowing down, like the plant was crying. It was cicada pee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You walk around in a forest where they&apos;re actively chorusing on a hot sunny day. It feels like it&apos;s raining,&quot; said University of Connecticut entomologist John Cooley. That&apos;s their honeydew or waste product coming out the back end ... It&apos;s called cicada rain.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years and areas where cicadas come out, caterpillars enjoy a cicada reprieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Maryland entomologist Dan Gruner studied caterpillars after the 2021 cicada emergence in the mid-Atlantic. He found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/insects&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the bugs&lt;/a&gt; that turn into moths survived the spring in bigger numbers because the birds that usually eat them were too busy getting cicadas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Periodical cicadas are &quot;lazy, fat and slow,&quot; Gruner said. &quot;They&apos;re extraordinarily easy to capture for us and for their predators.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s a deadly sexually transmitted disease, a fungus, that turns cicadas into zombies and causes their private parts to fall off, Cooley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a real problem that &quot;is even stranger than science fiction,&quot; Cooley said. &quot;This is a sexually transmitted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/maryland-national-parks-see-first-cases-zombie-deer-disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;zombie disease&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooley has seen areas in the Midwest where up to 10% of the individuals were infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus is also the type that has hallucinatory effects on birds that would eat them, Cooley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This white fungus takes over the male, their gonads are torn from their body and chalky spores are spread around to nearby other cicadas, he said. The insects are sterilized, not killed. This way the fungus uses the cicadas to spread to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They&apos;re completely at the mercy of the fungus,&quot; Cooley said. &quot;They&apos;re walking dead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Russia has detained suspects in Caucasus linked to Moscow terror attack, security agency says</title>
                    
                    <description>Russia&amp;apos;s Federal Security Service says that it has broken up a terrorist cell whose members &amp;quot;directly participated in financing the perpetrators&amp;quot; of the Moscow terror attack.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Russia&apos;s top security agency said Monday it has broken up what it called a &quot;terrorist cell&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in southern Russia&lt;/a&gt; whose members had provided weapons and cash to suspected attackers of the Moscow concert hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Security Service, or FSB, said that on Sunday it detained four suspected members of the cell in the Russian province of Dagestan in the North Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency alleged that the suspects detained in Dagestan were involved in channeling funds and providing weapons to the gunmen who attacked the concert hall on Moscow&apos;s western edge on March 22, killing 144 people in the deadliest attack on Russian soil in two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/russian-special-unit-linked-havana-syndrome-sickened-us-officials-overseas-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUSSIAN SPECIAL UNIT LINKED TO HAVANA SYNDROME THAT SICKENED US OFFICIALS OVERSEAS: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The detained militants directly participated in financing the perpetrators of the March 22 terror &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;attack on the Crocus City Hall&lt;/a&gt; in Moscow and providing them with terror means,&quot; the FSB said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said one of the suspects detained in Dagestan had confessed to personally bringing weapons to the Moscow attackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FSB released a video showing one of the suspects saying that they also planned an attack in the city of Kaspiysk in Dagestan. It wasn’t clear whether the two confessions came from the same person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency said the suspects are foreign nationals, without specifying their nationality. The suspected attackers of the Moscow concert hall arrested hours after the March 22 raid are citizens of the Central Asian nation of Tajikistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The detention of four suspects in Dagestan follows the arrest of the four suspected gunmen and seven others who were accused of involvement in the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged that &quot;radical Islamists&quot; conducted the raid, but alleged - without providing evidence - that Ukraine and the West were involved, despite Kyiv&apos;s vehement denials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>&amp;quot;Saturday Night Live&amp;quot; cracked a joke comparing the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore and the lack of support for President Biden among Black voters.</description>

His support among Hispanic voters is down to 34% from 59%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;SNL&quot; has become more comfortable in recent months aiming jokes at Biden and his administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early March, &quot;SNL&quot; mocked Biden and his allies, who argue the president is mentally sharp and energetic &quot;behind closed doors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden has even become the butt of jokes in sketch-comedy shows overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/snl-mocked-woke-smugness-claiming-trump-made-up-term-de-banking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;‘SNL’ MOCKED FOR THEIR ‘WOKE SMUGNESS’ AFTER CLAIMING TRUMP MADE UP THE TERM ‘DE-BANKING’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/italian-snl-belittles-biden-season-premiere-parody&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;An Italian comedic sketch show&lt;/a&gt; mocked President Biden&apos;s mental fitness in its eighth season premiere episode on February 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italian comedian Maurizio Crozza played the U.S. president in at least two skits for his one-man sketch show called &quot;Fratelli di Crozza,&quot; where he impersonates various public figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one sketch that went viral on social media, Crozza, as Biden, appears dazed and confused while holding a press conference at the White House. An Italian voice off-screen attempts to guide and correct Crozza as he rambles nonsensically and forgets world leaders&apos; names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Kristine Parks contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Rebel Wilson doubles down on sexual harassment claims against Sacha Baron Cohen: &apos;Humiliated and degraded&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Rebel Wilson is standing by her allegations against Sacha Baron Cohen, saying her claims about his &amp;quot;a--hole&amp;quot; behavior on a movie set were &amp;quot;fully legally vetted.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rebel-wilson-tried-ozempic-weight-loss-journey-those-drugs-can-be-good&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rebel Wilson&lt;/a&gt; isn&apos;t backing down from her shocking claims about former co-star Sacha Baron Cohen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actress wrote about her experience of working with Cohen in her new memoir, &quot;Rebel Rising,&quot; describing how uncomfortable she felt while filming their 2016 film, &quot;The Brothers Grimsby.&quot; Cohen has vehemently denied her claims, and now, Wilson is insisting she&apos;s telling the truth, saying she was &quot;humiliated and degraded as a person&quot; on the movie set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That was something that happened 10 years ago, and obviously I&apos;ve moved past it now, but it was my worst professional experience,&quot; she admitted in an interview on &quot;Today&quot; on Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sacha-baron-cohen-denies-rebel-wilsons-claim-was-a-hole-movie-set&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SACHA BARON COHEN DENIES REBEL WILSON&apos;S CLAIM HE WAS AN ‘A--HOLE’ ON MOVIE SET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just feeling humiliated and degraded as a person, I just thought it&apos;s worth sharing in the book because there&apos;s probably a lot of people out there that have had the same experiences,&quot; she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson also claimed that since her allegations about Cohen&apos;s behavior have been getting attention, &quot;I&apos;ve had a lot of women reach out and say that they&apos;ve had similar experiences with this guy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rebel Rising&quot; is set to release April 2, but she&apos;s spoken about the chapter of her book dedicated to Cohen on social media. She originally neglected to name names, instead referring to him as an &quot;a--hole&quot; that she&apos;d worked with, but after he allegedly attempted to stop her from publishing her book, she called him out directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rebel-wilson-vs-sacha-baron-cohen-actress-may-have-signed-pr-deal-with-devil-expert&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REBEL WILSON VS. SACHA BARON COHEN: ACTRESS MAY HAVE SIGNED ‘A PR DEAL WITH THE DEVIL,&apos; EXPERT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I will not be bullied or silenced by high priced lawyers or PR crisis managers,&quot; Wilson wrote on her Instagram story last week. &quot;The ‘a--hole’ that I am talking about in ONE CHAPTER of my book is: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/sacha-baron-cohen-jewish-celebs-rip-tiktok-creating-biggest-antisemitic-movement-since-nazis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sacha Baron Cohen&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Brothers Grimsby,&quot; Wilson and Cohen starred together as a husband and wife of nine kids. Later, Wilson accused Cohen of &quot;harassing&quot; her on the movie set during a radio show interview, according to Variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

Remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sacha-baron-cohen-stop-playing-borat-too-dangerous&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in ‘Borat’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;when I did that naked scene? It was hilarious,’&quot; Wilson said, the outlet reported. &quot;On the last day, I thought I’d obviously won the argument, and he got a body double to do the naked scene.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen allegedly told Wilson to &quot;stick [her] finger up [his] butt&quot; while filming the last scene, despite the move not being included in the script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look, I’ll just pull down my pants. You just stick your finger up my butt. It’ll be a really funny bit,&quot; he allegedly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for Cohen denied her claims, telling Fox News Digital, &quot;While we appreciate the importance of speaking out, these demonstrably false claims are directly contradicted by extensive detailed evidence, including contemporaneous documents, film footage, and eyewitness accounts from those present before, during and after the production of ‘The Brothers Grimsby.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her new interview, Wilson admitted she wasn&apos;t surprised that Cohen is denying her accusations against him, saying, &quot;Obviously, knowing his character, I assumed he would react in this way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Writing a memoir, the book gets fully legally vetted,&quot; she explained, &quot;so obviously there are tons of people to back what I&apos;m saying in the book, the book is 100% honest and truthful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Lauryn Overhultz contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Sarah McNally, an Irish immigrant working at the Céilí House pub in Queens, was allegedly stabbed in the neck by her boyfriend on Saturday as patrons looked on, according to a report.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Shocked merrymakers looked on as the crazed boyfriend of an Irish pub employee allegedly stabbed her multiple times in the neck just after happy hour, leaving her to bleed out and turning the knife on himself, according to a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/ireland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Irish immigrant&lt;/a&gt; Sarah McNally, 41, died on the floor of the Céilí House pub in Queens after the 6:30 p.m. assault on Saturday, a New York Police Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency responders transported a 36-year-old man in &quot;critical condition&quot; with stab wounds to his head and neck to the same hospital where McNally was pronounced dead – the New York Post reported that the man was the bar worker&apos;s boyfriend of several months, and that he injured himself after allegedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;attacking the woman&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McNally was &quot;just standing there talking&quot; when &quot;her [boyfriend] just walked right in and stabbed her,&quot; a female patron told the outlet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/former-nypd-officer-cleared-murder-manslaughter-shooting-childhood-friend&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORMER NYPD OFFICER CLEARED OF MURDER, MANSLAUGHTER IN SHOOTING OF CHILDHOOD FRIEND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then he started trying to stab himself,&quot; she said. &quot;Horrible. Just horrible!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what prompted the barroom slaying. Sources told the outlet that there was no history of domestic violence between the pair before the fatal incident – but he had been arrested for domestic violence before, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; Daily News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charges against the attacker are pending as he recovers from his self-inflicted wounds, the Daily News reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/illinois-stabbing-spree-suspect-charged-murder-rampage-leaves-4-dead-7-injured&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ILLINOIS STABBING SPREE SUSPECT CHARGED WITH MURDER AFTER RAMPAGE LEAVES FOUR DEAD, SEVEN INJURED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patron Mike Green told the outlet that he knew the couple and &quot;still can&apos;t believe it&quot; or &quot;picture it&quot; after the incident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They was always together. M is cool,&quot; Green said, using the boyfriend&apos;s nickname and saying that the couple often hung out at the Maspeth watering hole. &quot;Both of them. That’s why it blew my mind a little bit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sarah is good people,&quot; Green said of the victim. &quot;She helps people. Everybody owes her money.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/jonathan-diller-shooting-nypd-sergeants-union-tells-anti-police-democrats-stay-away-funeral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JONATHAN DILLER SHOOTING: NYPD SERGEANTS&apos; UNION TELLS ANTI-POLICE DEMOCRATS TO STAY AWAY FROM THE FUNERAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources told the Post that the boyfriend held knives in each hand when he was approached by responding police, and that they used stun guns on him when he refused to drop the weapons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McNally was a &quot;sweet, innocent girl from Longford,&quot; a county in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/ireland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;central Ireland,&lt;/a&gt; bar regular Mike Lambe, 62, told the outlet. She had worked at the pub for just a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green told the Daily News that McNally worked as a corrections officer on the Emerald Isle before moving to the States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She was innocent!&quot; said Lambe, who lives just two blocks from the pub, adding that the street has regular issues with drug dealers and users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s been getting worse and worse,&quot; he told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An Israeli airstrike launched at the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria on Monday has killed Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Iran&apos;s Revolutionary Guards Corps&lt;/a&gt;, a Lebanese security source has told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Zahedi, describing him as playing a key role in Iran&apos;s support of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters is reporting that its journalists at the scene in the Syrian capital saw smoke rising from the rubble of a building that was flattened in the airstrike. Israel has not confirmed its involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We do not comment on reports in the foreign media,&quot; an Israeli military spokesperson told Reuters when asked about the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israeli-troops-withdraw-from-shifa-hospital-gaza-idf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISRAELI TROOPS WITHDRAW FROM SHIFA HOSPITAL IN GAZA, IDF SAYS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Monday that &quot;we are in conversations with partners in the region gathering more information, but at this point, don&apos;t have confirmation either of the target or the responsible party.&quot;  White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, also when asked about the reported strike, said &quot;our team is looking into it.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury said in 2010 that Zahedi &quot;has also acted as a liaison to Hezbollah and Syrian intelligence services and is reportedly charged with guaranteeing weapons shipments to Hezbollah.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The airstrike Monday also killed several Iranian diplomats, Reuters is reporting, citing Iranian state media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah and the Israeli military have frequently been engaged in cross-border skirmishes since the onset of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Israel-Hamas war&lt;/a&gt; on Oct. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-announces-thwarting-massive-iranian-operation-smuggle-weapons-palestinians&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISRAEL ANNOUNCES THWARTING OF MASSIVE IRANIAN OPERATION TO SMUGGLE WEAPONS TO PALESTINIANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel said in February that it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-eliminates-hezbollah-senior-commander-terror-group-warns-pay-price&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;killed a senior Hezbollah commander&lt;/a&gt; in a strike carried out in Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Israel Defense Forces had announced at the time that an overnight airstrike targeting a &quot;Hezbollah military structure&quot; in Nabatieh killed Ali Muhammad Aldbas, a senior commander of the Radwan forces. His deputy commander, Ibrahim Issa, and an additional terrorist were killed in the attack, according to the IDF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Thomas Ferraro and Chris Pandolfo contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>D.C. Defenders offensive lineman Jean Delance was unable to stick around for the first UFL game of the season as he was ejected for spitting on an opponent.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;D.C. Defenders offensive lineman Jean Delance appeared in the team’s first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ufl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;United Football League&lt;/a&gt; game against the San Antonio Brahmas, but he didn’t stick around for the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Defenders attempted to come back against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/san-antonio-brahmas-trickery-results-big-man-touchdown-in-ufl-opener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Brahmas&lt;/a&gt;, Delance was ejected in the fourth quarter for spitting at linebacker Delontae Scott. Delance was hit with a &quot;flagrant personal foul&quot; after it appeared the Defenders had scored a touchdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The score was negated after officials said Delance jumped early on the play. He was thrown out and cost the team a touchdown to get back in the game. D.C. had to settle for four field goals and dropped the opener 27-12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/XFL2023/status/1774505314538107107&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW THE MOMENT ON X.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flagrant play, the UFL broadcast showed Scott warning Defenders quarterback Jordan Ta’amu about Delance spitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey, your boy spit on me again, it’s over,&quot; Scott told Ta’amu. &quot;He spit on me again it’s over.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufl-kicker-praises-god-drilling-game-winning-64-yard-field-goal-first-attempt-since-high-school&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;UFL KICKER PRAISES GOD AFTER DRILLING GAME-WINNING 64-YARD FIELD GOAL IN FIRST ATTEMPT SINCE HIGH SCHOOL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brahmas quarterback Chase Garbers was 19-for-25 passing with 152 passing yards and two touchdown passes. He also ran for a touchdown. Jontre Kirklin had eight catches for 61 yards and a touchdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ta’amu was 25-for-45 with 235 passing yards and an interception. Ty Scott led the team in receiving with four catches for 87 yards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D.C. kicker Matthew McCrane had all 12 points for the Defenders. His longest field goal came in the first quarter when he nailed a 28-yarder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/united-football-league-players-may-know-ahead-1st-season&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt; hits the road to take on the Memphis Showboats next week.

                    <title>Lawmakers in several US states propose legislation to allow spiritual chaplains in public schools</title>
                    
                    <description>Lawmakers in several states are proposing legislation to allow chaplains in public schools, aiming to provide spiritual support to students who may not have access.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers in more than a dozen states have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/legislation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;proposed legislation&lt;/a&gt; to allow spiritual chaplains in public schools, a move that proponents say will ease a youth mental health crisis, bolster staff retention and offer spiritual care to students who can’t afford or access religious schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservatives also argue religious foundations will act as a &quot;rescue mission&quot; for what they say are public schools&apos; declining values, a topic that has galvanized Republican-controlled Legislatures to fight for issues such as parental oversight of curriculum, restrictions on books and instruction on gender identity and state-funded tuition assistance for private and religious schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many chaplains and interfaith organizations oppose the chaplaincy campaign, calling the motivation offensive and describing the dangers of introducing a position of authority to children without clear standards or boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They are going to be engaging students, sometimes when they’re at their most vulnerable, and there’s not going to be any checks on whether they’re able to proselytize, what they’re able to say to kids grappling with really difficult issues,&quot; said Maureen O’Leary, organizing director at Interfaith Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organization has shared concerns with lawmakers and school boards, saying schools should be &quot;neutral spaces where students can come as their full selves,&quot; O&apos;Leary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This isn’t a matter of being pro- religion and anti-religion,&quot; she said. &quot;This is a matter of the appropriate role of religion as it applies to public schools.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas became the first state to allow school chaplains under a law passed in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National School Chaplain Association, which identifies itself as a Christian chaplain ministry, says on its website it was &quot;instrumental&quot; in spearheading the Texas law. The organization is a subsidiary of Mission Generation, which was established in 1999 to bring Jesus to classrooms worldwide. In a December 2023 newsletter, NSCA celebrated Texas for starting a &quot;national movement placing God back in public education.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-lawmakers-approve-bill-allowing-public-schools-hire-chaplains-counsel-students&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEXAS LAWMAKERS APPROVE BILL ALLOWING PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO HIRE CHAPLAINS TO COUNSEL STUDENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSCA chaplains &quot;deliver holistic care, guidance, and safety to all people, all the time regardless of their personal beliefs, or non-beliefs&quot; and the organization’s statement of faith is typical of endorsing bodies, an association representative said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bill passed, dozens of Texas chaplains representing different faiths and denominations collectively wrote to school boards, warning the law doesn&apos;t require that &quot;chaplains refrain from proselytizing while at schools or that they serve students from different religious backgrounds.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law ordered more than 1,200 school districts to decide by March 1 whether they would allow chaplains as employees or volunteers. Many of the largest opted out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Houston and Austin said volunteers&apos; roles and responsibilities were unchanged so a volunteer wouldn&apos;t be providing chaplain services. Dallas’ school board said chaplains should not be employees or volunteers at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, varying school chaplain bills have been introduced in many Southern and Midwestern states, with mixed success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A school chaplain bill passed both chambers of the Florida Legislature and awaits Gov. Ron DeSantis&apos;s signature. School policy must describe the services of a volunteer chaplain and require parental consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indiana’s proposal, which passed one chamber but failed in the other, specified chaplains would provide secular services unless student and parents consent to nonsecular services. Some lawmakers questioned where that line would be drawn and how a student would know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Utah, Rep. Keven Stratton told his colleagues recent Supreme Court decisions on religious freedom provide an opportunity for school chaplains and a return to the tradition of acknowledging God in public institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Johnson, his counterpart in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/utah&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Utah Senate&lt;/a&gt;, where the proposal ultimately failed without full GOP support, said he observed an &quot;outright disdain for religious principles within our schools&quot; during committee meetings. He said that would have consequences such as more families choosing alternatives to public school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It would be helpful and much easier if my colleagues would take our efforts here not as an attack but as a rescue mission,&quot; he said on the Senate floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, proposals from then- President Donald Trump to stategoverningbodies have intended to crack the firewall between church and public schools, an effort that civil liberties groups say undermines equal treatment of all faiths and threatens religious minorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public schools have been barred from leading students in classroom prayer since 1962, when the Supreme Court ruled it was a violation of the First Amendment clause forbidding the establishment of a government religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court case brought by a coach fired for praying on the field addressed the balance between the religious and free speech rights of teachers and staff and the rights of students not to feel coerced into religious practices. The decision to back a praying football coach aligned with a series of rulings in favor of religious plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chaplains, traditionally a clergyperson ministering outside of a congregation, have long served in the U.S. But the modern role is &quot;very gray,&quot; said Wendy Cadge, director of the Chaplaincy Innovation Lab at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, in that it&apos;s not uniform or universally understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chaplains serve in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.S. Congress&lt;/a&gt;, military, and correctional facilities, and each has rigorous requirements for hiring and service. Hospitals, police and fire departments, colleges and private companies also hire chaplains with wide-ranging standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many chaplains have seminary or ministry training in and the endorsement of a particular faith. But chaplains serving in multicultural places also may be required to bring professional, supervised training called clinical pastoral education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major hospitals are especially likely to employ chaplains with, and offer training in, clinical pastoral education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients and their families are regularly experiencing existential crises and are vulnerable, said Eric Johnson, director of spiritual care at UnityPoint Health’s Des Moines-area hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The training helps chaplains learn how to serve untethered to their faith so &quot;transference or reactivity doesn’t get in the way of really attending to people’s needs,&quot; Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hip-hop mogul Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs won&apos;t be able to buy his way out of trouble if the federal sex-trafficking probe against him uncovers any crimes, according to a former investigator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the Bad Boy Records founder&apos;s mansions were raided last week after a series of damning civil lawsuits accused him of trafficking sex, guns and drugs and other bad behavior. He settled the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-settles-lawsuit-one-day-after-ex-girlfriend-cassies-allegations-years-rape&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;first lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, from R&amp;amp;B singer Cassie, his ex-girlfriend whose real name is Casandra Ventura, a day after she filed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after she came forward, so did at least three women and a man, including a female who would have been under 18 at the time of her alleged sex assault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You can pay off folks in civil lawsuits to make them go away,&quot; said Nicole Parker, a former FBI agent. &quot;But that doesn’t work in a sound criminal investigation – especially on a federal level when it comes to sex trafficking allegations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-accused-male-music-producer-sexual-assault&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEAN ‘DIDDY’ COMBS ACCUSED BY MALE MUSIC PRODUCER OF SEXUAL ASSAULT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homeland Security Investigations agents descended on Combs&apos; mansions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/los-angeles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; and Miami in connection with what law enforcement sources told Fox News Digital is a sex-trafficking probe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;After the Epstein debacle, folks know you won’t be able to just make these cases disappear,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if the case goes to criminal court, there won&apos;t be a non-disclosure agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derrick Parker, a former member of the NYPD&apos;s rap-related intelligence unit whose book &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Notorious-C-P-Investigations-Hip-Hop/dp/0312352514&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Notorious C.O.P.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; delved into detail about and 1999 shooting in which Combs was acquitted at trial, predicted that more accusers will come forward and share their stories with investigators as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some of it may be a money grab because maybe he was disrespectful, but they saw the way that he paid Cassie off,&quot; he told Fox News Digital. &quot;Cassie got paid quick, and the reason that she got paid quick is because she knows a lot.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The raids came weeks after music producer Rodney Jones&apos; lawsuit accused Combs of all kinds of misdeeds, including sexual grooming, covering up a studio shooting and allegedly bragging about &quot;having law enforcement under control,&quot; &quot;murdering people&quot; and bribing witnesses and jurors in a high-profile New York City nightclub shooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rapper-sean-diddy-combs-homes-raided-homeland-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;RAPPER SEAN &apos;DIDDY&apos; COMBS&apos; HOMES RAIDED BY HOMELAND SECURITY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combs and his then-girlfriend, the pop megastar Jennifer Lopez, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;were arrested&lt;/a&gt; after a December 1999 shooting at Club New York left three people injured. Lopez was never charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combs and another man were acquitted at trial. But his friend and protege, the rapper Jamal &quot;Shyne&quot; Barrow, served a decade in prison for assault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-lawsuit-names-50-cents-ex-girlfriend-one-music-moguls-alleged-sex-workers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEAN &apos;DIDDY&apos; COMBS LAWSUIT NAMES 50 CENT&apos;S EX-GIRLFRIEND AS ONE OF MUSIC MOGUL&apos;S ALLEGED SEX WORKERS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones&apos; lawsuit alleges that Lopez snuck a gun into the club for Combs and handed it to her boyfriend before gunfire erupted and injured three people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A surviving victim, Natania Reuben, told NewsNation last week that she watched Combs shoot her in the face – not Barrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-life-star-island-exclusive-miami-enclave-billionaires-a-listers-call-home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEAN ‘DIDDY’ COMBS&apos; LIFE ON STAR ISLAND: EXCLUSIVE MIAMI ENCLAVE BILLIONAIRES, A-LISTERS CALL HOME&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I literally watched them pull out the guns,&quot; she told the station. &quot;I had a clear point of view. I mean, for God&apos;s sake, I got shot in my nose.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s unlikely that Combs could be in trouble for the nightclub shooting, Parker said, because there&apos;s typically no federal nexus for a local gunfight, especially after he was already acquitted at trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-federal-raids-homes-sexual-misconduct-lawsuits-what-to-know&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEAN ‘DIDDY’ COMBS&apos; FEDERAL RAIDS ON HOMES, SEXUAL MISCONDUCT LAWSUITS: WHAT TO KNOW&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other evidence from the civil lawsuits likely played a role in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;federal investigation&lt;/a&gt; and could turn out to be crucial in a potential criminal case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They’ll use a lot of the same evidence to build their case,&quot; she said. &quot;Anyone is innocent until proven guilty, but the evidence is mounting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-declares-innocence-after-federal-agents-raid-his-homes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEAN ‘DIDDY’ COMBS DECLARES INNOCENCE AFTER FEDERAL AGENTS RAID HIS HOMES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ventura, in her settled lawsuit, had also accused Combs of forcing her to carry a gun for him. Jones alleged that the mogul was often &quot;displaying and distributing guns&quot; in his presence in order to &quot;maintain dominion and control&quot; over other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combs and his lawyers have denied all allegations of wrongdoing. The billionaire has also characterized the accusations against him as attempts for his accusers to secure a &quot;quick payday.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has not been arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photographs taken over the weekend show him in and around his waterfront Miami mansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lil Rod (Rodney Jones) is nothing more than a liar who filed a $30 million lawsuit shamelessly looking for an undeserved payday,&quot; Combs&apos; attorney Shawn Holley &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-lawsuit-names-50-cents-ex-girlfriend-one-music-moguls-alleged-sex-workers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;previously told&lt;/a&gt; Fox News Digital. &quot;His reckless name-dropping about events that are pure fiction and simply did not happen is nothing more than a transparent attempt to garner headlines.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Controversial Grand Canyon uranium mining proceeds as US seeks to reduce reliance on Russian supply</title>
                    
                    <description>A uranium mine south of the Grand Canyon faces backlash from a nearby Native American community, highlighting controversy over nuclear projects as Biden seeks to increase nuclear power.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The largest uranium producer in the United States is ramping up work just south of Grand Canyon National Park on a long-contested project that comes as global instability and growing demand drive uranium prices higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration and dozens of other countries have pledged to triple the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/world-leaders-delegations-meet-brussels-promote-nuclear-energy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;capacity of nuclear power&lt;/a&gt; worldwide in their battle against climate change, and policy changes are being adopted by some to lessen Russia&apos;s influence over the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as the U.S. pursues its nuclear power potential, environmentalists and Native American leaders remain fearful of the consequences for communities near mining and milling sites in the West and are demanding more regulatory oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-provide-1-5b-loan-restart-michigan-nuclear-plant&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN ADMIN TO PROVIDE $1.5B LOAN TO RESTART MICHIGAN NUCLEAR PLANT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new mining at Pinyon Plain Mine near the Grand Canyon is happening within the boundaries of the Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukv National Monument that was designated in August by President Joe Biden. The work was allowed to move forward since Energy Fuels Inc. had valid existing rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low impact with zero risk to groundwater is how Energy Fuels spokesman Curtis Moore describes the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mine will cover 17 acres and operate for just a few years, producing at least 2 million pounds of uranium — enough to power the state of Arizona for at least a year with carbon-free electricity, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As the global outlook for clean, carbon-free nuclear energy strengthens and the U.S. moves away from Russian uranium supply, the demand for domestically sourced uranium is growing,&quot; Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy Fuels, which also is prepping two more mines in Colorado and Wyoming, was awarded a contract in 2022 to sell $18.5 million in uranium concentrates to the U.S. government to help establish the nation’s strategic reserve for when supplies might be disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the growing appetite for uranium, a coalition of Native Americans testified before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in late February, asking the panel to pressure the U.S. government to overhaul outdated mining laws and prevent further exploitation of marginalized communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carletta Tilousi, who served for years on the Havasupai Tribal Council, said she and others have written countless letters to state and federal agencies and have sat through hours of meetings with regulators and lawmakers. Her tribe’s reservation lies in a gorge off the Grand Canyon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have been diligently participating in consultation processes,&quot; she said. &quot;They hear our voices. There’s no response.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/leaders-nuclear-fusion-meet-dc-raise-money-race-against-china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEADERS IN NUCLEAR FUSION MEET IN DC TO RAISE MONEY IN RACE AGAINST CHINA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous legal challenges aimed at stopping the Pinyon Plain Mine have repeatedly been rejected by the courts, and top officials in the Biden administration are reticent to weigh in beyond speaking generally about efforts to improve consultation with Native American tribes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s just the latest battle over energy development and sacred lands, as tribes in Nevada and Arizona are fighting the federal government over the mining of lithium and the siting of renewable energy transmission lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Havasupai are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/lithium-extraction-project-using-colorado-river-worries-utah-residents-rely-water&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;concerned mining could affect water supplies&lt;/a&gt;, wildlife, plants and geology throughout the Colorado Plateau, and the Colorado River flowing through the Grand Canyon and its tributaries are vital to millions of people across the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Havasupai, their water comes from aquifers deep below the mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pinyon Plain Mine, formerly known as the Canyon Mine, was permitted in 1984. With existing rights, it was grandfathered into legal operation despite a 20-year moratorium placed on uranium mining in the Grand Canyon region by the Obama administration in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Forest Service in 2012 reaffirmed an environmental impact statement that had been prepared for the mine years earlier, and state regulators signed off on air and aquifer protection permitting within the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We work extremely hard to do our work at the highest standards,&quot; Moore said. &quot;And it’s upsetting that we’re vilified like we are. The things we’re doing are backed by science and the regulators.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regional aquifers feeding the springs at the bottom of the Grand Canyon are deep — around 1,000 feet below the mine — and separated by nearly impenetrable rock, Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State regulators also have said the area&apos;s geology is expected to provide an element of natural protection against water from the site migrating toward the Grand Canyon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, environmentalists say the mine raises bigger questions about the Biden administration’s willingness to adopt favorable nuclear power policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using nuclear power to reach emissions goals is a hard sell in the western U.S. From the Navajo Nation to Ute Mountain Ute and Oglala Lakota homelands, tribal communities have deep-seated distrust of uranium companies and the federal government as abandoned mines and related contamination have yet to be cleaned up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor McKinnon, the Center for Biological Diversity’s Southwest director, said allowing mining near the Grand Canyon &quot;makes a mockery of the administration’s environmental justice rhetoric.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s literally a black eye for the Biden administration,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teracita Keyanna with the Red Water Pond Road Community Association got choked up while testifying before the human rights commission in Washington, D.C., saying federal regulators proposed keeping onsite soil contaminated by past operations in New Mexico rather than removing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s really unfair that we have to deal with this and my children have to deal with this and later on, my grandchildren have to deal with this,&quot; she said. &quot;Why is the government just feeling like we’re disposable? We’re not.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Congress, some lawmakers who come from communities blighted by past contamination are digging in their heels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congresswoman Cori Bush of Missouri said during a congressional meeting in January that lawmakers can’t talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/nuclear&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;expanding nuclear energy&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. without first dealing with the effects that nuclear waste has had on minority communities. In Bush&apos;s district in St. Louis, waste was left behind from the uranium refining required by the top-secret Manhattan Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have a responsibility to both fix — and learn from — our mistakes,&quot; she said, &quot;before we risk subjecting any other communities to the same exposure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We see surveillance cameras, cell phone cameras, home ring cameras. The things that I love about this, [it&apos;s] not just the crimes that you see.

                    <title>Ex-ASPCA chief advocates for local donations, alleges major groups ignore shelters&apos; needs</title>
                    
                    <description>Former ASPCA CEO Ed Sayres told Fox News Digital he encourages those who value supporting their local animal shelters to donate in their community instead of giving to larger groups.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;ASPCA&apos;s former CEO and the godfather behind its iconic Sarah McLachlan ad is encouraging animal lovers to donate locally as he calls out what he views as large animal welfare organizations&apos; failures to support shelters hit hard in the post-pandemic age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For ASPCA, 2% [of proceeds go to local shelters]. So, if you have the visual dollar bill, you would have to tell donors who are donating to such organizations that one penny or two pennies will go to [local shelters],&quot; Ed Sayres told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/special/20th-anniversary/fox-news-digital&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt; on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sayres says his background compels him to advocate for these local establishments that are grappling with an influx of homeless animals while lacking resources to provide adequate care for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now serving as a senior adviser to the Center for the Environment and Welfare (CEW) think tank based in Washington, D.C., Sayres says his focus remains on calling attention to America&apos;s pet shelter crisis and dispelling some commonly-held yet false beliefs about large organizations he says have left local shelters behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aspca-gives-2-budget-pet-shelters-hoarding-millions-pushing-anti-farmer-agenda-think-tank&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ASPCA GIVES 2% OF BUDGET TO PET SHELTERS WHILE ‘HOARDING’ MILLIONS, PUSHING ‘ANTI-FARMER’ AGENDA: THINK TANK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Most donors believe their donations are going locally because they think of those names [of animal welfare groups] as you would think of United Way, that you donate locally through this national umbrella, and it&apos;s not the case,&quot; he continued. &quot;It&apos;s actually brand confusion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many mistakenly assume the ASPCA and other large &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/animal-welfare-groups-biden-admin-address-thousands-abandoned-dogs-border&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;animal welfare groups&lt;/a&gt; function as umbrella organizations – or organizations that control or provide resources to smaller affiliates, but even some note otherwise themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ASPCA&apos;s Frequently Asked Questions page on its website even clarifies this by writing, &quot;We are not an umbrella organization; we do not directly oversee or operate local shelters or rescues, except in New York where the ASPCA Adoption Center is located.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some might confuse local SPCA chapters as affiliates of the ASPCA, though they operate independently and rely on donations. Houston SPCA &lt;a href=&quot;https://houstonspca.org/aspca-vs-spca-whats-the-difference/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;dispelled this myth&lt;/a&gt; on its website in 2021, writing, &quot;While many people believe that the ASPCA funds local shelters like Houston SPCA, no SPCA across the country is part of the ASPCA organization.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/euthanized-tiger-100-animals-seized-virginia-zoo-faces-animal-welfare-investigation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;EUTHANIZED TIGER AMONG MORE THAN 100 ANIMALS SEIZED AS VIRGINIA ZOO FACES ANIMAL WELFARE INVESTIGATION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Rogers, president of New York&apos;s Nassau County SPCA, similarly told CBS News the same year that these independent groups are not funded by the ASPCA, stating, &quot;We receive no money from them at all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sayres, meanwhile, told Fox News Digital that his background compelled him to focus on distributing resources locally when he came to the ASPCA in 2003, and he focused on a grant program to aid local shelters. He says, however, that focus has shifted in the years since he stepped down in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The concern is post-COVID, shelters are really struggling. Shelters need resources,&quot; he said, adding shortly after, &quot;You would think, knowing there&apos;s a bit of a brand confusion, knowing shelters are needing resources and, bottom line, money saves lives, you would think maybe this was the time to get this program started again.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He later explained that families&apos; financial struggles inhibit them from adopting pets, meaning bad economic situations only exacerbate animal shelters&apos; existing problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack Hubbard, executive director of CEW, similarly weighed in on the accusations the ASPCA faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Many donors who have seen the sad Sarah McLachlan-style TV ads are shocked to learn that the ASPCA only gives 2% of its budget to local pet shelters. To make matters worse, they are sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars in investments while paying their CEO over $1 million. We continue to ask the CEO of the ASPCA to reduce his pay and immediately distribute their investment accounts to local shelters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/dogs-cats-roam-free-first-cageless-animal-shelter-us-opens-arkansas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DOGS AND CATS ROAM FREE AS FIRST CAGELESS ANIMAL SHELTER IN US OPENS IN ARKANSAS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hoarding hundreds of millions of dollars while neglecting local pet shelters just isn&apos;t right.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, CEW launched a paid media campaign to &quot;expose the duplicity&quot; of the ASPCA, alleging the nonprofit is more focused on lining its pockets as opposed to helping local pets in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://environmentandwelfare.com/app/uploads/2023/04/CEW_RealASPCA_Report-1.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;CEW sources&lt;/a&gt; provided to Fox News Digital cite the ASPCA&apos;s recent tax filings as the source of its numbers indicating that only 2% of the organization&apos;s budget goes to local shelters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to copies of 2022 ASPCA tax documents CEW additionally provided, CEO Matt Berkshadker raked in over $1 million while many others made six figures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The think tank&apos;s assertions appear to correlate with findings from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aspca-spending-donor-cbs-news-investigation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;CBS News&apos; 2021 report&lt;/a&gt; indicating the organization had raised $2 billion for animal welfare since 2008, but had, in that time, spent approximately 7% in grants to local welfare groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlet&apos;s investigation additionally uncovered that the group spent nearly three times as much on fundraising efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for ASPCA, when reached for comment on CEW&apos;s accusations from a report last year, told Fox News Digital, &quot;For more than 155 years, the ASPCA has been actively pursuing our mission to provide effective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals throughout the United States. All of our lifesaving work is dedicated to rescuing, protecting, and caring for animals in need.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the organization for additional comment, and received the following statement in response:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a false and misleading narrative, peddled by a PR firm paid to discredit the ASPCA’s work to end animal suffering across the country. Based on our most recent tax filings, 76 cents of every dollar spent by the ASPCA goes toward programmatic services that directly advance our lifesaving mission, with the majority of that funding supporting shelters and rescues across the country, including our animal relocation program – the largest in the country – where we move tens of thousands of homeless pets each year from overcrowded shelters to areas of the country where they can be adopted into loving homes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Under current leadership, the ASPCA has evolved and expanded our work to bring even greater urgency and impact to tackling the root causes of animal homelessness and suffering. Every year, our hands-on work – in addition to our partnerships with hundreds of local shelters and rescues – directly impacts hundreds of thousands of animals, with our lasting solutions benefiting millions more that we cannot serve through local partnerships and grant funding alone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Editor&apos;s Note: This piece has been updated to include a statement from ASPCA.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Houston Keene and Aaron Kleigman contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Former RNC chair Reince Priebus, an ABC contributor, called out NBC News on Sunday for its “huge failure&amp;quot; in the wake of the Ronna McDaniel firing scandal.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former RNC chair Reince Priebus called out NBC News on Sunday for its &quot;huge failure&quot; in the hiring and firing of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nbc-news-decision-part-ronna-mcdaniel-looks-soft-weak-and-scared-soccer-great-alexi-lalas-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ronna McDaniel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDaniel stepped down as head of the RNC on March 8, only to become the center of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;media world&lt;/a&gt; controversy after she joined NBC News as a contributor, only to have her contract terminated by the company amid backlash from employees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priebus, who is an ABC contributor, said that NBC flubbed the hiring of McDaniel on &quot;This Week.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-nbc-leaders-caught-flat-footed-touch-staff-ronna-mcdaniel-fiasco-insider&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MSNBC, NBC LEADERS WERE CAUGHT FLAT-FOOTED, OUT OF TOUCH WITH STAFF ON RONNA MCDANIEL FIASCO: INSIDER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The case on Ronna that I find to be obvious for someone like me who’s a contributor here, I&apos;ve been at other places — I’ve never been hired without the management bringing me in, meeting with people, doing interviews where I wasn’t on a signed contract, finding out whether I could get off the talking points or not,&quot; Priebus said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The root of the problem is that the management never brought [McDaniel] in before the contract was signed so that all of this stuff could get worked out, and that was a huge failure in my opinion,&quot; he continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Donna Brazile said that she didn&apos;t have a response to McDaniel&apos;s firing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;I didn’t understand the hiring,&quot; Brazile said. &quot;So I have none. But I’ve enjoyed every year of my life being on shows like this and cable television.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Good luck to her,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to NBC News for comment but has yet to receive a response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/nbc-news-officially-drops-ronna-mcdaniel-following-staff-backlash&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NBC NEWS OFFICIALLY DROPS RONNA MCDANIEL FOLLOWING ON-AIR BACKLASH FROM STAFF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly one week after proudly announcing the hiring of McDaniel, the former chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, as a paid analyst, NBC is still reeling after an unprecedented tongue-lashing from its own stars, media critics and even prominent Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDaniel is seeking all $600,000 from her lucrative contract. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/conservatives-pile-nbc-news-dropping-ronna-mcdaniel-days-after-hiring-gotta-be-a-new-record&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Republicans and conservatives&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; observing the fiasco were left with even less trust in NBC News and the media writ large than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former high-ranking MSNBC executive previously told Fox News Digital, &quot;There’s now an obvious line drawn between NBC/MSNBC anchors and correspondents, and the executives who oversee them. The talent doesn’t trust the execs and the execs don’t trust the talent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; David Rutz and Brian Flood contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Seven endangered turtles recently hatched at a Tennessee aquarium. The Arakan forest turtles are considered critically endangered. Fox News Digital spoke with herpetology coordinator Bill Hughes.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A bale of Arakan forest turtles — a critically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/endangered-species&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;endangered species&lt;/a&gt; — were welcomed to the world recently at an aquarium in Tennessee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tennessee Aquarium in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Chattanooga, Tennessee,&lt;/a&gt; announced the arrival of seven hatchlings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aquarium put out a press release with the good news and shared that it’s rare for all seven of the eggs that were laid to fully emerge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/rare-animals-arrival-will-help-reveal-secrets-of-one-of-least-known-species-on-the-planet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RARE ANIMAL&apos;S ARRIVAL WILL HELP REVEAL SECRETS ‘OF ONE OF LEAST-KNOWN SPECIES ON THE PLANET’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aquarium herpetology coordinator Bill Hughes told Fox News Digital that welcoming all seven turtles from the laid eggs was exciting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is excitement here any time a turtle hatches, but the rarity and conservation status of the Arakan forest turtles makes this recent event even more exciting,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aquarium said the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Arakan forest turtles&lt;/a&gt; are endangered due to habitat destruction in Myanmar and Bangladesh and the &quot;unwelcomed attention of illegal traffickers supplying the pet trade and food markets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/exotic-animals-across-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHERE TO HAVE UP-CLOSE ENCOUNTERS WITH EXOTIC ANIMALS ACROSS AMERICA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The turtles’ population has decreased 80% over the last 75 years, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new arrivals in Tennessee are considered the largest group of Arakan forest turtles ever to hatch at a facility accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), according to the Tennessee Aquarium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aquarium added that these turtles can only be found at six facilities nationwide due to their rarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time the Tennessee Aquarium has stuck gold with birthing new Arakan forest turtles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/rare-two-headed-snake-undergoes-surgery-missouri&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RARE TWO-HEADED SNAKE UNDERGOES SURGERY IN MISSOURI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the aquarium welcomed its first-ever Arakans ­— two turtles that emerged from six eggs that were laid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last year alone, Hughes said that the population of Arakan forest turtles in AZA facilities like its own has increased over 25%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These hatchlings increase the number of individuals in AZA facilities by over 25%, which helps the long-term viability of this population, and each of these hatchlings helps ensure the continued existence of this critically endangered species,&quot; he told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hughes said in a press release that &quot;having a viable population spread across zoos and aquariums is important.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, &quot;Then, if something happened to the last few in the wild, they wouldn’t totally be extinct.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot;

said the same organization. &quot;This turtle has been observed burrowing under leaves during the hottest parts of the day, and is largely active at night.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot;
