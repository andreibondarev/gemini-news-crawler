                    <title>Austria says it must deter Russian infiltration after allegations of spying emerge</title>
                    
                    <description>After a former Austrian intelligence officer was arrested for allegedly spying for Russia, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said Austria needs to boost its security to prevent Russian infiltration.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;VIENNA (AP) — The arrest in recent days of a former Austrian intelligence officer on serious allegations of spying for Russia suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/austria-seeks-explanation-from-germany-about-spying-reports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; needs to boost its security to thwart Russian infiltration, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The allegations against Egisto Ott, who worked for a now-defunct intelligence agency and whose arrest was announced Friday, are &quot;grave&quot; and have prompted Nehammer to call a meeting next week of Austria’s National Security Council, the chancellor said. Ott has denied wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/austrian-ex-officer-suspected-of-spying-for-russia-since-90s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUSTRIAN EX-OFFICER SUSPECTED OF SPYING FOR RUSSIA SINCE 90S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On the one hand, these allegations have to be addressed by the judiciary. On the other hand, an evaluation and clarification of the security situation of the republic is needed,&quot; Nehammer said in a statement. &quot;We have to avoid having Russian spy networks threaten our country by infiltrating or instrumentalizing political parties and networks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nehammer said he would convene the National Security Council on Tuesday of next week. The council, which consists of government ministers as well as members of all political parties, is a key advisory panel on matters of security and defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/vienna-court-convicts-alleged-accomplices-2020-islamic-state-shooting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; Criminal Court on Monday approved a 14-day extension for holding Ott in custody on the charges against him. The Vienna public prosecutor’s office declined to provide details about the spying allegations, but said that they relate to &quot;abuse of office&quot; and were &quot;detrimental to Austria.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain has arrested five Bulgarian citizens last year and a sixth one in February and has charged them with allegedly being members of a Russian spy network working together with Jan Marsalek, the fugitive former chief operating officer of Wirecard, the German payment processing company that collapsed in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joint reporting by Der Spiegel, German public broadcaster ZDF, the Austrian newspaper Der Standard and the Russian investigative platform The Insider said last month that Ott and another former Austrian intelligence officer are suspected of having spied on potential targets in Europe and having passed the information to Jan Marsalek, who they allege has had connections to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/moscow-attack-shows-putins-grip-russia-not-nearly-as-tight-as-we-think-says-ex-us-ambassador-ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; intelligence since at least 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also reported that Ott and his colleague allegedly helped Marsalek secretly escape from Austria in a private jet in 2020 after the Wirecard collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ott rejected the accusations against him as baseless in a recent interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been previous allegations against Ott. In 2017, Western intelligence agencies warned their Austrian counterparts about Ott potentially spying for Russia. Ott was suspended from his job at the BVT in 2017 and was briefly arrested in 2021, but he was released again after a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austria expelled two Russian diplomats from Russia’s embassy in Vienna last month in what Austrian officials said was related to spying.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Migrants in Iowa consider leaving over a bill that could see some arrested and deported</title>
                    
                    <description>Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds is expected to sign a bill that would allow for some migrants to be arrested and deported by the state; immigrant and Latino groups are organizing meetings to discuss.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — A bill in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/iowa-travel-guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; that would allow the state to arrest and deport some migrants is stoking anxiety among immigrant communities, leaving some to wonder: &quot;Should I leave Iowa?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation, which is expected to be signed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/iowa-gov-reynolds-desantis-aim-trump-over-misleading-tv-ad&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Gov. Kim Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;, would make it a state crime for a person to be in Iowa if previously denied admission to or removed from the United States. It mirrors part of a Texas law that is currently blocked in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/midwest-state-verge-defying-biden-texas-style-bill-combat-illegal-immigration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIDWEST STATE ON VERGE OF DEFYING BIDEN WITH TEXAS-STYLE BILL TO COMBAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across Iowa, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/iowa-latinos-emerging-as-small-but-potentially-significant-political-force&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Latino&lt;/a&gt; and immigrant community groups are organizing informational meetings and materials to try to answer people&apos;s questions. They’re also asking local and county law enforcement agencies for official statements, as well as face-to-face meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As 80 people gathered in a Des Moines public library community room last week, community organizer Fabiola Schirrmeister pulled written questions out of a tin can. In Spanish, one asked: &quot;Is it safe to call the police?&quot; Another asked: &quot;Can Iowa police ask me about my immigration status?&quot; And: &quot;What happens if I’m racially profiled?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erica Johnson, executive director of Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, the organization hosting the meeting, sighed when one person asked: &quot;Should I leave Iowa?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Entiendo el sentido,&quot; she said. I understand the sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schirrmeister, who hosts a local Spanish-language radio show, explained how long organizers have worked to build a bridge with law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s sad how it’s going to hurt the trust between local enforcement, pro-immigrant organizations and the immigrant communities,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Des Moines Police Chief Dana Wingert told The Associated Press in an email that immigration status does not factor into the department&apos;s work to keep the community safe, and he said it would be &quot;disingenuous and contradictory&quot; to incorporate it at the same time law enforcement has been working to eliminate such bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m not interested, nor are we equipped, funded or staffed to take on additional responsibilities that historically have never been a function of local law enforcement,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Iowa and across the country, Republican leaders have rallied around the refrain that &quot;every state is a border state&quot; as they accuse President Joe Biden of neglecting his responsibilities to enforce federal immigration law. That’s led Republican governors to send troops to support Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s Operation Lone Star, and legislatures to propose a variety of state-level strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iowa’s lawmakers advanced the measure to address what one lawmaker called a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; posed to Iowans by some migrants crossing the southern border. Republican Rep. Steve Holt acknowledged questions of constitutionality around the bill but ultimately argued that Iowa has &quot;the right, the duty and the moral obligation to act to protect our citizens and our sovereignty.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If we end up in a court battle with the federal government, should this pass, bring it on,&quot; Holt said during a subcommittee meeting in February. &quot;I think it’s time for every state to stand up and say … ‘we’ve had enough. We will defend our people.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas law is stalled in court, after a challenge from the U.S. Department of Justice, which says it conflicts with the federal government’s immigration authority. The department did not immediately comment on the Iowa bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iowa legislation, like the Texas law, could mean criminal charges for people who have outstanding deportation orders or who have previously been removed from or denied admission to the U.S. Once in custody, migrants could either agree to a judge’s order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge’s order must identify the transportation method for leaving the U.S. and a law enforcement officer or Iowa agency to monitor migrants&apos; departures. Those who don’t leave could face rearrest under more serious charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill in Iowa faces the same questions of implementation and enforcement as the Texas law, since deportation is a &quot;complicated, expensive and often dangerous&quot; federal process, said immigration law expert Huyen Pham of Texas A&amp;amp;M School of Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How are Iowa law enforcement agencies going to determine if someone has entered Iowa in violation of an immigration order?&quot; Pham asked. She said questions remain about which country a detained person would be sent back to, how they would get there and how agencies would communicate with those countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deportations are a binational process, she said, meaning the federal government negotiates with the governments of other countries. Disjointed immigration policy state-by-state could threaten those international relationships, Pham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico has already said that it would reject any state or local government enforcement of immigration laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iowa State Patrol, as well as representatives of multiple police departments and county sheriff’s offices across the state, declined to comment on the bill before it is signed into law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shawn Ireland, president of the Iowa State Sheriff’s and Deputies Association and a deputy sheriff in Linn County, said in an email that law enforcement officials would consult with county attorneys for guidance if the bill becomes law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ireland added that community-police relations are a priority, and law enforcement’s focus &quot;is not on looking for people who came to this country illegally and are not committing crimes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manny Galvez, leader of the Escucha Mi Voz (Hear My Voice) community group based in the rural city of West Liberty, said the bill has galvanized immigrant communities, including some that are in harder-to-reach areas of Iowa, to send the message that immigration is a human issue and that the state’s meatpacking plants, cornfields and construction projects rely on immigrant labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers advancing a bill like this one are disconnected from that reality, Galvez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Criminalizing the immigrant community is not the answer,&quot; he said. &quot;We tell people: ‘Don’t be afraid. No tengan miedo. We are going to keep fighting this.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Luis Duran-Ruano, 31, was shot and mortally wounded by Indianapolis police Sunday night, following a standoff with a SWAT team on the city&amp;apos;s west side.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Indianapolis police fatally shot a man after he fired shots following a standoff with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;SWAT team&lt;/a&gt;, police said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man was taken to a hospital Sunday night where he later died, police said. He was identified as Luis Duran-Ruano, 31, by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Marion County Coroner&apos;s Office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police were called to the city&apos;s west side around 7:30 p.m. about a man reportedly firing shots into the air, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/seven-juveniles-wounded-downtown-indianapolis-shooting-police-say&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEVEN JUVENILES WOUNDED IN DOWNTOWN INDIANAPOLIS SHOOTING, POLICE SAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officers tried to stop the man from driving away in a car but he led them on a brief pursuit that ended outside a home. The man then got out of the car armed with a gun, which he held to his head, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A SWAT team was called to the scene and a sergeant began communicating with the man, trying to get him to put the gun down. But after about an hour, police said the man began walking away from the home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When SWAT team officers fired bean bag rounds, the suspect then fired gunshots and three officers returned fire, fatally wounding the man, police said. Officers recovered a gun at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shooting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance/investigations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;will be investigated&lt;/a&gt; by an IMPD Critical Incident Response Team and internal affairs. The officers who fired their guns have been placed on administrative leave, police said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Three girls have been arrested and charged for allegedly beating a 64-year-old Washington, DC man to death in October 2023, police announced on Friday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Three young girls have been arrested and charged in connection with the death of a 64-year-old man in northwest Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metropolitan Police Department officers responded to the 6200 block of Georgia Avenue just before 1 a.m. on Oct. 17, 2023, for a report of a man down, according to a press release. Upon arrival, officers found Brown with trauma consistent with an assault. He died at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was just a quiet, nice, polite person. He didn’t bother anybody. That’s the type of person he was,&quot; a close family friend told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fox5dc.com/news/12-year-old-murder-suspect-injured-in-separate-shooting-in-dc-family-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;FOX 5 DC&lt;/a&gt;. Local reports said Brown was physically handicapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspects, whose names are being withheld due to their age, are accused of beating to death the man, who police identified as Reggie Brown. Video played in court Friday showed the beating, local NBC4 reported. A medical examiner&apos;s autopsy revealed he died of blunt force trauma and the manner of death was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ruled a homicide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/dc-suspect-tries-setting-union-stations-freedom-bell-fire-police-investigating&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC SUSPECT TRIES SETTING UNION STATION&apos;S FREEDOM BELL ON FIRE; POLICE INVESTIGATING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, a 13-year-old girl was arrested and charged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;second-degree murder&lt;/a&gt; in connection with Brown&apos;s death. On Friday, a 13-year-old girl and a 12-year-old girl were also arrested and charged with second-degree murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A relative of the 12-year-old girl charged with killing Brown told FOX 5 the girl was shot Friday morning inside her apartment, which is about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/washington-dc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;four blocks away&lt;/a&gt; from where Brown was murdered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/dc-business-owner-slams-city-leaders-out-control-crime-lack-courage-aggressive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC BUSINESS OWNER SLAMS CITY LEADERS FOR OUT-OF-CONTROL CRIME: &apos;LACK COURAGE&apos; TO &apos;BE MORE AGGRESSIVE&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She [is] going to come through. It’s just a lot going on right now,&quot; they said. &quot;This happened around 3 in the morning. I ain’t even get no sleep.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl is expected to survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metropolitan police say the case remains under investigation and the department is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information. Anyone with information about this case is asked to call the police at 202-727-9099. Anonymous information may be submitted to the department’s text tip line by sending a text message to 50411.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three suspects reportedly have long-standing truancy issues — one allegedly did not attend a single day of classes in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As early as this week, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser could propose a plan to hold parents in the district accountable if their children miss too many school days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some residents are hoping that addressing the district’s truancy issue could help reduce juvenile crime, which has skyrocketed. A report released by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education in November said that in the 2022-2023 school year, 60% of D.C. high school students were chronically absent, meaning they were absent either all day or part of the day at least 10% of school days.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

He leaves behind a wife and son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Please keep James’ loved ones and his firefighter family in your thoughts and prayers,&quot; State Forester Rob Farrell said in a statement. &quot;And remember, everything you do to prevent wildfires helps protect our brave first responders.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blaze was contained Saturday. The cause is under investigation, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A small business owner is standing up for the local community in Oakland, California, after she revealed that her store was vandalized and broken into on Easter.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A small business owner in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Oakland, California&lt;/a&gt;, revealed that her store was vandalized and broken into on Easter Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We need the city to take action and prevent this from happening to us,&quot; owner Taylor Jay said, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/oakland-retail-store-burglarized-owner-announces/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;KRON4 report&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;This is not fair. This is Easter Sunday, this is a Sunday we should all be spending time with our loved ones and enjoying this day, not having to clean up glass.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theft occurred at about 5:30 in the morning, KRON4 reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/san-fran-reparations-stalling-due-money-legal-issues-experts-grill-city-apology-not-enough&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SAN FRAN REPARATIONS EFFORT STALLING DUE TO MONEY, LEGAL ISSUES, EXPERTS GRILL CITY FOR APOLOGY: ‘NOT ENOUGH&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;After breaking the glass on the front door, a security video shows a man coming inside the store and helping himself to a wide array of goods,&quot; the outlet reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Being a small business in Oakland and how tough things have already been for us, for small businesses in general, it doesn&apos;t feel good. It doesn&apos;t feel good at all,&quot; Jay said. &quot;It&apos;s really devastating, it&apos;s really heartbreaking. It&apos;s very discouraging.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The robber reportedly stole iPads, phones, clothing and thousands of dollars in goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He even used our suitcases and packed our inventory in the suitcases,&quot; Jay said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I feel like this [affects] all of our businesses,&quot; the business owner added. &quot;Your business is my business, my business is yours, and we should be in it in the right way. We have to support one another to be here and we have to speak about it vocally.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bay-area-city-install-480-surveillance-cameras-anti-crime-bid-newsom-announces&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BAY AREA CITY TO INSTALL 480 SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS IN ANTI-CRIME BID, NEWSOM ANNOUNCES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing group of business owners in the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/fox-news-california&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bay Area&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are declaring that they no longer want to pay taxes after a slew of robberies and thefts made them feel like the city wasn&apos;t doing enough to protect them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses in Oakland, California, have faced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;thefts and attacks&lt;/a&gt; in recent months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re scared for our lives,&quot; Cybelle&apos;s Pizza manager Nestor Sanchez said, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ktvu.com/news/oakland-business-owners-frustrated-with-crime-and-may-not-pay-taxes-in-protest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;KTVU report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Now, Dimond District is not the same as the years I had been working.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oakland Police Department and the City of Oakland did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>James Patterson&apos;s new true crime series to spotlight three riveting unsolved murder mysteries</title>
                    
                    <description>Lauren Petterson, president of Fox Nation, announced the debut of a new three-part true crime series hosted by acclaimed author James Patterson on Monday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new true crime series made its &lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox Nation debut&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, with the goal to immerse viewers in three riveting unsolved investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;multi-part series &lt;/a&gt;will explore three homicide cases, pulling in interviews from those closest to the incidents – ranging from friends and family to crime experts – to give subscribers a well-rounded scope of each investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was totally gripped by these cases. The fact that they are real-life stories – and that we may help bring justice to the victims and their families – is very special,&quot; said Lauren Petterson, president of Fox Nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/sean-larkins-crime-cam-24-7-renews-second-season-putting-citizens-heart-crime-fighting&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEAN LARKIN&apos;S ‘CRIME CAM 24/7’ RENEWS FOR SECOND SEASON, PUTTING CITIZENS AT THE HEART OF CRIME-FIGHTING&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Petterson announced &quot;Unsolved with James Patterson&apos;s&quot; debut on Monday, noting that critically acclaimed author and crime expert James Patterson will host the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterson holds a long list of feats. He was named the bestselling author of all-time by &lt;i&gt;Publisher’s Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, published over 260 New York Times bestsellers, created the acclaimed &quot;Alex Cross&quot; series, among other popular and upcoming projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has also published a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;non-fiction bestsellers&lt;/a&gt; about famous personalities and first responders. He received the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox Nation &quot;Back the Blue Award&quot;&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 for his work supporting law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In announcing the new Fox Nation series on Monday, Petterson said, &quot;For decades, James Patterson has captivated the country with his bestselling titles, and we are thrilled to bring his incredible talents in storytelling and suspense to Fox Nation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-angers-law-enforcement-skipping-nypd-officers-wake-favor-fundraiser-adjust-schedule&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN ANGERS LAW ENFORCEMENT BY SKIPPING NYPD OFFICER&apos;S WAKE IN FAVOR OF FUNDRAISER: ‘ADJUST YOUR SCHEDULE’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unsolved with James Patterson&quot; will lead off with a deep dive into the case of Nanette Krentel, a Louisiana pre-school teacher and wife of the local fire chief whose apparent unease about something unclear seemed warranted when her home went up in flames and her body was recovered among the ashes with a gunshot wound to the head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Episode two breaks down the case of Elizabeth Salgado of Utah, who recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/location-mexico&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;moved from Mexico &lt;/a&gt;to join the Mormon Church. Weeks after the change, she disappeared, only to be found in a canyon years later. Testimonies from her family could help shed some light on what happened exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/ultimate-evil-ultimate-innocence-mind-idaho-murder-suspect-bryan-kohberger&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;‘ULTIMATE EVIL MEETING ULTIMATE INNOCENCE:’ INSIDE THE MIND OF IDAHO MURDER SUSPECT BRYAN KOHBERGER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final episode explores the unsolved case of Brian Egg, a San Franciscan known to open his home to people in need. He went missing after several strange occurrences, and his dismembered body was later found inside his home in a fish tank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about these cases, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;subscribe to Fox Nation&lt;/a&gt; and begin streaming &quot;Unsolved with James Patterson.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SUBSCRIBE TO FOX NATION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Rare human case of highly contagious bird flu confirmed in Texas</title>
                    
                    <description>The CDC announced Monday that a person in Texas has tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, otherwise known as H5N1 bird flu.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Monday that a person in Texas has tested positive for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;highly pathogenic avian influenza,&lt;/a&gt; otherwise known as H5N1 bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This person had exposure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;dairy cattle in Texas&lt;/a&gt; presumed to be infected with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses. The patient reported eye redness (consistent with conjunctivitis), as their only symptom, and is recovering,&quot; the CDC said in a statement. &quot;The patient was told to isolate and is being treated with an antiviral drug for flu.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC said this is the second case of a human testing positive for H5N1 in the United States, after a previous case was observed in Colorado in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This infection does not change the H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which CDC considers to be low,&quot; it added. &quot;However, people with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/us-tuberculosis-cases-2023-highest-level-decade-cdc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US TUBERCULOSIS CASES IN 2023 WERE AT HIGHEST LEVEL IN A DECADE, CDC SAYS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were reported to be infected with bird flu – and federal agriculture officials later confirmed infections in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Michigan dairy herd&lt;/a&gt; that had recently received cows from Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bird flu was first identified as a threat to people during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong, according to the Associated Press. More than 460 people have died in the past two decades from bird flu infections, the World Health Organization says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/puerto-rico-health-officials-declare-dengue-fever-public-health-emergency-more-than-500-cases-reported&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PUERTO RICO HEALTH OFFICIALS DECLARE DENGUE FEVER A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas officials did not identify the newly infected person, nor release any details about what brought them in contact with the cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC said it is &quot;working with state health departments to continue to monitor workers who may have been in contact with infected or potentially infected birds/animals and test those people who develop symptoms.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Human illnesses with H5N1 bird flu have ranged from mild (e.g., eye infection, upper respiratory symptoms) to severe illness (e.g., pneumonia) that have resulted in death in other countries,&quot; the CDC also said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>White House calls squatting a &apos;local issue&apos; that governments must address</title>
                    
                    <description>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday said local governments must address the issue of squatters seizing the property of homeowners.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The White House is calling the squatting trend in which strangers seize and live in a homeowner&apos;s property against their wishes a &quot;local issue&quot; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;local governments&lt;/a&gt; must address themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday whether Americans need to be worried about squatters and where President Biden stands on the issue as horror stories continue to make headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My understanding is that this is obviously a local issue,&quot; Jean-Pierre said. &quot;We are certainly tracking that issue. The rights of property owners and renters must be protected.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And we believe that ultimately what needs to happen is that the local government needs to make sure that they address this, and they take action,&quot; the press secretary continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/squatter-scam-ends-florida-desantis-sheriff-tout-new-crackdown-straight-jail&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘SQUATTER SCAM’ ENDS IN FLORIDA AS DESANTIS, SHERIFF TOUT NEW CRACKDOWN: ‘STRAIGHT TO JAIL’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jean-Pierre said all Americans in communities across the country want the same thing: &quot;They want their families to be safe and that’s what we want as well.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked whether Biden would support a law like one taking effect in Florida that allows homeowners to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;call police&lt;/a&gt; on squatters, Jean-Pierre said she would not address hypotheticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What I can say is that this is ultimately a local issue, and it’s critical that local governments address this,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/anti-squatting-professional-celebrates-florida-ban-other-state-laws-frustrate-homeowners&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANTI-SQUATTING ‘PROFESSIONAL&apos; CELEBRATES FLORIDA BAN AS OTHER STATE LAWS FRUSTRATE HOMEOWNERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ron-desantis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis&lt;/a&gt; signed a bill last week that granted state law enforcement officials the power to remove offenders and increase penalties for squatters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes as property owners nationwide complain about their homes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/squatters-sue-good-samaritan-trash-property-he-allowed-temporary-free-stays&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;being seized by strangers&lt;/a&gt; and the limited options to take back what is rightfully theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Florida law is set to go into effect on July 1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Rankin County, Mississippi Sheriff&amp;apos;s deputies fatally shot a man who fired a gun in their direction Sunday afternoon, according to the state Department of Public Safety.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sheriff&apos;s deputies in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/mississippi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;central Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; shot and killed a man who fired a gun toward them, the state Department of Public Safety said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/louisiana-man-arrested-charged-deadly-mississippi-bus-shooting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOUISIANA MAN ARRESTED, CHARGED IN DEADLY MISSISSIPPI BUS SHOOTING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shooting happened around 4 p.m. Sunday in the Rankin County town of Florence. Deputies with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rankin County Sheriff’s Office&lt;/a&gt; were responding to a call about a person threatening family members at a home, according to a Department of Public Safety news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When deputies arrived, the man fired his weapon at the deputies, who returned fire. The man was taken to a hospital and was pronounced dead, the news release said. The deputies involved were not injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is examining the case, as it does with most shootings by or of law enforcement officers. Following its investigation, the Bureau will share its findings with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;state Attorney General’s Office&lt;/a&gt;, which can choose to pursue further action if legal violations are uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Argentina and Colombia have agreed to end a diplomatic spat between their respective presidents: Javier Milei, a libertarian, and Gustavo Petro, a leftist.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/regions/south-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Argentina and Colombia&lt;/a&gt; have agreed to end a diplomatic spat that escalated over right-wing Argentine President Javier Milei’s visceral attack on his leftist counterpart in Colombia last week, prompting the country to order the expulsion of Argentine diplomats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement late Sunday, the foreign ministries of the two Latin American nations said they &quot;have taken concrete steps to overcome any differences and strengthen this relationship.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia said its ambassador that it had summoned from Buenos Aires would return there, and the Argentine government said its foreign minister would visit Bogotá. Colombia also stepped back from its threat to expel Argentine diplomats, saying it would approve Argentina’s newly appointed ambassador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/colombias-largest-criminal-group-accepts-presidents-offer-broker-peace-deal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLOMBIA&apos;S LARGEST CRIMINAL GROUP ACCEPTS PRESIDENT&apos;S OFFER TO BROKER PEACE DEAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions between Argentina&apos;s Milei and Colombian President Gustavo Petro have repeatedly erupted into bitter quarrels since Milei, a brash right-wing economist and former TV personality, burst onto the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-politics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;world stage&lt;/a&gt; last year. Past sharp exchanges include Milei calling Petro &quot;a murderous communist,&quot; and describing socialists as &quot;human excrement.&quot; Petro retorted that &quot;this is what Hitler said.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, the contentious war of words between the populist presidents began with Milei branding Petro a &quot;terrorist murderer&quot; in an interview last week with CNN, a reference to Petro&apos;s past as a member of a left-wing guerrilla group. In response, Petro accused Milei on social media of isolating Argentina diplomatically and increasing its poverty rate with his libertarian policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milei and Petro come from opposite political poles. Petro won the presidency with pledges to create social programs to aid Colombia’s long-neglected poor, while Milei — a self-described anarcho-capitalist — promised to slash government spending while eliminating ministries and costly programs as a means to rein in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy/inflation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;triple-digit inflation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet both leaders rocketed to power with promises of radical change stemming from voters’ frustration with establishments that they say long have failed to address deep-rooted poverty and inequality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Combs has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/kids&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;six older children&lt;/a&gt;, none of whom were featured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diddy had previously been lying low after several of his properties were raided last Monday, resurfacing at his Miami mansion days later. On Easter, he was photographed on his property engaged in a phone call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-lawsuit-names-50-cents-ex-girlfriend-one-music-moguls-alleged-sex-workers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEAN &apos;DIDDY&apos; COMBS LAWSUIT NAMES 50 CENT&apos;S EX-GIRLFRIEND AS ONE OF MUSIC MOGUL&apos;S ALLEGED SEX WORKERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C5MeEg2vbRM/?img_index=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APP USERS CLICK HERE TO VIEW INSTAGRAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the raids, a U.S. official confirmed to Fox News that they were connected to a federal human trafficking investigation, although it&apos;s unclear if Diddy is the target of the federal agents&apos; investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Diddy&apos;s attorney issued a statement denouncing the raid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yesterday, there was a gross overuse of military-level force as search warrants were executed at Mr. Combs’ residences. There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated. Mr. Combs was never detained but spoke to and cooperated with authorities. Despite media speculation, neither Mr. Combs nor any of his family members have been arrested nor has their ability to travel been restricted in any way,&quot; Aaron Dyer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This unprecedented ambush — paired with an advanced, coordinated media presence — leads to a premature rush to judgment of Mr. Combs and is nothing more than a witch hunt based on meritless accusations made in civil lawsuits. There has been no finding of criminal or civil liability with any of these allegations. Mr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combs, 54, is also the subject of a lawsuit filed by &quot;Lil Rod&quot; Jones Jr., a producer on Combs&apos; latest studio album, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/music&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Love Album: Off the Grid.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Jones Jr. filed a lawsuit in February accusing the rapper of sexually assaulting him and forcing him to perform sex acts with prostitutes, in documents obtained by Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the filing, Combs&apos; lawyer disputed Jones Jr.&apos;s claims, calling them &quot;pure fiction.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The video he shared on social media has quickly spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hello, uh, you ordered groceries?&quot; a female officer can be seen asking in doorbell camera footage shared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/florida-police-officer-delivers-grocery-order-following-arrest-of-fugitive-delivery-driver&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;FOX 35 Orlando.&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Yes,&quot; the woman who answered the door said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Your driver got arrested, so we&apos;re delivering your groceries,&quot; the officer responded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/bodycam-video-shows-nypd-officers-spring-action-pull-man-subway-tracks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BODYCAM VIDEO SHOWS NYPD OFFICERS SPRING INTO ACTION TO PULL MAN FROM SUBWAY TRACKS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The female officer was then joined by a male officer, who walked bag after bag into the house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My dad was a police officer when I was growing up, so I have the utmost respect for them, so when I saw that, it was wonderful to see,&quot; Neu said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Titusville police arrested suspect Richard Robertson, 40, who was wanted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;felony charges&lt;/a&gt; in Texas and Florida, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by FOX 35. He was pulled over after officers spotted his car, and was arrested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/george-mason-university-police-sergeant-arrests-doordash-driver-makes-delivery-himself&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY POLICE SERGEANT ARRESTS DOORDASH DRIVER, MAKES THE DELIVERY HIMSELF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robertson&apos;s total bond amount was set at $26,000, according to online arrest records. His next court date is set for May 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Titusville Police were successful in the arrest of a wanted felon off the city streets,&quot; a statement to FOX 35 read. &quot;However, we remain compassionate and appreciative of our citizens, and we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/good-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;happy to complete the delivery&lt;/a&gt; of paid groceries to a valued community member.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;It is unknown which delivery platform Robertson was working for at the time of his arrest. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Titusville police&lt;/a&gt; did not immediately respond to a Fox News request for more information.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Russian-American journalist to remain in custody for 2 more months following court order</title>
                    
                    <description>Alsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist, has been ordered to remain in custody for another two months pending her investigation and trial after being arrested on Oct. 18.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A court in Russia on Monday ordered a detained Russian-American journalist to be held in jail for two more months pending investigation and trial, in a further step in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Kremlin’s crackdown&lt;/a&gt; on dissent and free speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alsu Kurmasheva, an editor for the U.S. government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Tatar-Bashkir service, was taken into custody on Oct. 18 and charged with failing to register as a foreign agent while collecting information about the Russian military. Later, she was also charged with spreading &quot;false information&quot; about the Russian military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;court in Tatarstan&lt;/a&gt; on Monday ordered her to remain behind bars at least until June 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/second-american-journalist-detained-russia-this-year-evan-gershkovich&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SECOND AMERICAN JOURNALIST DETAINED IN RUSSIA THIS YEAR AFTER EVAN GERSHKOVICH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurmasheva, who holds U.S. and Russian citizenship and lives in Prague with her husband and two daughters, could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted, according to RFE/RL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told reporters in the courtroom on Monday that she wasn&apos;t doing &quot;very well physically&quot; and that some of her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;medical conditions&lt;/a&gt; have flared up in detention. &quot;Living conditions are very bad, I have no way of taking care of my health,&quot; she said, adding that medical assistance in the detention center was &quot;minimal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian authorities have intensified a crackdown on Kremlin critics and independent journalists after President Vladimir Putin sent troops to Ukraine in February 2022, using legislation that effectively criminalized any public expression about the conflict that deviates from the Kremlin line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurmasheva was the second U.S. journalist detained in Russia last year, after Wall Street Journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-says-he-working-secure-release-evan-gershkovich-1-year-anniversary-detention-russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;reporter Evan Gershkovich&lt;/a&gt; was arrested on espionage charges in March. Gershkovich and his employer have rejected the charges, and the U.S. authorities designated him wrongfully detained. He has spent a year in custody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurmasheva was initially stopped on June 2 at Kazan International Airport after traveling to Russia the previous month to visit her ailing elderly mother. Officials confiscated her U.S. and Russian passports and fined her for failing to register her U.S. passport. She was waiting for her passports to be returned when she was arrested on new charges in October. RFE/RL has called for her release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFE/RL was told by Russian authorities in 2017 to register as a foreign agent, but it has challenged Moscow’s use of foreign agent laws in the European Court of Human Rights. The organization has been fined millions of dollars by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Three other men, two aged 25 and a 21, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;wounded in the shooting.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two suspects had pulled their vehicle up to the group on the sidewalk, exited and opened fire, according to police. The suspects then fled the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;No arrests&lt;/a&gt; have been made in connection to these shootings as police continue to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Biden administration tightens rules on African elephant imports, stops short of total ban</title>
                    
                    <description>The Biden administration is implementing new restrictions on the trade of elephant trophies, but declined to issue an outright ban, sparking rebuke from some advocates.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration strengthened&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/100-elephants-die-africas-largest-national-parks-drought&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; protections for African elephants&lt;/a&gt;, but stopped short of issuing a total ban on imports of hunting trophies and live animals, to the disappointment of wildlife activists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an announcement late last week, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-quietly-consulted-left-wing-eco-groups-plan-block-millions-acres-montana-ag&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service &lt;/a&gt;finalized restrictions on elephants imported to the U.S. under the Endangered Species Act, which it said would aid the long-term conservation and survival of elephants in the wild. Prominent wildlife activist organizations have called for the agency to go further and ban such imports altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Service values collaborative conservation of wildlife all around the world and is committed to improving implementation of international conservation law,&quot; FWS Director Martha Williams said. &quot;Our actions today will help support range countries’ efforts to manage and conserve African elephant populations and will further protect African elephants that are imported to the United States.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that FWS would continue to work with African nations to ensure the sustainable management of elephant populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/endangered-species-gray-wolves-threaten-farms-ranches-gop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS GRAY WOLVES TERRORIZE FARMS AND RANCHES, GOP LAWMAKERS DEMAND ENDANGERED SPECIES DELISTING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the finalized regulations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/many-zoos-us-phasing-out-elephants-others-embark-breeding-projects&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;live African elephants&lt;/a&gt;, African elephant sport hunting trophies (such as tusks, hides, feet and tails), and African elephant parts and products may be imported into the U.S., but only from countries that have laws in place to ensure conservation of the species. The regulations also require imports to go to American facilities that are able to properly care for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rulemaking further highlights the administration&apos;s view that, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-takes-aim-hunters-latest-regulation-preventing-americans-from-hunting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;hunting to achieve its conservation&lt;/a&gt; potential, it must be &quot;well-regulated&quot; and include accountability measures, FWS said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, advocates expressed disappointment at FWS&apos; decision to stop short of a full ban on imports and vowed to keep pushing for such a policy at the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-accelerates-plan-to-unleash-apex-predator-near-rural-community-over-widespread-local-opposition&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BIDEN ADMIN ACCELERATES PLAN TO UNLEASH GRIZZLY BEARS NEAR RURAL COMMUNITY OVER WIDESPREAD LOCAL OPPOSITION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m truly crushed this rule doesn’t ban trade in elephant hunting trophies to the United States, and it doesn’t even require stable elephant populations to allow trophy imports,&quot; said Tanya Sanerib, international legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity. &quot;These magnificent animals are globally cherished but under threat, and it&apos;s high time we stop letting wealthy trophy hunters turn them into decor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanerib said the restrictions finalized by the administration are &quot;mouse-sized&quot; and treat elephants like commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Flocken, the president of Humane Society International, applauded the new restrictions, but similarly called for even stronger measures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will continue to fight for a full ban on the trade in African elephant hunting trophies, and we hope this sets a precedent that can be applied to other countries and to other imperiled species, like lions, giraffes and leopards,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulations, which will take effect on May 1, 2024, were first proposed in November 2022. After they were proposed, FWS received thousands of comments from stakeholders, a large majority of whom called for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/endangered-species&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;increased conservation of African elephants&lt;/a&gt;, according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groups like the Performing Animal Welfare Society, Friends of Animals and the Animal Welfare Institute used their comments to call for the Biden administration to use the rulemaking to issue a complete ban on elephant imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Friends of Animals urges FWS to prohibit the import of live African elephants. There is no reason to continue to allow these intelligent and social creatures to suffer in captivity,&quot; Stephen Hernick, a senior attorney at the Wildlife Law Program for Friends of Animals, wrote in the group&apos;s comments last year.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Critics slam Scotland’s new hate speech law as an attack on freedom</title>
                    
                    <description>A new Scottish law making it a criminal offense to spread hate speech against protected groups online or elsewhere went into force just in time for April Fools&amp;apos; Day.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Scotland’s controversial new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/first-amendment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;hate speech law&lt;/a&gt; went into effect Monday despite fierce backlash from critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Scotland continues to infringe upon the right of her citizens to speak freely. This bill will force police to investigate those who ‘misgender’ someone online,&quot; Thomas Corbett-Dillon, a former adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, told Fox News Digital. &quot;In a country riddled by knife crime, and with one of the lowest life expectancies in Europe, you would think the Scottish Government has more important things to focus on, but no, they are desperate to pander to an extremely small group of men in dresses who feel offended when they are not referred to as women.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments come &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;as Scotland&lt;/a&gt; officially announced that its hate crime law aimed at providing &quot;greater protection for victims and communities&quot; came into force Monday, creating new criminal offenses for those who use &quot;threatening or abusive&quot; behavior intended to &quot;stir up hatred based on prejudice toward characteristics including age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity and variations in sex characteristics,&quot; according to a press release by the Scottish government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new law warns that people can be prosecuted for sharing offensive rhetoric across multiple media platforms, which includes &quot;displaying, publishing or distributing the material e.g. on a sign; on the internet through websites, blogs, podcasts, social media etc., either directly, or by forwarding or repeating material that originates from a third party; through printed media such as magazine publications or leaflets, etc. Giving, sending, showing or playing the material to another person e.g. through online streaming, by email, playing a video, through public performance of a play, etc.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/scotland-launch-new-hate-speech-law-april-fools-day-jail-people-7-years&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCOTLAND TO LAUNCH NEW HATE SPEECH LAW ON APRIL FOOL’S DAY THAT WILL JAIL PEOPLE FOR UP TO 7 YEARS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;People convicted&lt;/a&gt; of running afoul of the new laws could face fines and even a prison sentence of up to seven years, with proponents arguing the legislation will send &quot;a strong and clear message to victims, perpetrators, communities and to wider society that offences motivated by prejudice will be treated seriously and will not be tolerated.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the legislation has also been widely panned by critics, with renowned author J.K. Rowling describing the law as &quot;ludicrous&quot; in social media posts last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you genuinely imagine I’d delete posts calling a man a man, so as not to be prosecuted under this ludicrous law, stand by for the mother of all April Fools’ jokes,&quot; Rowling, a frequent critic of transgender ideology, said on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corbett-Dillon pointed to Rowling, noting that the Harry Potter author could be one of those targeted under the new legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bbc-disciplines-top-radio-host-calling-trans-women-male-during-radio-show&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BBC DISCIPLINES TOP RADIO HOST FOR CALLING TRANS WOMEN MALE DURING RADIO SHOW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This law could lead to renowned Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling being arrested because she refuses to call trans people ‘She’ online. This new law does nothing to protect women, or to stop men from entering into female sports competitions, or men entering into women’s bathrooms,&quot; Corbet-Dillon said. &quot;Trans people have become a ‘protected community’ in Scotland, but women remain unprotected.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Scottish government has defended the law, with Minister for Victims and Community Safety Siobhian Brown arguing that the country is &quot;building safer communities that live free from hatred and prejudice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We know that the impact on those on the receiving end of physical, verbal or online attacks can be traumatic and life-changing. This legislation is an essential element of our wider approach to tackling that harm,&quot; Brown said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown also argued that there were protections for free speech built into the legislation, noting the new offenses would have a &quot;higher threshold for criminality&quot; than old laws that have been in place since 1986.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But critics have still questioned those protections, with Faculty of Advocates’ Criminal Bar Association President Tony Lenehan worrying that the law could target journalists, comedians, debaters and dramatists, in comments to BBC last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those claims were pushed back on by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Scotland’s national police&lt;/a&gt;, who denied that the agency would proactively &quot;target actors, comedians, or any other people or groups.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Corbet-Dillon argued that the Scottish government should instead focus its attention on protecting free speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The trans community continue to destroy women’s rights in their desperate pursuit to receive affirmation of their gender delusions,&quot; Corbet-Dillon said. &quot;Scotland, and England, both urgently need to enshrine freedom of speech into their laws.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Denver city official appeared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/denver-becoming-overwhelmed-40000-spike-migrant-population&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;beg migrants&lt;/a&gt; to leave the sanctuary city that&apos;s been burdened with illegal immigrants in a leaked viral video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/next/next-with-kyle-clark/denver-warns-newly-arrived-migrants-to-leave/73-9f475e63-47cd-4315-bd54-e2d4aa4e6adc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;obtained by 9NEWS&lt;/a&gt;, city official Andres Carrera, Denver&apos;s Newcomer Communications Liaison, tells a group of migrants that the city&apos;s shelters can no longer help them, and they must go to other sanctuary cities or they &quot;will suffer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The opportunities are over,&quot; Carrera reportedly tells the group in Spanish. &quot;New York gives you more. Chicago gives you more. So I suggest you go there where there is longer-term shelter. There are also more job opportunities there.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are not going to block you if you want to say here,&quot; he continues. &quot;If you stay here you are going to suffer even more and I don’t want to see this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/denver-pleads-property-owners-rent-migrant-newcomers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DENVER PLEADS WITH PROPERTY OWNERS TO RENT TO MIGRANT ‘NEWCOMERS’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the city official suggested New York, Chicago or Miami as destinations with more resources, he offered to transport them to any city they wished in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You don’t have to walk anywhere, we can buy you a free ticket,&quot; Carrera added. &quot;You can go to any city. We can take you up to the Canadian border, wherever!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A city spokesperson told 9News that they will not bus migrants to Canada but can take them to cities near the Canadian border if they desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his speech, Carrerra asked the migrants to raise their hand if they wanted to leave Denver and go to another city where there is more work. The video appeared to show a handful of people raising their hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/denver-mayor-pleads-nationally-coordinated-effort-migrant-crisis-city-nears-breaking-point&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DENVER MAYOR PLEADS FOR NATIONALLY COORDINATED EFFORT ON MIGRANT CRISIS AS CITY NEARS ‘BREAKING POINT’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who wants to stay in Denver?&quot; he then asked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Todos,&quot; or &quot;everyone,&quot; one migrant replies, as several people are shown raising their hands in the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sanctuary city has been struggling to stretch its limited resources to support the growing number of migrants in the city. Texas has transported thousands of migrants to sanctuary cities like Denver, to showcase the problems border states face when migrants flood their cities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the city argued the video did not show a complete picture of the efforts Denver has made to help migrants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This news clip showed such a small part of the work our team member did that evening, and just a fraction of the tireless amount of work he and the rest of the city’s team have put in to help newcomers who arrive in Denver,&quot; the spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our city has received more than 40,000 newcomers, or 5.6% of our population, which is the most per capita of any city in the country. We’re proud of the support we’ve been able to offer so far, but without federal support, Denver does not have the resources or capacity to maintain this outsized share of the load.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Given the number of people who have arrived in Denver, there are very few opportunities for work and housing, and those opportunities only continue to shrink. Encouraging onward travel to destinations where newcomers may have support networks or better opportunities will continue to be a critical part of our long-term strategy to ensure the greatest opportunity for success for both newcomers and the City of Denver,&quot; the statement continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston announced the city would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/denver-scales-back-migrant-services-closing-four-shelters-effort-reduce-budget-save-millions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;closing four migrant shelters&lt;/a&gt; to cut costs incurred by the border crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City leaders also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/denver-pleads-property-owners-rent-migrant-newcomers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;asked locals&lt;/a&gt; to rent their homes to illegal immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnston, like Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and New York City Mayor Eric Adams, has pleaded for more federal aid to help their cities deal with the overwhelming number of migrants &quot;crushing&quot; the city&apos;s budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Alba Cuebas-Fantauzzi contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Pro-Palestinian protesters released after disrupting Easter Mass in NYC</title>
                    
                    <description>Three pro-Palestinian protesters are facing charges after being arrested for disrupting an Easter weekend Mass at St. Patrick&amp;apos;s Cathedral in New York City.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A trio of pro-Palestinian protesters was released without bail in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; after being arrested for disrupting an Easter Vigil Mass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral by unfurling a banner and shouting, &quot;Free Palestine!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Police Department told Fox News Digital that Gregory Schwedock, 35, John Rozendaal, 63, of New York, and Matthew Menzies, 31, of Colchester, each have been charged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;disruption of a religious service&lt;/a&gt; following the incident caught on video Saturday night. Court records Monday indicate that all three men have since been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Three male individuals barged entered the church and disrupted Mass by approaching the altar while yelling ‘Free Palestine,’&quot; the NYPD said in a statement. &quot;The individuals were taken into custody at the scene without incident.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video taken at the scene shows a banner with the message &quot;Silence = Death&quot; being unfurled near the altar of the Easter Vigil service, which was led by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York. Security quickly removed the protesters from the area and many in attendance did not appear to acknowledge the outburst. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/pro-palestinian-protesters-interrupt-easter-vigil-service-st-patricks-cathedral-nyc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS INTERRUPT EASTER VIGIL SERVICE AT ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL IN NYC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The climate activist group behind the stunt, Extinction Rebellion, wrote on X that their activists &quot;demand all faith leaders take immediate and vocal action against genocide and ecocide.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;War, occupation, and industrial pollution are poisoning the soil, air and water in Gaza and all over the planet, destroying the earth’s capacity to sustain life,&quot; it continued. &quot;This destruction is called ‘Ecocide.’&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;With thirty thousand dead in Gaza and all life on earth threatened by the climate crisis, every individual and every institution that values justice, peace, and love has a duty to oppose genocide and ecocide in a way that can be clearly seen and heard by all,&quot; it also said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/pro-palestinian-protesters-disrupt-berkeley-city-council-meeting-holocaust-remembrance-vote-end-israel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS DISRUPT BERKELEY CITY COUNCIL MEETING, HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE VOTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops had issued a call for prayer for peace in the Middle East and an end to the Israel-Hamas war in a statement before the start of Holy Week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Patrick’s Cathedral did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwedock, who was one of the protesters arrested, was previously taken into custody last September &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/end-fossil-fuels-protesters-disrupt-us-open-semifinal-match-demonstrator-glues-shoes-ground&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;after disrupting a U.S. Open tennis&lt;/a&gt; semifinal match during which climate activists used glue to prevent security from ejecting them, according to the New York Post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Stepheny Price contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Beach bands in Mexico are allowed to continue playing music after complaints threatened to end the noise</title>
                    
                    <description>Wandering beach bands playing near tourist hot spots in Mexico emerge victorious following dismissed noise complaints from foreign tourists in Mazaltan.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bands who play the thumping tuba-and-drums songs of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/location-mexico&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;northern Mexico&lt;/a&gt; on beaches in the resort city of Mazatlan appear to have emerged victorious this week after noise complaints had threatened to silence them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But anybody who planned to witness the April 8 eclipse in a moment of awed silence will likely be disappointed. Mazatlan, on the Pacific coast, will be first place in North America where the path of totality will be visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of complaints &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;from foreign tourists&lt;/a&gt; who like to observe the resort&apos;s sunsets in peace — or with a bit of soft music — a local hotel owner had suggested limiting the time or places where the bands could play. The bands usually wander the beaches, asking for a few dollars per song to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-warning-mexico-spring-break-travel-top-threats-facing-americans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US WARNING ON MEXICO SPRING BREAK TRAVEL, TOP THREATS FACING AMERICANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their music is hardly conducive to reflection or relaxation — think of a frantic, speed-fueled polka with lots and lots of brass and snare drums, earning the bands the nickname of tamboras, or drums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after a protest march by the musicians turned into a violent scuffle with police last week, efforts to limit them appear to have been abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The people are very conscious now, and they are defending their rights,&quot; President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Monday. &quot;This is how they make a living, and besides, this is a long-standing tradition ... and for that reason they protested and managed to get it reversed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What isn&apos;t good is the violence,&quot; López Obrador said. &quot;But the Sinaloa bands, or the musicians of the Sinaloa bands, are completely within their rights to protest, just no violence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there never appears to have been any city-wide ban, at least one hotel had put up signs prohibiting the bands from offering their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/beach&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;services to beachgoers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos of the scuffles between musicians and police went viral last week, with some band members hitting police with drum sticks. Drums were turned into weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubén Rocha, the governor of the northern state of Sinaloa, where Mazatlan is located, wrote in his social media accounts Thursday that &quot;I do not share the idea of prohibiting the musicians of Mazatlan from carrying out their honest dignified work, that allows them to feed their families.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue came to a head when local hotel operator Ernesto Coppel posted a video urging that the bands be limited as to when or where they could offer to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They are a disaster on the beaches of Mazatlan. They don&apos;t allow people to rest,&quot; Coppel said. &quot;I have a lot of complaints from hundreds of American tourists who say to me ‘I won’t return to Mazatlan because of the noise.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideas apparently included designating certain spaces on the beach for musicians, rather than having them wandering up and down the sand, playing to people in beach chairs in front of hotels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinaloa, which is home to the drug cartel of the same name, is not exactly known for restraint. An unusually high number of exotic animals like lions and tigers have been seized there, ornate mansion are the norm, and the main tourist attraction in the state capital is a graveyard featuring the lavish tombs of drug traffickers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cameron Sutton, a former Detroit Lions cornerback who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lions-cameron-sutton-wanted-domestic-violence-charge-florida&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;was wanted by police&lt;/a&gt; in Florida last month for a domestic violence warrant, turned himself in on Sunday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office&lt;/a&gt; released a video showing Sutton, 29, arriving at a jail in Tampa. Sutton was wanted for domestic battery by strangulation, which is a third-degree felony and could result in a prison term of up to five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;After weeks of evading law enforcement, this man has finally made the right choice to turn himself in,&quot; Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said. &quot;Domestic violence has no place in our community, and no one is above the law here in Hillsborough County. My thoughts are with this woman as she continues to heal from this man’s gruesome actions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lions released Sutton after police announced he was being sought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities said officers responded to a call about domestic violence in progress involving the former Pittsburgh Steelers player and a female around 5 a.m. on March 7. The sheriff’s office then asked the public for help trying to find Sutton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lions president Rod Wood said at the time that Sutton was at the team’s training facility when the warrant was issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/police-seek-chiefs-rashee-rice-connection-major-crash-dallas-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POLICE SEEK CHIEFS&apos; RASHEE RICE IN CONNECTION WITH &apos;MAJOR&apos; CRASH IN DALLAS: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We learned about the warrant at the same time everybody else did on social media,&quot; Wood told Fox 2 Detroit last week. &quot;We were able to speak to Cam because he was actually in our building. We found him. He was down with our strength staff. He kind of showed up unexpectedly to work out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sutton signed a three-year, $30 million deal with the Lions before the start of the 2023 season after spending six years with the Steelers. He played and started all 17 games for Detroit and their three playoff games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had a career-high 65 tackles and an interception in 2023. He was projected to be a starting cornerback going into the 2024 season along with newly signed Carlton Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Pittsburgh selected&lt;/a&gt; the Jonesboro, Georgia, native in the third round of the 2017 draft out of Tennessee. He earned his way to being a starting cornerback in his fifth season with Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Steelers, he had 168 total tackles in 84 career games along with eight interceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Strange cicada facts to know before they emerge this spring: Zombie STD, strongest stream in animal kingdom</title>
                    
                    <description>Cicadas are about to emerge in numbers unseen for decades, but that is not the only strange thing about them. For instance, cicadas urinate stronger and faster than elephants.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The periodical &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/rare-broods-cicadas-arrive-soon-when-expect-them-what-means-you&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;cicadas that are about to infest&lt;/a&gt; two parts of the United States aren&apos;t just plentiful, they&apos;re downright weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insects are the strongest urinators in the animal kingdom with flows that put humans and elephants to shame. They have pumps in their heads that pull moisture from the roots of trees, allowing them to feed for more than a decade underground. They are rescuers of caterpillars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they are being ravaged by a sexually transmitted disease that turns them into zombies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/rare-simultaneous-explosion-cicadas-expected-first-time-221-years&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RARE &apos;SIMULTANEOUS EXPLOSION&apos; OF CICADAS EXPECTED FOR FIRST TIME IN 221 YEARS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside trees are sugary, nutrient-heavy saps that flow through tissue called phloem. Most insects love the sap. But not cicadas — they go for tissue called xylem, which carries mostly water and a bit of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it&apos;s not easy to get into the xylem, which doesn&apos;t just flow out when a bug taps into it because it&apos;s under negative pressure. The cicada can get the fluid because its outsized head has a pump, said University of Alabama Huntsville entomologist Carrie Deans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They use their proboscis like a tiny straw — about the width of a hair — with the pump sucking out the liquid, said Georgia Tech biophysics professor Saad Bhamla. They spend nearly their entire lives drinking, year after year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s a hard way to make a living,&quot; Deans said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that watery fluid has to come out the other end. And boy does it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhamla in March published a study of the urination flow rates of animals across the world. Cicadas were clearly king, peeing two to three times stronger and faster than elephants and humans. He couldn&apos;t look at the periodical cicadas that mostly feed and pee underground, but he used video to record and measure the flow rate of their Amazon cousins, which topped out around 10 feet per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have a muscle that pushes the waste through a tiny hole like a jet, Bhamla said. He said he learned this when in the Amazon he happened on a tree the locals called a &quot;weeping tree&quot; because liquid was flowing down, like the plant was crying. It was cicada pee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You walk around in a forest where they&apos;re actively chorusing on a hot sunny day. It feels like it&apos;s raining,&quot; said University of Connecticut entomologist John Cooley. That&apos;s their honeydew or waste product coming out the back end ... It&apos;s called cicada rain.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years and areas where cicadas come out, caterpillars enjoy a cicada reprieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Maryland entomologist Dan Gruner studied caterpillars after the 2021 cicada emergence in the mid-Atlantic. He found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/insects&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the bugs&lt;/a&gt; that turn into moths survived the spring in bigger numbers because the birds that usually eat them were too busy getting cicadas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Periodical cicadas are &quot;lazy, fat and slow,&quot; Gruner said. &quot;They&apos;re extraordinarily easy to capture for us and for their predators.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s a deadly sexually transmitted disease, a fungus, that turns cicadas into zombies and causes their private parts to fall off, Cooley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a real problem that &quot;is even stranger than science fiction,&quot; Cooley said. &quot;This is a sexually transmitted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/maryland-national-parks-see-first-cases-zombie-deer-disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;zombie disease&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooley has seen areas in the Midwest where up to 10% of the individuals were infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus is also the type that has hallucinatory effects on birds that would eat them, Cooley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This white fungus takes over the male, their gonads are torn from their body and chalky spores are spread around to nearby other cicadas, he said. The insects are sterilized, not killed. This way the fungus uses the cicadas to spread to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They&apos;re completely at the mercy of the fungus,&quot; Cooley said. &quot;They&apos;re walking dead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Russia has detained suspects in Caucasus linked to Moscow terror attack, security agency says</title>
                    
                    <description>Russia&amp;apos;s Federal Security Service says that it has broken up a terrorist cell whose members &amp;quot;directly participated in financing the perpetrators&amp;quot; of the Moscow terror attack.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Russia&apos;s top security agency said Monday it has broken up what it called a &quot;terrorist cell&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in southern Russia&lt;/a&gt; whose members had provided weapons and cash to suspected attackers of the Moscow concert hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Security Service, or FSB, said that on Sunday it detained four suspected members of the cell in the Russian province of Dagestan in the North Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency alleged that the suspects detained in Dagestan were involved in channeling funds and providing weapons to the gunmen who attacked the concert hall on Moscow&apos;s western edge on March 22, killing 144 people in the deadliest attack on Russian soil in two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/russian-special-unit-linked-havana-syndrome-sickened-us-officials-overseas-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUSSIAN SPECIAL UNIT LINKED TO HAVANA SYNDROME THAT SICKENED US OFFICIALS OVERSEAS: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The detained militants directly participated in financing the perpetrators of the March 22 terror &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;attack on the Crocus City Hall&lt;/a&gt; in Moscow and providing them with terror means,&quot; the FSB said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said one of the suspects detained in Dagestan had confessed to personally bringing weapons to the Moscow attackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FSB released a video showing one of the suspects saying that they also planned an attack in the city of Kaspiysk in Dagestan. It wasn’t clear whether the two confessions came from the same person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency said the suspects are foreign nationals, without specifying their nationality. The suspected attackers of the Moscow concert hall arrested hours after the March 22 raid are citizens of the Central Asian nation of Tajikistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The detention of four suspects in Dagestan follows the arrest of the four suspected gunmen and seven others who were accused of involvement in the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged that &quot;radical Islamists&quot; conducted the raid, but alleged - without providing evidence - that Ukraine and the West were involved, despite Kyiv&apos;s vehement denials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
