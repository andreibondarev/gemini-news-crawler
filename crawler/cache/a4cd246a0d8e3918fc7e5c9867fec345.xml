                    <title>King Charles gives Prince William controversial military honor after &apos;cruel snub&apos; to Prince Harry</title>
                    
                    <description>King Charles honored Prince William with the title Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps. It was once thought the title would go to Prince Harry, who served with the Corps.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/king-charles-struggles-evict-prince-andrew-disgraced-royals-home-disrepair-experts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;King Charles III&lt;/a&gt; gave Prince William a military title that was once linked to Prince Harry, in a controversial move Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His Majesty bestowed the honor of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-middleton-mend-prince-william-goes-first-overnight-trip-since-cancer-diagnosis-expert&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Prince William&lt;/a&gt; in a ceremony held at the Army Aviation Centre. The title made Prince William the commander of Prince Harry&apos;s former Army Air Corps regiment. Before Prince Harry stepped down from his royal duties, many believed the title would be given to the Duke of Sussex due to the time he served with the Army Air Corps in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ceremony happened days after a spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital that Prince Harry wouldn&apos;t meet with King Charles while in London due to the king&apos;s packed schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty’s full programme,&quot; a spokesperson told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/king-charles-gives-prince-harry-slap-face-announcement-refusing-see-son-expert&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KING CHARLES GIVES PRINCE HARRY ‘SLAP IN THE FACE’ WITH ANNOUNCEMENT AFTER REFUSING TO SEE HIS SON: EXPERT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Duke, of course, is understanding of his father’s diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his short visit to the U.K., Harry and Meghan Markle spent several days touring Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-harry-wont-meet-king-charles-during-trip-uk-invictus-games-anniversary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;King Charles choosing not to see Prince Harry&lt;/a&gt; while he was in London and the military honor given to the Prince of Wales was a &quot;calculated&quot; and &quot;cruel snub,&quot; a royal expert told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If there were any doubts that Harry is dead to his father and brother, then this one-two punch from King Charles should dispel them once and for all,&quot; Christopher Andersen, author of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/King-Life-Charles-III/dp/1501181599/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;sr=&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;The King&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; said. &quot;By announcing that he was too busy to see Harry, even though the two men are just two miles apart, and then officially giving Harry&apos;s colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corps title to William – one of the honorary military titles Harry cherished most – the king is slamming the door in Harry&apos;s face.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This was a calculated, even cruel snub,&quot; Andersen added. &quot;Under other circumstances, I would have chalked it up to the fatal tone-deafness that the palace is so famous for. But the king could easily have carved out time to see Harry, and the announcement giving Harry&apos;s old title to William didn&apos;t have to happen just as Harry arrived in London. This was all very deliberate and very petty – and very personal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prince Harry has seemingly made an effort to see his cancer-stricken father. Shortly after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/king-charles-kate-middletons-cancer-battles-make-them-more-relatable-british-public-experts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Charles&apos; cancer diagnosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was announced in February, Prince Harry flew over 5,000 miles to visit his ailing father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Prince Harry&apos;s trip to England at that time was short, according to royal experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was there for 24 hours, he saw his father for 45 minutes, he flew – and announced to the press – after the king’s statement was released, even though we later heard that he was told beforehand, and he didn’t see his sister-in-law or nieces and nephews even though they are also dealing with a traumatic health recovery,&quot; Shannon Felton Spence told Fox News Digital at the time. &quot;It’s hard to view it as anything other than an image saver for Harry. And that pains me, because I was really hoping this was the news he needed to wake him up and fix it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harry spent time with His Majesty at Clarence House, but did not meet with his brother, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-harry-leaves-uk-king-charles-visit-without-meeting-prince-william&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Prince William.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I spoke to him,&quot; Prince Harry later told &quot;Good Morning America&quot; about his meeting with King Charles. &quot;I jumped on a plane and went to go see him as soon as I could.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look, I love my family,&quot; he added. &quot;The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I’m grateful for that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Ashley Papa contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>First lady Jill Biden called for free community college tuition during a commencement address to Mesa Community College in Arizona as the administration fights for student debt cancellation.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;First lady Jill Biden called for community college education to be &quot;free in America&quot; during her commencement address in Arizona to Mesa Community College&apos;s class of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Saturday event in Tempe, on Arizona State University&apos;s campus, Biden&apos;s call was met with cheers from those assembled, as she further spoke about her own role as an educator at a Virginia community college while her husband serves in the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On behalf of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cms.foxnews.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=6023208&amp;amp;action=edit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt;, Vice President Harris, and the Second Gentleman: Congratulations, Class of 2024, we are so proud of you,&quot; Biden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I teach at a community college for the same reason students go to community colleges. They’re flexible and meet people where they are. And, as my husband, President Biden, says, they provide the &apos;best career training in America.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-plan-free-community-college-expanded-loan-programs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLASHBACK: BIDEN&apos;S 2020 PLAN FOR FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE, EXPANDED LOAN PROGRAMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden praised Mesa Community College&apos;s &quot;Promise&quot; program, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mesacc.edu/mesa-promise&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;its website describes&lt;/a&gt; as a needs-based commitment from the city of Mesa to residents that eligible students can attend the school without paying tuition or registration fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Community colleges should be free in America,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first lady&apos;s remarks come as the Biden administration continues to take heat over its machinations to cancel student loan debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2023, the Supreme Court ruled against the administration, in asserting 6-3 that federal law does not permit Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to cancel more than $430 billion in student loan debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/gop-rep-jabs-education-secretary-debt-forgiveness-hearing-car-loans-next&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOP REP JABS EDUCATION SECRETARY OVER DEBT FORGIVENESS: ‘ARE CAR LOANS NEXT?&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-brags-supreme-court-stop-canceling-student-loans-happy-break-law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden, in turn,&lt;/a&gt; received blowback for saying the high bench &quot;didn&apos;t stop me&quot; after &quot;my MAGA Republican friends&quot; sued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One critic wrote on X that &quot;one of the ‘nobody is above the law’ people is debunking that again,&quot; while Rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga., said, &quot;the decay of checks and balances isn&apos;t a flex.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his 2020 campaign platform, Biden called for making community colleges and tech schools free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, an analysis by The Associated Press suggested that the cost of his proposal stopped short of the $1 trillion mark, a figure associated with the more expansive education funding plans championed by his progressive counterparts, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Biden&apos;s 2025 fiscal budget also seeks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-gop-exposes-woke-items-bidens-7-3-trillion-budget&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;$90 billion to expand&lt;/a&gt; access to free community college despite congressional and judicial resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a hearing last week before the House Education &amp;amp; Workforce Committee, Cardona was confronted by a Republican member over the administration&apos;s overall efforts to forgive student debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., pointedly asked if car loans are next on the administration&apos;s debt-cancellation agenda, while also appearing to suggest the administration sees themselves as &quot;above the law.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Secretary, President Biden&apos;s Department of Education has canceled $153 billion in student loans, with plans to cancel $1.4 trillion. The House of Representatives said no – We actually passed legislation on that – The Senate said no. The Fifth Circuit Court said no. And the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court, said no,&quot; McClain said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yet you continue to march on. I would like to know what makes you qualified to ignore the majority of Congress and the Supreme Court.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Lindsay Kornick, Elizabeth Elkind and The Associated Press contributed to this report&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Michael Cohen testified in a Manhattan court he secretly recorded Donald Trump in the lead-up to the 2016 election regarding repaying publisher David Pecker.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Former President Trump&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; former attorney secretly recorded the president ahead of the 2016 election, according to Cohen&apos;s witness testimony Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen testified during Trump&apos;s 16th day in court that he secretly recorded Trump on his iPhone on Sept. 6, 2016 - just weeks before the general election - regarding a payment to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker. According to the testimony, Pecker had paid former Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 to purchase her story that she had an affair with Trump and to subsequently quiet her claims ahead of the election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pecker had pressed Cohen that Trump needed to pay him back, with Cohen secretly recording Trump on Sept. 6 of the election year as proof Trump planned to pay Pecker, according to the testimony. Cohen added that in addition to easing Pecker&apos;s mind that he would be repaid, he also made the recording in order to keep Pecker &quot;loyal&quot; to Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-defenders-show-up-force-ahead-cohen-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP, DEFENDERS SHOW UP IN FORCE AHEAD OF COHEN TESTIMONY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recording was played for the jury, which included Cohen telling Trump he needed to &quot;open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David,&quot; referring to Pecker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-cohens-credibility-issues-brazen-tiktok-usage-raise-media-eyebrows-ahead-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL COHEN&apos;S CREDIBILITY ISSUES, BRAZEN TIKTOK USAGE RAISE MEDIA EYEBROWS AHEAD OF TESTIMONY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?&quot; Trump is heard saying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen argued in his testimony that Trump knew Pecker had purchased the rights to McDougal&apos;s claims of an affair and agreed to pay $150,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He already knew based upon conversation with David, which is why he mentioned the number 150,&quot; Cohen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen testified that he recorded the exchange while holding his iPhone while sitting across a desk from Trump. Trump was unaware he was being recorded at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/may-13-trump-trial-michael-cohen-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL COHEN EXPECTED TO TAKE THE STAND AS NY V. TRUMP TRIAL RESUMES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case revolves around the alleged falsification of business records. Prosecutors say Cohen paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to quiet her claims of the alleged extramarital sexual encounter with Trump. Prosecutors allege the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen and fraudulently logged the payments as legal expenses, and are working to prove that Trump falsified records with the intent to commit or conceal a second crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has pleaded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;not guilty in the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniels took the stand last week, saying she met Trump in 2006 at Lake Tahoe during a celebrity golf tournament. She alleged that the pair had sex in Trump&apos;s hotel room during the event, which Trump has repeatedly denied in public comments. Daniels also described to the court how she got into the pornography business after working &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/strip-club-sued-dancers-over-socialist-tip-system&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;as an exotic dancer&lt;/a&gt; as a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

He held the American flag outside his No. 6 Castrol car as fans in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/south-carolina&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; cheered him on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Keselowski’s wife, Paige, posted a video on social media showing their daughter taking the American flag that he held into school with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No one happier than this girl,&quot; Paige Keselowski wrote on X. &quot;She wanted to take the race winning flag to school today so her class could use it for the pledge of allegiance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Paigekeselowski/status/1790003298763714972&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW THE POST ON X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad Keselowski moved into the lead late in the race after Tyler Reddick &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chris-buescher-angrily-confronts-tyler-reddick-after-late-race-incident-at-darlington&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;slid up the track&lt;/a&gt; and made contact with Chris Buescher. Ty Gibbs finished second, Josh Berry was third, Denny Hamlin was fourth, and Chase Briscoe rounded out the top five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/brad-keselowski-ford-snap-winless-skids-at-darlington&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NASCAR TAKEAWAYS: BRAD KESELOWSKI, FORD SNAP WINLESS SKIDS AT DARLINGTON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buescher and Reddick finished 30th and 32nd respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What a heck of a day,&quot; Keselowski said, via NASCAR.com. &quot;It’s Darlington, so whether it’s your first win, your last win, this is a really special track. The history of NASCAR, it’s as tough as it gets, and that battle at the end with my teammate and Tyler Reddick, we just laid it all out on the line, it was freaking awesome.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed to only be a matter of time before Keselowski got back to Victory Lane. After finishing 33rd at Daytona and Atlanta earlier in the year, he put together four top five finishes. He was 11th last week at Kansas and eighth at Richmond back in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He moved up four spots in the standings to 11th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>In Sudan, 72 villages burned last month as fire &apos;used indiscriminately as weapon of war,&apos; study says</title>
                    
                    <description>In Sudan&amp;apos;s civil war, fire is being used to burn villages and displace civilians with more frequency than before. April 2024 saw more fires than any other month of the war.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fires resulting from the fighting in Sudan destroyed or damaged 72 villages and settlements last month, a U.K.-based rights group said Monday, highlighting the use of fire as a weapon of war in the conflict in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/africa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the African country&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators from Sudan Witness, an open-source project run by the nonprofit Center for Information Resilience, say that more blazes broke out than in any other month since the war started in mid-April 2023. The number also brings to 201 the total number of fires in Sudan since fighting broke out between Sudan&apos;s military and the rival paramilitary force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis didn&apos;t provide any casualty figures from the fires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/south-sudan-mediation-talks-launched-kenya-hope-ending-conflict&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOUTH SUDAN MEDIATION TALKS LAUNCHED IN KENYA WITH A HOPE OF ENDING CONFLICT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the war in Sudan, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have often used fire, setting entire villages ablaze, especially in Sudan&apos;s western Darfur region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Center for Information Resilience said the number of fires surged particularly in the north and west of el-Fasher, the capital city of North Darfur state that faces an imminent attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El-Fasher saw intense fighting on Friday between the Sudanese military and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/sudanese-paramilitary-carries-ethnic-cleansing-darfur&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the paramilitary RSF&lt;/a&gt; and their allies. At least 27 people were killed and dozens injured, said the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA. More than 800 were displaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sudan&apos;s military launched an airstrike the next day that hit close to a pediatric hospital in el-Fasher, killing two children and a caregiver, according to Doctors Without Borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its analysis, the Center for Information Resilience estimated that 31 settlements — villages and towns — were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/disasters/fires&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;affected by fires&lt;/a&gt; in April, with an over 50% destruction rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’ve documented the patterns of numerous fires and the continuing devastation to settlements around western Sudan, large and small,&quot; Anouk Theunissen, Sudan Witness project director, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When we see reports of fighting or airstrikes coinciding with clusters of fires it indicates that fire is being used indiscriminately as a weapon of war. The trend is worsening and continues to lead to the mass displacement of Sudanese people,&quot; Theunissen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sudan&apos;s conflict started when tensions between the Sudanese military and the RSF broke out into intense fighting in Khartoum, the country&apos;s capital in April last year. Clashes quickly spread to other parts of Sudan, including Darfur, which has been witnessing brutal attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sudan Witness analysis also said that in the Sudan war, blazes have hit at least 51 settlements for displaced people more than once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators with the project examined the patterns of fires across the war-torn country by using social media, satellite imagery and NASA&apos;s public fire monitoring data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Celebrate law enforcement during National Police Week</title>
                    
                    <description>President Kennedy started National Police Week in 1961 to show gratitude and appreciation for the men and women in local law enforcement.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;National Police Week is a notable opportunity to show acknowledgment, appreciation and respect for law enforcement officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Police officers&lt;/a&gt; pledge to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against enemies both foreign and domestic, serve and protect against crime in communities, safeguard lives and much more. Their service to everyday Americans on a daily basis is a sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While police officers should be regarded daily, National Police Week (May 12 - May 18) is a great time to emphatically thank law enforcement for putting their lives on the line in order to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;serve and protect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the list below for a few suggestions on how to say &quot;thank you&quot; to those who exhibit bravery every day through their service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/national-police-week-cops-jim-banks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NATIONAL POLICE WEEK IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW COPS WE HAVE THEIR BACKS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police officers are out and about just like everyday Americans. These men and women take their kids to school and stop at local coffee shops. If you see a police officer in passing during National Police Week, smile and thank them for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;service as law enforcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While showing simple gratitude for their work can go a long way, if you are very excited about speaking with an officer, elaborate on what you are grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways to express gratitude that go further than a &quot;thank you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/retired-police-officers-viral-videos-warns-parents-kids-exposed-tiktok&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RETIRED POLICE OFFICER&apos;S VIRAL VIDEOS WARN PARENTS ABOUT WHAT THEIR KIDS ARE BEING EXPOSED TO ON TIKTOK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you love to cook or bake, you may be tempted to whip something up in your own kitchen for your local police department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the safest way to prevent foodborne illness is to purchase something from a local bakery, restaurant or dessert shop. While officers may appreciate a home-cooked meal, avoid the risk of causing illness if the food does not carry well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cookies, donuts, cupcakes, pizza, wings, boxes of coffee or containers of cold brew, bagels and cream cheese, sandwich trays and other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;catering food items&lt;/a&gt; are shareable options to offer your local police department during National Police Week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fewer people are writing and sending mail since living in a digital world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often a surprise to many when receiving a piece of mail, addressed to a person or a whole department with a handwritten notation. Gather your family after dinner to write letters of thanks or have children color pictures and mail them to the department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to get a group to do this same thing, it only takes one person to initiate the project and gather everyone to participate.

However, the defund the police movement that wreaked havoc on large cities across America beginning in 2020 may have discouraged many police officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hosting a gathering with food, drinks and plenty of family and friends is a way to not only show appreciation, but to allow officers to ease some stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encourage them to relax, enjoy togetherness and completely bask in their celebration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/ohio-police-officer-military-veteran-killed-line-duty-ambush-suspect-at-large&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;police officers are killed&lt;/a&gt; in the line of duty on a monthly basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, 137 deaths of police officers were reported by the Officer Down Memorial Page. Over 35% of these deaths were from gunfire, over 16% from car crashes and over 7% from vehicular homicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police associations and research foundations related to American law enforcement collect donations annually in order to build on their missions, enhance law enforcement trainings, educate citizens about the police force and local safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund seeks donor contributions to maintain memorial grounds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;fallen police heroes&lt;/a&gt;, organize National Police Week events, provide places of remembrance and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a quiet way to support local law enforcement, consider donating to a non-profit foundation or reputable association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Indonesian police say they have raided a major drug lab hidden in a villa on the resort island of Bali. Police arrested four people allegedly linked to the lab.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Indonesian police&lt;/a&gt; raided what they said was a major drug lab hidden in a villa on the resort island of Bali, and arrested four people, authorities said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police raided the house in the upscale resort area of Canggu early this month, said Wahyu Widada, head of the National Police’s Criminal Investigation Department, finding two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/drugs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;drug labs&lt;/a&gt; in its basement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said one of the villa&apos;s labs was designed to produce the ingredients for ecstasy, and the other contained a hydroponic farm marijuana. Police were tipped off to the facility after an earlier raid on a Jakarta lab linked to Indonesia&apos;s most wanted drug lord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/indonesia-police-probe-drug-regulator-cough-syrup-linked-200-child-deaths&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INDONESIA POLICE PROBE DRUG REGULATOR OVER COUGH SYRUP LINKED TO 200 CHILD DEATHS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police arrested an Indonesian man identified by his initial as LM, two Ukrainian men identified as IV and MV, and a Russian man identified as KK, during the raids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four men could face execution. Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation, has strict laws against consumption of marijuana and other drugs, even for medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the more than 150 people on Indonesia’s death row were convicted of drug crimes, about one-third of whom are foreigners. The country’s last executions were in 2016, when one Indonesian and three foreigners were shot by a firing squad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widada said police were tipped off to the &quot;clandestine&quot; labs after interrogating a suspected drug trafficker arrested in an April raids in the capital, Jakarta, on a similar lab that police say was owned by drug lord Freddy Pratama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widada said one of the men arrested this month, LM, was Pratama’s accountant, and was involved in operating a drug lab in Jakarta before moving to Bali to avoid arrest. He was arrested at a rented house near Kuta, a popular tourist spot, with 13.2 pounds of crystal methamphetamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widada said that IV and MV arrested as investors and drug makers at the Bali labs, while KK was accused of selling drugs for them, adding that police are searching for two more dealers, Ukrainian men identified as RN and OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearing orange detainee uniforms, the suspects were paraded with their hands tied at a news conference in Denpasar, the capital of Bali province.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police seized hundreds of pounds of precursor chemicals for ecstasy and equipment for growing marijuana, including ultraviolet lighting and an automatic watering system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Indonesia’s Constitutional Court rejected a judicial review of the country’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;narcotics law&lt;/a&gt; that would have paved the way for legalizing marijuana for medicinal use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says Indonesia is a major smuggling hub despite having some of the strictest drug laws in the world, in part because international drug syndicates target its young population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Though there was much speculation surrounding why the friends stopped speaking, neither ever publicly addressed the real reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E! picked up the show for seasons four and five before it ended on Aug. 5, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the women are very close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/paris-hilton-praises-gop-lawmakers-sponsoring-bipartisan-stop-institutional-child-abuse-act&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PARIS HILTON PRAISES GOP LAWMAKERS FOR SPONSORING BIPARTISAN STOP INSTITUTIONAL CHILD ABUSE ACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richie shares one daughter, Harlow Madden, with her husband of 14 years, &quot;Good Charlotte&quot; band member, Joel Madden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, she founded lifestyle brand House of Harlow 1960 and in 2021, she teamed up with her sister &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lionel-richie-daughter-sofia-richie-marries-music-executive-elliot-grainge-south-france&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sofia Richie&lt;/a&gt; for a line of ready-to-wear clothing under the brand and sold at Revolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilton, a successful and popular DJ, shares two children, Phoenix and London, with her husband Carter Reum.

If I said anything negative about anything that was happening, they would immediately hang up the phone and punish me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Hilton released &quot;Paris: The Memoir,&quot; which contains sensitive content, including sexual abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what date the new reality show with Hilton and Richie will launch.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Cowboys&apos; Micah Parsons weighs in on NBA-NFL player debate: &apos;It ain’t hard to dunk&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Dallas Cowboys pass rusher Micah Parsons pushed back former NBA guard Lou Williams&amp;apos; assertion that the NBA-NFL player debate isn&amp;apos;t a &amp;quot;physicality conversation.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/dallas-cowboys&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; star Micah Parsons weighed in on the debate over whether NBA players could fit into the NFL and vice versa as he responded to former guard Lou Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams, a three-time Sixth Man of the Year winner, said on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELp4RinQU50&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Underground Lounge&quot;&lt;/a&gt; he thought &quot;everybody should respect everybody’s craft.&quot; He didn’t think there were 30 NBA players who could play in the NFL nor did he think the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My problem where this conversation is going is I don’t like the fact that the NFL players are saying, their argument is, ‘Y’all soft. Y’all flop.’ This and that,&quot; Williams said. &quot;Let’s be clear, y’all motherf---ers flop too. Is football more than running, jumping, catching? Hell yeah. It’s agility It’s smart. It’s chess. It’s being able to beat your man off the line. Trying to teach somebody in front of you that’s trying to beat you off the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I respect all of that s---. But when we start getting into the conversation about basketball players being soft this and that, basketball is way more contact than we get credit for. There’s p---ies on both sides, bro. I don’t want this conversation to get swayed like we the only ones p---ies. No, no. I see some of y’all n----s catching that ball getting down too. Let’s not make this a physicality conversation. Let’s talk about skill.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parsons responded to Williams in a post on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I dead a-- watch mf go 0 points and play 30 minutes ! I it ain’t hard to dunk or make a lay up,&quot; he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/jason-kelce-believes-turn-lebron-james-greatest-redzone-threat-nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JASON KELCE BELIEVES HE COULD TURN LEBRON JAMES INTO THE &apos;GREATEST REDZONE THREAT IN THE NFL&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parsons participated in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game in February. He scored 37 points and grabbed 16 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire debate started last week when Austin Rivers claimed he could take &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;30 NBA players&lt;/a&gt; and work them seamlessly into the NFL, during an interview on &quot;The Pat McAfee Show.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You cannot take 30 NFL players and put them in the NBA,&quot; Rivers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/jj-watt-roasts-austin-rivers-implying-nba-players-could-play-nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;criticism from J.J. Watt&lt;/a&gt;, Rivers further explained his points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;@JJWatt played 11 years [in the NBA] broski. Might play next year in fact… that would make it 12,&quot; Rivers posted, &quot;..like someone I know. Respect your [sic] a football legend holding it down for the bros. My comments weren’t meant to be disrespectful. Only a point to how athletically gifted SOME NBA players are…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;U don’t think Ant man [Anthony Edwards] could make that transition to the NFL? Wide receiver? Prime Lebron? Zion [Williamson]? Prime d rose [Derrick Rose] or [Russell] Westbrook? Aaron Gordon at tight end? Now give me yours for the NFL to the NBA… I’ll wait. Notice I never said myself btw. So easy on the shade towards me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Scott Thompson contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A California mother died saving her drowning daughter in the San Joaquin River May 9, the Stanislaus County Sheriff&amp;apos;s Office said.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A mother&apos;s love knows no boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was especially true on May 9 when Brenda Duran jumped into the San Joaquin River in central California to rescue her drowning daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mom watched her children playing in the water of a popular beach, but when her 11-year-old daughter could not keep her head above water, Duran rushed into the river, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Stanislaus County Sheriff&apos;s Office.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she sought to save her daughter, Duran &quot;struggled to stay afloat,&quot; the sheriff&apos;s office said, and the river&apos;s current swallowed the mom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/americans-stranded-norwegian-cruise-save-elderly-passenger-family-says-ship-left-her-die&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;AMERICANS, INCLUDING SOUTH CAROLINA COUPLE, STRANDED BY NORWEGIAN CRUISE SAVE ELDERLY PASSENGER, FAMILY SAYS: SHIP ‘LEFT HER TO DIE’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her son, 14, saw his mom in trouble and jumped back into the river to try to grab her, but he could not get to her in time, according to the Stanislaus County Sheriff&apos;s Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was around 6:30 p.m. on May 9. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;First responders&lt;/a&gt;, including rescue dive teams, spent hours in the water, but &quot;visibility and safety&quot; concerns forced the search to be paused around 11 p.m., police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/search-missing-south-carolina-cruise-passenger-complicated-jungle-terrain-family-demands-us-help&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOLUNTEERS&apos; SEARCH FOR MISSING DAD WHO DISAPPEARED DURING CRUISE EXCURSION COMPLICATED BY JUNGLE TERRAIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duran&apos;s body was recovered around 5:30 p.m. on May 11 outside Newman, California. She was just 30 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Brenda&apos;s husband describes her as a ‘very thriving person, always smiling, never giving up and very compassionate,’&quot; Yadira Herrera wrote on a GoFundMe post on behalf of Duran&apos;s family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Brenda, a young mother full of love and laughter, leaves behind her three children, her husband and her extended family that will forever hold her in her heart.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stanislaus County Sheriff&apos;s Office said an autopsy will be conducted later this week to establish an official cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We extend our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Brenda Duran during this time,&quot; the sheriff&apos;s office said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 366-mile San Joaquin River starts in Yosemite and Kings Canyon National Parks and runs through the San Joaquin Valley south of Sacramento. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The river is known for its teeming wildlife, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/travel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;economy-fueled tourism&lt;/a&gt; that includes paddling, swimming and fishing, and hydroelectric power.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Kazakhstani ex-government official sentenced for wife&apos;s torture and murder in Central Asia</title>
                    
                    <description>Kazakhstan’s Supreme Court has convicted a former government official of torturing and brutally murdering his wife and sentenced him to prison, officials say.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan&apos;s Supreme Court on Monday convicted a former government official of torturing and murdering his wife and sentenced him to 24 years in prison in a case that has gripped the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/asia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Central Asian&lt;/a&gt; nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the trial of Kuandyk Bishimbayev, Kazakhstan’s former economy minister, over the death of his wife, Saltanat Nukenova, thousands of people urged the authorities to adopt harsher penalties for domestic violence. Authorities adopted a bill toughening spousal abuse laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan largely remains a patriarchal society, and progress has been slow on issues such as domestic violence, sexual harassment and disparities in employment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/domestic-violence-rates-remain-high-three-years-record-spike-pandemic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RATES REMAIN HIGH THREE YEARS AFTER RECORD SPIKE DURING PANDEMIC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bishimbayev’s trial was the first in the country of over 19 million people to be streamed online, and debates about it dominated social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nukenova, 31, was found dead in November in a restaurant owned by one of her husband’s relatives. The 44-year-old Bishimbayev maintained his innocence before admitting in court last month that he had beaten her and &quot;unintentionally&quot; caused her death. His lawyers initially disputed medical evidence indicating Nukenova died from blows to the head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bishimbayev&apos;s relative, Bakhytzhan Baizhanov, was sentenced to four years in prison for helping Bishimbayev cover up the murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days after Nukenova’s death, her relatives launched an online petition urging authorities to pass &quot;Saltanat’s Law&quot; to bolster protection for those at risk of domestic violence. It quickly got over 150,000 signatures. As the trial began, more than 5,000 Kazakhs wrote senators urging &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;tougher laws&lt;/a&gt; on abuse, Kazakh media said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has repeatedly spoken about strengthening protections for women. In January, he intervened after the Justice Ministry refused to consider the petition by Nukenova’s family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a 2018 study backed by UN Women, about 400 women die from domestic violence each year in Kazakhstan, although many cases go unreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Kazakhstan decriminalized beatings and other acts causing &quot;minor&quot; physical damage, making them punishable only by fines or short jail terms. Kazakhstan has since reversed its law, increasing penalties for assailants and introducing new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;criminal offenses&lt;/a&gt;, including harassment of minors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senate Speaker Maulen Ashimbayev said that properly implementing the new law adopted in the wake of the trial will require &quot;a great deal of work,&quot; including educational campaigns in schools and the media as well as vigilance from civil society groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Democrat Sen. Bob Menendez faces second federal corruption trial with jury selection starting Monday</title>
                    
                    <description>Jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday in the trial against New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez., on allegations he acted to benefit foreign governments</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-see-embattled-menendezs-potential-independent-bid-chance-flip-senate-seat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sen. Bob Menendez&lt;/a&gt;, D-N.J., is facing his second federal corruption trial in a decade, as jury selection is scheduled to begin in Manhattan federal court on Monday, this time related to charges alleging that he acted to benefit the governments of Egypt and Qatar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 70-year-old New Jersey Democrat and his wife, Nadine Menendez, are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/corruption&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;accused of accepting bribes&lt;/a&gt; from three wealthy businessmen – real estate developer Fred Daibes, Wael Hana and Jose Uribe – in his home state and performing a variety of favors in return, including meddling in criminal investigations and taking actions benefiting the governments of Egypt and Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menendez, 70, will stand trial along with two of the businessmen, Daibes and Hana. All three have pleaded not guilty. Uribe has pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against the other defendants. A trial for the senator’s wife, who is also charged, is delayed until at least July for health reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three-term senator has announced he will not be seeking reelection on the Democratic ticket this fall, although he has not ruled out running as an independent. That could complicate things for Democrats who have a narrow edge in the U.S. Senate and can hardly afford the prospect of a three-way election in the Democratic stronghold of New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-house-dems-defend-texas-congressman-accused-accepting-mexican-bribes-very-different-reasons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP, HOUSE DEMS DEFEND TEXAS CONGRESSMAN ACCUSED OF ACCEPTING MEXICAN BRIBES, BUT FOR VERY DIFFERENT REASONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday saw several new court filings from defense teams, but the judge has yet to rule on those matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for Menendez accused prosecutors of not acting in good faith by seeking to have members of the Qatari Investment Company, who have already been interviewed by government counsel, avoid cross examination at trial. The senators’ lawyers allege &quot;the government knows from their meetings with the Qatari Investment Company Deponents’ counsel and with one of the Qatari Investment Company Deponents that the Deponents’ testimony would disprove the story the government wants to tell.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam Fee and Avi Weitzman, Menendez’s lawyers, said the &quot;government will do whatever it can to prevent the jury from hearing the truth from the Qatari Investment Company Deponents, while also presenting to the jury dozens of communications from those very same witnesses.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Court should not reward the government’s sharp tactics,&quot; they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, current and former attorneys for Uribe, who is expected to testify as a witness at trial in the government’s case, accuse Menendez of &quot;a blatant and improper attempt to end-run around the discovery limitations&quot; through &quot;three facially improper subpoenas,&quot; which seek information about Uribe’s plea agreement with prosecutors, payments Uribe made toward Menendez’s wife’s Mercedes-Benz and other communications and documents. Uribe pleaded guilty on March 1 pursuant to a cooperation agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Indeed, it appears that by serving not one but three clearly and facially defective subpoenas, failing to respond to Uribe’s counsel’s objections and requests to withdraw them, and disguising a Rule 17(c) subpoena as one for trial testimony, Menendez and his counsel are intentionally attempting to create an inappropriate burden on – and distraction for – Uribe shortly before the trial begins,&quot; Uribe&apos;s lawyers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After charges were announced in September, Menendez was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democratic-sen-bob-menendez-steps-down-temporairly-chairman-senate-foreign-relations-committe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;forced out of his powerful post&lt;/a&gt; as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senator&apos;s political career had its first major crisis in 2015 when he was indicted on charges involving a wealthy Florida eye doctor accused of buying Menendez’s influence through luxury vacations and campaign contributions. At the time, Menendez resolutely denied the charges and vowed not to quit the Senate. A trial ended in 2017 with a deadlocked jury, and federal prosecutors in New Jersey abandoned the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menendez not only stayed in Congress, he was reelected and kept his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee. He married Nadine Menendez in 2020 after the couple dated for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new case, federal prosecutors stressed that FBI agents who searched the senator&apos;s New Jersey home allegedly found a stash of gold bars, worth more than $100,000, and more than $486,000 in cash, some of it stuffed into the pockets of clothing hanging in his closets in a raid two years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menendez has remained in the Senate amid this latest indictment, ignoring calls for him to step down before his six-year term ends Jan. 3. Unlike in 2015, though, his party has largely abandoned him. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and others called on him to resign. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rep-andy-kim-gains-traction-bid-new-jerseys-senate-seat-primary-victories-3-counties&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Democratic Rep. Andy Kim&lt;/a&gt; launched a campaign for Menendez’s seat the day after the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-bob-menendez-may-blame-wife-nadine-federal-corruption-trial-court-docs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEN BOB MENENDEZ MAY BLAME HIS WIFE NADINE DURING FEDERAL CORRUPTION TRIAL: COURT DOCS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His fellow Democrats in Washington, D.C., appear to have already written him off, encouraging him repeatedly to resign, but Menendez has maintained a defiant stance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am innocent and will prove it no matter how many charges they continue to pile on,&quot; he said after the indictment against him was updated again in early March to add charges that he tried to obstruct the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides charges including bribery, extortion, fraud and obstruction of justice, Menendez also is charged with acting as a foreign agent of Egypt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menendez has vigorously denied doing anything unusual in his dealings with foreign officials. The senator&apos;s lawyers in court papers have said they plan to explain that Menendez had no knowledge of some of what occurred because his wife, who allegedly often served as a conduit between the men paying the bribes, kept him in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to an indictment, Daibes delivered gold bars and cash to Menendez and his wife to get the senator&apos;s help with a multimillion-dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund, prompting Menendez to act in ways &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrat-sen-bob-menendez-charged-accepting-bribes-benefit-qatar-superseding-federal-indictment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;favorable to Qatar&apos;s government&lt;/a&gt;. The indictment also said Menendez did things benefiting Egyptian officials in exchange for bribes from Hana, as the businessman secured a valuable deal with the Egyptian government to certify that imported meat met Islamic dietary requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In pleading guilty several weeks ago, Uribe admitted buying Menendez&apos;s wife a Mercedes-Benz to get the senator&apos;s help to influence criminal investigations involving his business associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Sidney H. Stein has rejected Menendez’s attempt to claim legislative immunity protects him from the charges. The judge has yet to rule on whether the defense can call a psychiatrist to show Menendez habitually stored cash in his home as a &quot;fear of scarcity&quot; response to family stories about how their savings were confiscated in the Communist revolution in Cuba, before he was born, and because of financial problems stemming from the gambling problem of his father, a struggling carpenter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Jennifer Johnson and the Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>South Carolina woman Mica Miller&apos;s husband says he tried to &apos;raise her from the dead&apos; during eulogy</title>
                    
                    <description>South Carolina pastor John-Paul Miller on Saturday gave a eulogy for his late wife, Mica Miller, who died by suicide on April 27, saying he tried to &amp;quot;raise her from the dead.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide &amp;amp; Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Carolina pastor John-Paul Miller on Saturday remembered his late wife, Mica Miller, in a eulogy at his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/south-carolina&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Myrtle Beach congregation&lt;/a&gt;, saying at one point that he tried to &quot;raise her from the dead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mica Miller, 30, died by suicide on April 27 after calling authorities to her location at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/north-carolina&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Lumber River State Park in North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, about an hour&apos;s drive from Myrtle Beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller began his eulogy at his congregation called Solid Rock at Common Market by talking about his late wife&apos;s beauty, saying &quot;everyone knew how beautiful she was on the outside,&quot; but only &quot;a spouse knows how beautiful that person is on the inside.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She was beautiful on the outside. She won so many beautiful pageants when she was young,&quot; he said in the eulogy, which was posted to YouTube. &quot;…But I got to lay next to her body and spend time with her body about four times this week, and each time, it still didn&apos;t hit me. I thought she was gonna wake up. I even tried to raise her from the dead one time this week.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/mica-miller-911-call-reveals-final-moments-before-her-death-nc-authorities-challenge-conspiracy-theories&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MICA MILLER 911 CALL REVEALS FINAL MOMENTS BEFORE HER DEATH AS NC AUTHORITIES CHALLENGE ‘CONSPIRACY THEORIES’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pastor went on to describe Mica&apos;s zest for life and dedication to the church. He also described her love of travel for mission trips and other vacations to places like Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Disney World and Africa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robeson County Medical Examiner Richard Johnson ruled Miller died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 27. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Robeson County Sheriff Burnis Wilkins&lt;/a&gt; called the evidence &quot;quite clear and compelling.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/mica-miller-case-cause-death-revealed-south-carolina-pastors-wife&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MICA MILLER CASE: CAUSE OF DEATH REVEALED FOR SOUTH CAROLINA PASTOR&apos;S WIFE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While I know it’s not what many people wanted to hear, the evidence is quite clear and compelling, and we are as saddened as anyone that this occurred. There are many factors that we have reviewed that occurred over an extended period of time that are probably related to the reason for this investigation, but in the end, sadly, a tragic decision was made by Mica that ended her life,&quot; Wilkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John-Paul announced his wife&apos;s suicide April 28, the day after her death, ABC 15 reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mica Miller was in the process of formally separating from her husband, and had filed three &quot;separate support and maintenance&quot; requests since last year, the latest on April 16. Separate support and maintenance allows one spouse to receive court-ordered support from another spouse without officially divorcing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators determined that Mica purchased a 9mm Sig Sauer handgun from a pawn shop on the morning she allegedly died by suicide. Authorities found the gun case and a receipt for the purchase in her vehicle at Lumber River State Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/death-south-carolina-pastors-wife-under-investigation-family-warns-false-stories-suicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DEATH OF SOUTH CAROLINA PASTOR&apos;S WIFE UNDER INVESTIGATION AS HER FAMILY WARNS OF &apos;FALSE&apos; STORIES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They later recovered a 9mm Sig Sauer handgun where she was found dead, noting the same &quot;serial number on the weapon matched the gun box that was found in Miller’s Honda Accord.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 911 call made to Robseon County at 2:54 p.m., which was shared by the sheriff&apos;s office, Mica can be heard asking a dispatcher if she can track down her location. When the dispatcher says she tracked Mica to the Lumber River State Park, she asked Mica why she wanted her location known. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/husband-found-bodies-wife-kids-murder-suicide-im-dead-inside&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HUSBAND WHO FOUND BODIES OF WIFE, KIDS IN MURDER-SUICIDE: &apos;I&apos;M DEAD INSIDE&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tell me what happened,&quot; the dispatcher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m about to kill myself, and I just want my family to know where to find me,&quot; Mica can be heard saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/true-crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;GO HERE FOR MORE TRUE CRIME FROM FOX NEWS DIGITAL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robeson County Sheriff&apos;s Office investigators also determined that John-Paul &quot;and a female that he is allegedly romantically involved with&quot; were not in Robeson County at the time of Mica&apos;s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Investigators learned through interviews that John Paul Miller was at an athletic event in Charleston on the day of Mica Miller’s death. John Miller’s vehicle was observed traveling on Hwy 17 Bypass, in Horry County at 2:22 pm on April 27, 2024,&quot; the sheriff&apos;s office said in a press release. &quot;The investigation confirmed that John Miller was accompanied while traveling to and from the event in Charleston, SC.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A curator at the American Museum of Natural History was detained &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/turkey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; on Monday while allegedly attempting to smuggle spider and scorpion samples, Turkish media reported. The curator said he had permits from the government to conduct his research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenzo Prendini, an expert on arachnids at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York-based&lt;/a&gt; museum, was held by police at Istanbul Airport while allegedly trying to take about 1,500 samples out of the country, news outlets reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state-run Anadolu news agency reported that Prendini was detained for allegedly attempting to smuggle species found in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-man-charged-allegedly-smuggling-rare-butterflies-selling-them-ebay-etsy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK MAN CHARGED FOR ALLEGEDLY SMUGGLING $200K OF RARE BUTTERFLIES, SELLING THEM ON EBAY, ETSY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video published by the Demiroren News Agency showed officers searching hand luggage and removing plastic bags that appeared to be packed with dead spiders and scorpions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In emailed comments to The Associated Press, Prendini said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the police&lt;/a&gt; had disregarded permits from the Turkish government to conduct his research in collaboration with Turkish scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The police completely ignored this and relied on the testimony of an ‘expert’ who has a conflict of interest with my collaborators … and whose scientific research is highly questionable,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The police have completely violated due process, and it appears they would like to find me guilty in the court of public opinion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The museum’s website lists Prendini as the curator of its spider, scorpion, centipede and millipede collections. It says his research into spiders and scorpions has taken him to more than 30 countries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former President Trump has the edge in five of the six key battleground states where he was narrowly edged by &lt;a href=&quot;https://cms.foxnews.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=6023065&amp;amp;action=edit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden &lt;/a&gt;four years ago, according to new polls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surveys, released Monday by the New York Times, Siena College and the Philadelphia Inquirer, suggest that discontent over the economy and the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza, and a deterioration in support for Biden by younger, Black and Hispanic voters, &quot;threaten to unravel the president&apos;s Democratic coalition.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden topped Trump by razor-thin margins in the 2020 election in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to win the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, according to the new polls, with just under six months to go until Election Day, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trump leads&lt;/a&gt; Biden among registered voters 49%-42% in Arizona, 49%-39% in Georgia, 49%-42% in Michigan, 50%-38% in Nevada, and edges the president 47%-44% in Pennsylvania, with Biden narrowly on top in Wisconsin 47%-45%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tales-from-trail-trump-tries-expand-map-flipping-blue-states-red&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024 REMATCH: TRUMP AIMS TO EXPAND THE MAP IN HIS BATTLE WITH BIDEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2024 rematch between the Democratic president and his Republican predecessor was closer among the narrower pool of likely voters. Trump held the advantage in five states - Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin - with Biden edging ahead in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surveys&apos; findings were similar when third-party and independent candidates were added to the mix, including Democrat turned independent White House contender &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/k/robert-f-kennedy-jr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longtime environmental activist and high-profile vaccine skeptic, who is the scion of the nation&apos;s most storied political dynasty, was grabbing around 10% support across the six states. The polls suggested Kennedy was drawing roughly equally from both Biden and Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-and-trump-deadlocked-in-polls-six-months-out-from-2024-presidential-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POLLS INDICATE DEADLOCKED RACE WITH SIX MONTHS UNTIL ELECTION DAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/us/politics/biden-trump-battleground-poll.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;new surveys&lt;/a&gt;, conducted April 28 through May 9, come as Trump makes history as the first current or former president to stand trial in a criminal case. Additionally, they were also conducted amid a massive ad blitz by the Biden campaign across the key battleground states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &quot;the polls offer little indication that any of these developments have helped Mr. Biden, hurt Mr. Trump or quelled the electorate’s discontent,&quot; the New York Times writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surveys spotlight that voters are dissatisfied and itching for change. Nearly seven in 10 said that the nation&apos;s political and economic systems need major changes, or should be entirely torn down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly three-quarters said they believe Trump will bring major changes if he wins in November, compared to less than a quarter saying the same thing about the president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The polls also indicate Trump is making gains with voters who overwhelmingly supported Biden four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE 2024 ELECTION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump and Biden are roughly tied among voters 18–29 years old and Hispanic voters. The surveys also suggest the former president is grabbing over 20% of Black voters&apos; support, which, if it stands on Election Day, would be the highest level of backing by Black voters for a GOP presidential nominee in generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The polls suggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the economy &lt;/a&gt;continues to pull Biden down. Even though jobs are soaring and the stock market is booming, inflation remains a major issue for voters, even though it has cooled over the past year. More than half of those surveyed said they believe the economy is still &quot;poor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the president remains in contention, as the surveys point to Biden holding ground with older voters and White voters, whom the polls highlight &quot;are much less likely to demand fundamental changes to the system and far likelier to say that democracy is the most important issue for their vote.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abortion remains a potential problem for Trump. Nearly two-thirds of voters questioned in polls say that abortion should always or mostly be legal, including 44% of those supporting the former president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/13/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Over 4,000 voters&lt;/a&gt; in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were questioned in the polls, with an overall sampling error for all respondents of plus or minus 1.8 percentage points. The margin of error in the six states ranged from plus or minus 3.6 to 4.6 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Jen Psaki forced to edit book after making misleading claim about Biden not checking watch at ceremony</title>
                    
                    <description>Jen Psaki offered a misleading initial account in her new book of when President Biden was seen looking at his watch during a dignified transfer ceremony.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MSNBC host &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbcs-jen-psaki-surprised-analysts-admit-freakout-stage-trumps-jan-6-trial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jen Psaki&lt;/a&gt; said she will alter future reprints of her book after being called out for downplaying President Biden looking at his watch during a 2021 ceremony for U.S. service members who were killed in Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psaki, who was Biden&apos;s White House press secretary before joining MSNBC, initially claimed in her new book, &quot;Say More,&quot; that Biden never looked at his watch &quot;during the ceremony.&quot; But a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2024/05/13/psaki-book-biden-watch-check-afghanistan?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=editorial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;report by Axios&lt;/a&gt; noted that Psaki’s version contradicted pictures and Gold Star families&apos; firsthand accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psaki, who initially declined comment, changed her tune after online backlash and told Axios &quot;the detail in a few lines of the book about the exact number of times he looked at his watch will be removed in future reprints and the eBook.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soon-to-be removed version of Psaki’s book claimed &quot;the president looked at his watch only after the ceremony had ended,&quot; and the MSNBC star insisted Biden’s critics misrepresented the facts to make Biden appear insensitive. However, Gold Star families have long said they saw Biden check his watch multiple times during the dignified transfer ceremony. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/jen-psaki-urges-biden-join-the-view-defends-dodging-journalists&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JEN PSAKI URGES BIDEN TO JOIN ‘THE VIEW,’ DEFENDS HIM DODGING JOURNALISTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psaki says she told Biden that bringing up his personal experience with family deaths to grieving military family members was insensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The story on Afghanistan is really about the importance of delivering feedback even when it is difficult, told through my own experience of telling President Biden that his own story of loss was not well received by the families who were grieving their sons and daughters,&quot; Psaki told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt; when asked for additional comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, USA Today issued a correction on a &quot;fact check&quot; of the incident after initially claiming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden only checked his watch&lt;/a&gt; when the ceremony was over. USA Today took heat for suggesting the Gold Star families who alleged they saw Biden check his watch multiple times during the dignified transfer ceremony had lied, and the paper issued a correction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/usa-today-correction-fact-check-biden-watch.amp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USA TODAY ISSUES CORRECTION ON &apos;FACT CHECK&apos; AFTER CLAIMING BIDEN CHECKED WATCH &apos;ONLY AFTER CEREMONY&apos; AT DOVER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Corrections &amp;amp; Clarifications: This story was updated Sept. 2 to note that Biden checked his watch multiple times at the dignified transfer event, including during the ceremony itself,&quot; the correction read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psaki also mistakenly cited a Washington Post passage to bolster her account, Axios reported, when the sentences she cited actually came from USA Today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book, &quot;Say More: Lessons from Work, the White House, and the World,&quot; hit stores last week. Psaki, who joined MSNBC in May 2022 and has continued to be a reliable Biden supporter, was blasted by conservatives on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psaki joined MSNBC after a bidding war for her services between the left-leaning cable outlet and CNN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has been defensive about her past work for Biden, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/jen-psaki-erupts-comparisons-between-her-ronna-mcdaniel-truth-versus-lies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;objecting to comparisons&lt;/a&gt; between her and ex-Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel during the latter&apos;s brief tenure as an NBC News analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital’s Joseph A. Wulfsohn contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Experts stress the importance of modifying houses for safety to allow adults to stay in their homes for longer as residents get older and mobility becomes restricted.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With a majority of Americans preferring to live in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/longevity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;own homes as long as possible&lt;/a&gt;, experts stress the importance of modifications to keep dwellings safe and accessible. Here&apos;s a summary of tips from the National Institute on Aging and AARP, which offers a free room-by-room guide with practical suggestions for older adults living independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have at least one exterior doorway with step-free access. If not possible, consider a ramp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a bench in the foyer to sit on when removing shoes or to set down items while locking or unlocking the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/when-parent-must-care-parent-how-avoid-caregiving-burnout-according-experts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEN A PARENT MUST CARE FOR A PARENT: HOW TO AVOID CAREGIVING BURNOUT, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install a walk-in shower with a bench and nonskid decals or mats to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;prevent falls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a hand-held nozzle to the shower head to facilitate rinsing off while seated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install grab bars on the shower wall and near the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put in a taller toilet or add a toiler riser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider plugging in a nightlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If stairs are too difficult to manage, create a bedroom on the main level by transforming a den or an office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure the bed is easy to get in and out of. Purchase bed risers, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invest in an adjustable bed for extra comfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purchase a stove with safety features that alert the residents when a burner is on or has automatic shut-offs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relocate major appliances to make them easier to reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add slide-out drawers or trays to existing cabinets for better access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install a lever-style, light-touch or sensor faucet, which is easier to use than a faucet with turn-style knobs or handles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get rid of furniture and clutter to make rooms &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/house-and-home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;easier to move around in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replace chairs with armrests to make it easier to stand and sit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid furniture with sharp corners, which can cause bruises and cuts when bumped up against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hide cords out of pathways — but don’t put them under rugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Area rugs, if used, should be secured to the floor with a nonslip mat or anti-slip rug tape.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Ukraine&apos;s Kharkiv residents remain defiant as Russia launches new offensive</title>
                    
                    <description>Despite intense fighting in the Kharkiv region, residents of Ukraine&amp;apos;s second largest city, Kharkiv, have remained defiant. The city experienced a temporary respite on Sunday.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Residents &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;of Ukraine&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; second-biggest city, Kharkiv, remained defiant despite fierce fighting raging in the region after Russian forces launched an armored incursion on a new front that may presage a broader push into the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As battles raged in the north and east of the Kharkiv region, the city itself enjoyed a rare moment of calm on Sunday, May 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents took to the streets and parks of the city, walking, shopping, taking children to playgrounds. Many attended Sunday church services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/few-hundred-remain-vovchansk-russian-advance-intensifies-northeast-ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ONLY A FEW HUNDRED REMAIN IN VOVCHANSK AS RUSSIAN ADVANCE INTENSIFIES IN NORTHEAST UKRAINE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mood was upbeat, with most people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;saying Russia&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; incursion on the new front will not scare them to flee the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many said they trusted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ukrainian forces&lt;/a&gt; to push Russians away. Others said that despite months of relentless rocket, drone and artillery attacks on the city, they were determined to stay in their homes and hoped their children would grow up in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kharkiv&apos;s governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Saturday there was no imminent danger to the city of Kharkiv and no need to begin evacuating its roughly 1.3 million inhabitants. Kyiv officials have repeatedly said they do not believe Russia has the forces available to capture the city.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Trump, defenders show up in force ahead of Cohen testimony</title>
                    
                    <description>Former President Trump was flanked by Republican politicians and his legal team ahead of going into court Monday, when witness Michael Cohen is expected to deliver testimony.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Former President Trump&lt;/a&gt; was joined by a bevy of high-profile supporters Monday morning outside the Manhattan courtroom, where the NY v. Trump trial will hear from key witness Michael Cohen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Trump spoke to the media early Monday morning, Republican supporters such as Ohio Sen. JD Vance, New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, his son Eric Trump, and others were seen standing behind the 45th president for what is anticipated to be an action-packed day in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m proud to be in New York today to support my friend and president, Donald Trump. Americans see this case for what it is—a political circus. The left can lie about President Trump all they want, but the American people aren’t buying it,&quot; Tuberville said in comment provided to Fox News Digital on Monday morning.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s comments ahead of court Monday focused on his argument that the case is a &quot;baseless, politically motivated prosecution&quot; promoted by the Biden administration, while highlighting a recent poll showing him leading Biden in key battleground states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-cohens-credibility-issues-brazen-tiktok-usage-raise-media-eyebrows-ahead-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MICHAEL COHEN&apos;S CREDIBILITY ISSUES, BRAZEN TIKTOK USAGE RAISE MEDIA EYEBROWS AHEAD OF TESTIMONY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The New York Times just came out with a poll that shows us leading everywhere by a lot. This is the cover story. And I think you&apos;ll find it very interesting, but I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve all read it. Leading in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, Georgia and Nevada. Nevada, we are leading actually by 12 points, which is generally a Democrat state,&quot; Trump said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s 16th day on trial kicks off with testimony from his former personal attorney Michael Cohen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case revolves around the alleged falsification of business records. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Prosecutors say Cohen paid&lt;/a&gt; adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to quiet her claims of the alleged extramarital sexual encounter with Trump. Prosecutors allege the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen and fraudulently logged the payments as legal expenses, and are working to prove that Trump falsified records with the intent to commit or conceal a second crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has pleaded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;not guilty in the case&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniels took the stand last week, saying she met Trump in 2006 at Lake Tahoe during a celebrity golf tournament. She alleged that the pair had sex in Trump&apos;s hotel room during the event, which Trump has repeatedly denied in public comments. Daniels also described to the court how she got into the pornography business after working as an exotic dancer as a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal experts subsequently sounded off that Daniels’ testimony was irrelevant to the case and that some of her remarks should not have been admitted into the record. The Trump legal team twice motioned for a mistrial, but were denied by presiding Judge Juan Merchan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/may-13-trump-trial-michael-cohen-testimony&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MICHAEL COHEN EXPECTED TO TAKE THE STAND AS NY V. TRUMP TRIAL RESUMES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen has been slammed as a &quot;grifter&quot; by some critics in the lead-up to his testimony, and has been vocal in his condemnation of Trump after he no longer served as his attorney. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Trump 2024?&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/US/michael-cohen-cashing-trump-trial-tiktok-livestreams-problem/story?id=109695141&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cohen said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a TikTok video last month. &quot;More like Trump 20-24 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Judge Merchan called on New York prosecutors to instruct Cohen to stop making comments about the case and Trump ahead of taking the stand. Cohen, unlike Trump, is not under a gag order in the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/massive-trump-beach-rally-deep-blue-nj-draws-stark-contrast-bidens-beach-weekend-biden-could-never&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MASSIVE TRUMP BEACH RALLY IN DEEP-BLUE NJ DRAWS STARK CONTRAST TO BIDEN&apos;S BEACH WEEKEND: &apos;BIDEN COULD NEVER&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News contributor and constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley has called Cohen a &quot;serial perjurer&quot; who profits off the case, a sentiment that has been echoed by other legal experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Cohen has always been open as a grifter,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonathanturley.org/2024/05/09/michael-cohen-goes-on-tiktok-with-new-trump-taunt-and-announced-campaign-for-congress/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Turley recently wrote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jd-vance-slams-ny-v-trump-trial-dem-effort-distract-world-on-fire-under-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JD VANCE SLAMS NY V.

The problem is a political and legal system that enables him as a serial liar,&quot; Turley continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-supporters-flock-massive-new-jersey-campaign-rally-hear-former-president-speak-amid-ongoing-trials&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP SUPPORTERS FLOCK TO MASSIVE NEW JERSEY CAMPAIGN RALLY TO HEAR FORMER PRESIDENT SPEAK AMID ONGOING TRIALS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This week, convicted perjurer and disbarred attorney Michael Cohen will take a break from getting paid to trash Trump on TikTok – to trash Trump in the courtroom,&quot; attorney Mike Davis, who served as a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fox News Digital.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday&apos;s day in court follows Trump holding a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/elections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; massive rally in the historically deep blue state&lt;/a&gt; of New Jersey on Saturday, where the 45h president said &quot;over 100,000 people&quot; joined him on the beach in Wildwood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think we&apos;re probably leading in New Jersey. We had a rally – over a 100,000 people this weekend. A lot of the mainstream media didn&apos;t want to say how many people, they didn&apos;t want to cover. But in fact… I hear the big crowd was not shown by the mainstream media,&quot; Trump said Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Brian Flood and David Rutz contributed to this story. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Season 21 was a media circus for Perry as she at times was booed by fans.

                    <title>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle experience Nigerian dancing, fashion while visiting charities</title>
                    
                    <description>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry viewed traditional Nigerian dances and were gifted traditional garments while visiting Lagos, where they attended fundraisers and charity events.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nigeria’s fashion and traditional dances were on full display on Sunday as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/prince-harry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Prince Harry&lt;/a&gt; and Meghan arrived in its largest city, Lagos, as part of their three-day visit to the country to promote mental health for soldiers and empower young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple, invited to the West African nation by its military, were treated to different bouts of dancing, starting from the Lagos airport where a troupe&apos;s acrobatic moves left both applauding and grinning. One of the dancers, who looked younger than 5 years old, exchanged salutes with Harry from high up in the air, standing on firm shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going with Meghan’s white top was the traditional Nigerian aso oke, a patterned handwoven fabric wrapped around the waist and often reserved for special occasions. It was a gift from a group of women a day earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-stirs-controversy-during-nigeria-trip-wearing-dress-called-windsor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEGHAN MARKLE STIRS CONTROVERSY DURING NIGERIA TRIP BY WEARING DRESS CALLED &apos;WINDSOR&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-harry-meghan-markles-nigeria-visit-aims-keep-up-royal-image-expert-claims&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The couple&lt;/a&gt; visited a local charity – Giants of Africa — which uses basketball to empower young people. There, they were treated to another round of dancing before unveiling a partnership between the organization and their Archewell Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What you guys are doing here at Giants of Africa is truly amazing,&quot; Harry said of the group. &quot;The power of sport can change lives. It brings people together and creates community and there are no barriers, which is the most important thing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masai Ujiri, the charity’s president and an ex-NBA star, wished Meghan a happy Mother’s Day and acknowledged how hard it can be &quot;for us to be away from our kids and family to make things like this happen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To do so shows dedication (and) we truly appreciate it,&quot; he told the couple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news/meghan-markle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Meghan and Harry&lt;/a&gt; later attended a fundraiser for Nigeria’s soldiers wounded in the country’s fight against Islamic extremists and other armed groups in the country’s conflict-battered north. The event was related to Harry&apos;s Invictus Games, which Nigeria is seeking to host in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple were also hosted at the Lagos State Government House, where Meghan received another handwoven Nigerian fabric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’ve extended an additional invitation to them that they can always come back when they want to,&quot; Lagos Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Jessica Seinfeld, the wife of comedian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jerry-seinfeld-turns-70-comedian-reveals-darkening-moods-despite-monster-career&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jerry Seinfeld&lt;/a&gt;, praised her husband&apos;s &quot;amazing&quot; Duke University Class of 2024 commencement speech on Instagram over the weekend after a group of anti-Israel protesters tried to interrupt him but found themselves drowned out by the rest of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comic, who is Jewish and a co-chair of the university&apos;s Parents Committee, took the stage over the weekend to deliver remarks to a crowd of over 7,000 when the small demonstration broke out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few dozen protesters walked out of their seats, chanting &quot;Free Palestine&quot; along the way, videos of the incident show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Duke audience wouldn&apos;t have it, bursting out in chants of &quot;Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!&quot; and cheering for the comedian, video shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/duke-university-students-walk-jerry-seinfelds-commencement-speech-chant-free-palestine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DUKE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WALK OUT ON JERRY SEINFELD COMMENCEMENT SPEECH, CHANT ‘FREE PALESTINE’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Amazing crowd @dukeuniversity today where Jerry gave the commencement speech and received an honorary degree,&quot; Jessica Seinfeld wrote on her Instagram story. &quot;There was a minimal interruption – a small group of protesters walked out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They were booed by the crowd and then the stadium chanted ‘Jer-ry!’&quot; she added. &quot;Jerry&apos;s speech was amazing and the grads and their parents gave him a standing ovation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seinfeld received an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/college&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;honorary degree&lt;/a&gt; and delivered his speech without further interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university posted Seinfeld&apos;s full speech on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76QV2SrSqgo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;YouTube page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jerry-seinfeld-asks-howard-stern-forgiveness-after-suggesting-isnt-funny&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JERRY SEINFELD ASKS HOWARD STERN FOR FORGIVENESS AFTER SUGGESTING HE ISN&apos;T FUNNY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 16-minute clip, Seinfeld took a break from the jokes to give students his &quot;three real keys to life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No. 1, bust your a--,&quot; he said. &quot;No. 2, pay attention. No. 3, fall in love.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He urged the new grads to try hard and try again if they fail. Question risks and appreciate the small things in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also took a subtle swipe at wokeism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Privilege is a word that has taken quite a beating lately,&quot; he said. &quot;Privilege today seems to be the worst thing you can have. I would like to take a moment to defend it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up Jewish &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in New York&lt;/a&gt;, he said, was a privilege for an aspiring comedian. Graduating from Duke University is another privilege for the students attending his speech, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You went to Duke, that is an unbelievable privilege,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re embarrassed of things we should be proud of, and proud of things we should be embarrassed about.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You’re never going to believe this, Harvard used to be a great place to go to school,&quot; he joked. &quot;Now it&apos;s Duke.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/anti-israel-ivy-league-protests-have-prospective-students-looking-elsewhere-this-graduation-season&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Duke has emerged&lt;/a&gt; as a top U.S. university, attracting students who would be Ivy League contenders if they weren&apos;t turned off by the administrations&apos; handling of far-left campus protests, experts told Fox News Digital last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You cannot beat this school,&quot; Jessica Seinfeld concluded in her Instagram story. &quot;We are #ForeverDuke.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Philadelphia police are searching for several people they say were involved in attacking an off-duty police officer and stealing his personal firearm.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One man has been arrested and police in Philadelphia are still looking for a group of women allegedly involved in attacking an off-duty police officer and stealing his gun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assault and robbery of the officer&apos;s personal firearm happened around 7 a.m. Sunday in the 2100 block of West Oxford Street, police said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officer had disarmed his assailant while the two were engaged in a struggle and shot at him in self-defense, although it was unknown if the suspect was hit, authorities said. The officer was in the process of trying to detain his attacker when police say women interfered, allowing the man to get in a black BMW sedan and hit the officer with the vehicle while driving away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man accused in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;initial attack was arrested&lt;/a&gt; Sunday afternoon on G and Hilton streets, but the stolen firearm has not been recovered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/houston-transgender-suspect-runs-fatally-stabs-man-police&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOUSTON TRANSGENDER SUSPECT RUNS OVER, FATALLY STABS MAN: POLICE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police are now asking for the public&apos;s help identifying the women, and investigators are trying to identify multiple men for possible questioning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police officer&apos;s condition has not been released. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/video-shows-moments-deputies-fatally-shoot-man-armed-railroad-spike-florida-church&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIDEO SHOWS MOMENTS BEFORE DEPUTIES FATALLY SHOOT MAN ARMED WITH RAILROAD SPIKE AT FLORIDA CHURCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with information is asked to contact the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Philadelphia Police Department.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>What to expect from Putin as Russian strongman begins new six-year term</title>
                    
                    <description>Undeterred by the U.S.&amp;apos; unwavering support of Kyiv, Russia will likely ratchet up offensive operations against Ukraine and intensify non-kinetic confrontation with Washington.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; was inaugurated for another six-year term as president amid the worst crisis in Moscow’s relations with the West over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. During the traditionally ornate ceremony in the Kremlin, Putin called his compatriots a &quot;united and great nation&quot; and vowed to place Russia’s interests and security above anything else. Brimming with confidence, the Russian strongman punctuated his speech by declaring: &quot;Together we will overcome all obstacles. We will fulfill everything we have planned. Together we will win.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the top U.S. spy chief, DNI Avril Haines, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that the Russia-Ukraine war is &quot;unlikely to end anytime soon,&quot; warning that Putin’s &quot;aggressive tactics are likely to continue.&quot; That, despite the fact that Congress recently approved another multibillion-dollar military aid package for Ukraine to help it fight the Russians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is inside Putin’s mind at this time? Will the Russian dictator be deterred by our government’s unwavering commitment to fund Kyiv? What are his next steps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/as-someone-who-grew-up-soviet-russia-dont-let-america-turn-into-godless-nation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP IN SOVIET RUSSIA, DON&apos;T LET AMERICA TURN INTO A GODLESS NATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having examined Russia’s force posture, the state of the Russian military and economy, declared strategic goals and threat perceptions, here is what we can expect from Putin, whose thinking I’ve studied and analyzed in the course of my intelligence career. I will also note what Putin will probably not do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the Russian forces will highly likely initiate a major counteroffensive campaign in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;northeastern Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s possible that it could begin right after the Victory Day Parade, the national holiday celebrating Russia’s defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Aiming to capitalize on Ukraine’s shortages in manpower, combat hardware and ammunition, the Russians will seek to break through the front lines by or during this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make this happen, Moscow is preparing 100,000 troops to join the front lines, consistent with the decree signed by Putin in December directing the Ministry of Defense to increase the armed forces by 170,000 additional personnel to the maximum strength of 1,320,000 servicemen. Moscow is also increasing its defense spending by almost 70% in 2024 from 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin feels that the momentum is on Russia’s side theater wide, as Ukraine is outmanned and outgunned. This being said, he is almost certainly deeply concerned about a recent statement made by French President Emmanuel Macron to The Economist. Macron insinuated that he would send troops to Ukraine &quot;if the Russians were to break through the front lines, if there were a Ukrainian request.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aiming to deter NATO from deploying forces into the theater, Russia will hold military exercises involving tactical nuclear weapons. Putin personally ordered the drills to &quot;practice for the preparation and deployment for use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,&quot; according to Russia’s Ministry of Defense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Russia routinely conducts strategic nuclear exercises, announcing them in advance, the public declaration made by Moscow of non-strategic nuclear drills is unprecedented. It is intended as a strategic signaling to leaders in Washington and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/nato&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NATO commanders&lt;/a&gt; to stay out of what Russia considers its strategic security perimeter, of which Ukraine is part in Moscow’s view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Tuesday’s inauguration speech, Putin – almost certainly referring to Ukrainians living in the regions annexed by Moscow – thanked the &quot;citizens of Russia in all regions of our country, residents of our historical lands who defended the right to be together with the Motherland.&quot; Putin believes that Russia has a rightful claim to Ukraine its statehood originated from &quot;Kievan Rus,&quot; the land that is currently occupied by modern Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventy-seven percent of Russians support the actions of its military in Ukraine, effectively agreeing with Putin, according to the Levada Center. The same percentage of Russians believe that Russia will win the war. Levada is an independent polling agency designated by the Russian state as a &quot;foreign agent&quot; for expressing views that are unfavorable to the Russian government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/is-russias-putin-devout-christian-has-he-weaponized-religion-advance-personal-ambitions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IS RUSSIA’S PUTIN A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN OR HAS HE WEAPONIZED RELIGION TO ADVANCE HIS PERSONAL AMBITIONS?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, Russian intelligence services will likely ramp up their hunt for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/volodymyr-zelenskyy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to assassinate him. On Saturday, the Russian government added Zelenskyy to the list of wanted criminals. The Russian Interior Ministry justified the search warrant for the Ukrainian president by stating that is &quot;under an article of the criminal code.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelenskyy has been on the target list since the beginning of Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and has survived multiple assassination attempts. A day before Putin’s inauguration, Ukraine’s counterintelligence services reportedly disrupted a Russian covert operation aimed at infiltrating Zelenskyy’s security team and taking him hostage or killing him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has a targeted assassination program governed by the federal law, &quot;On Countering Extreme Activity,&quot; that was approved by Putin in 2002, two-and-a-half years after he assumed the presidency, and updated in 2006. This law already allows Russian intelligence services to &quot;eliminate (likvidirovat) Zelenskyy and other military and political leaders of Ukraine as ‘persons presenting a threat to the Russian state.’&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placing Zelenskyy on the &quot;wanted list&quot; sends a signal to Russian security services that capturing or killing him is a priority for the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russians will likely intensify their efforts to eliminate Zelenskyy on or after May 20, the day when his presidential term officially ends. Last November, Zelenskyy canceled the 2024 presidential election, arguing that Ukraine must concentrate all its resources on fighting Russia, which prompted Moscow to consider him illegitimate as the leader of Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, Russia will intensify its non-kinetic confrontation with Washington. While Russia fears a direct war with the U.S. and NATO, because of our superiority in conventional arms, it views the risk of the erosion of its strategic buffer zone, on which it relied for its security for centuries, even more. Washington’s continuous support provided to Ukraine has exacerbated Russia’s fears of a future conflict with NATO. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscow believes a direct kinetic U.S.-Russia war is &quot;inevitable&quot; in the long run. The Russian General Staff made this intelligence assessment based on the long-standing U.S. policy seeking to democratize Russia’s post-Soviet neighbors in Eurasia and Washington’s stated intentions to accept Ukraine into NATO, an adversarial alliance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, four Russian military aircraft breached the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), but didn’t enter U.S. airspace, according to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). Russia periodically flies strategic bombers close to our borders. These practice runs are intended to test our responses and to signal the readiness of the Russian military for a full-on war with the United States over control of the post-Soviet regions. Russian weapons systems are already capable of striking targets throughout the United States and Canada from stand-off distances – that is, without entering U.S. sovereign airspace to deliver the weapons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian intelligence services also will likely intensify their efforts to arrest U.S. citizens traveling to Russia in a effort to rattle &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Biden administration &lt;/a&gt;and to accumulate a list of candidates to trade with Washington for high-value Russian operatives held in U.S. prisons. On Tuesday, a U.S. Army soldier was detained in Vladivostok on charges of theft. Having had a number of prisoner swaps that Putin almost certainly feels were favorable to Russia, Moscow likely concluded that it can manipulate the Biden administration into giving up Russian assets valuable to Putin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, what Putin will not do is invade a NATO nation. Despite such claims made by Washington politicians, such a move would be suicidal for Putin as it would trigger NATO Article 5 Collective Defense. Putin is acutely aware of Russia’s conventional inferiority visa-a-vis NATO. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin routinely uses Russia’s nuclear trump card to intimidate the West and would likely authorize a tactical nuclear strike in the theater such as in Ukraine in certain scenarios, but those are high on the escalation ladder. But, as a rational actor, he would not intentionally pick a fight in which Russia would face the might of NATO’s entire war-fighting machine. Such a claim is illogical. It is also refuted by multiple assessments made by the U.S. intelligence community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2024 Annual Threat assessment reveals that &quot;Russia almost certainly does not want a direct military conflict with U.S. and NATO forces and will continue asymmetric activity below what it calculates to be the threshold of military conflict globally.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following excerpts from unclassified intelligence reports debunk the idea that Russia has the military and economic capacity to invade a NATO country, triggering a war with NATO: &quot;Russia has suffered more military losses than at any time since World War II – roughly 300,000 casualties and thousands of tanks and armored combat vehicles&quot; and &quot;Moscow&apos;s military forces will face a multi-year recovery after suffering extensive equipment and personnel losses during the Ukraine conflict.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same report reveals that &quot;the Russian military has and will continue to face issues of attrition, personnel shortages, and morale challenges.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/k/rebekah-koffler&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REBEKAH KOFFLER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
