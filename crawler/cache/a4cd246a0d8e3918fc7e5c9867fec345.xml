                    <title>10 wedding superstitions that date back decades but are still prevalent today</title>
                    
                    <description>Wedding days come with many timeless traditions and ancient superstitions. Some couples take superstitions to heart, while others worry less.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/weddings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;A wedding day&lt;/a&gt; is a magical event full of love, traditions and sometimes superstitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every wedding is unique to the couple who is celebrating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some weddings tend to be more traditional, while others take a more modern approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/wedding-planning-timeline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEWLY ENGAGED? USE THIS TIMELINE TO PLAN YOUR WEDDING FROM 12 MONTHS OUT TO THE BIG DAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many weddings do a little bit of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many different superstitions that are said to bring luck, both good and bad, to a couple. Here are just a few. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular wedding superstitions is that rain on a wedding day brings good luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/weather&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Less than ideal weather&lt;/a&gt; could strike at any time, so if you do see raindrops on your big day, this superstition is one worth believing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the brighter side of a rainy wedding, the showers do make for beautiful, romantic photos. While it may not seem ideal at the time, saying &quot;I do&quot; in a rainy setting is a unique memory you won’t forget. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/guide-spring-wedding-dress-shopping&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;brides wear beautiful veils&lt;/a&gt; as part of their wedding attire, but brides used to wear them with protection as the purpose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/diy-wedding-guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAVE MONEY ON YOUR WEDDING WITH THIS DIY GUIDE &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/greek-wedding-traditions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;originated with the ancient Greeks&lt;/a&gt; and Romans, who believed a veil protected a bride from evil spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A popular superstition is that a bride must wear &quot;something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue&quot; on her wedding day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these things serves a very specific purpose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something old represents the past, while something new represents the future. It’s believed that when a bride wears something borrowed from a married woman, the luck of her marriage will be transferred. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something blue represents &quot;fidelity and love’s purity,&quot; according to the Brides website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last part of the rhyme that is often forgotten is a sixpence in your shoe. Historically, the father of the bride would put a sixpence in his daughter’s shoe as a sign of good luck and prosperity, according to Brides.com. Today, if a couple believes in this superstition, they often go with a penny instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One common tradition at weddings today is the bouquet toss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/wedding-photographer-tips-dos-donts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIPS FROM AN EXPERT WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER FOR YOUR BIG DAY &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a wedding reception, the single ladies will all stand together, while the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/budget-wedding-florals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;bride tosses her bouquet&lt;/a&gt; in their direction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lucky lady who catches the bouquet is said to be the next to marry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bouquet toss is quite a competition at some weddings. Be careful, or you might catch an elbow in the eye. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday is the most popular day of the week to get married, and it’s not hard to guess why. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as scheduling goes, many people have Saturdays and Sundays off from work, so a Saturday wedding doesn’t require them to take time off, and they can enjoy the following day off too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, a wedding superstition is that Saturdays are actually the worst day to get married. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This superstition originates from an old Celtic poem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Monday for abundance, Tuesday for wellness, Wednesday is the greatest day of all, Thursday for the losses, Friday for wedding crosses, and Saturday for no luck at all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you see a spider on your wedding dress, don’t be afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is actually thought to be a sign of good luck, according to an old English tradition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many years, it has been thought as bad luck for a groom to see his bride before the ceremony. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tradition of the couple not seeing each other before the ceremony is one that has evolved in more modern times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many couples still choose to stick with this tradition and wait until the ceremony to see each other for the first time. Others have opted for the more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/wedding-first-looks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;modern first look.&lt;/a&gt; With a first look, a bride and groom meet at a designated place before the ceremony to see each other for the very first time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the bride and groom will share their vows privately with each other at this moment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of these ways are still popular at weddings today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Items for the house are a common &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/wedding-gift-guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;gift on wedding registries,&lt;/a&gt; but if you are a superstitious bride, maybe refrain from putting knives on the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancient legend suggests that knives symbolize breaking a relationship. So, maybe ask for pots and pans instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are typically a lot of tears shed at a wedding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don’t worry, tears are a good thing. The superstition is that a bride crying at her wedding means all her tears have been shed and a happy marriage lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, don’t be afraid to shed a few tears throughout the day, so long as it doesn’t ruin your makeup, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon-to-be brides are often excited about taking their future husband&apos;s name and may start using it before the wedding day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a superstition that using your future spouse&apos;s last name too soon will prevent the wedding from happening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Bill Maher calls for COVID Commission: The &apos;powers that be&apos; refuse to admit they &apos;got it wrong&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>HBO&amp;apos;s Bill Maher called for a &amp;quot;COVID Commission&amp;quot; to be established after calling out the &amp;quot;powers that be&amp;quot; who refuse to acknowledged they botched the pandemic.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Real Time&quot; host &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-vows-everything-can-make-sure-trump-loses-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Bill Maher&lt;/a&gt; closed his show Friday night by calling for a &quot;COVID Commission&quot; to investigate how the country mishandled the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I get it that we didn&apos;t know exactly what was happening at the beginning of COVID and some mistakes were inevitable,&quot; Maher told his audience. &quot;But four years on, I&apos;m tired of hearing &apos;Well, we didn&apos;t know.&apos; No, we didn&apos;t. But some people guessed better than others. And the people who got it wrong don&apos;t seem to want to acknowledge that now.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some people said closing schools for so long was pointless and would cause much worse collateral damage to kids and they were right,&quot; Maher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-panics-trumps-gain-young-voters-biden-might-lose-because-hot-dogs-cost-more&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BILL MAHER PANICS OVER TRUMP&apos;S GAIN WITH YOUNG VOTERS: BIDEN MIGHT LOSE ‘BECAUSE HOT DOGS COST MORE’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maher took aim at The Daily Beast for a hit piece it ran on him in 2021 for considering the lab-leak theory, running the headline &quot;Bill Maher pushes Steve Bannon Wuhan lab conspiracy theory,&quot; something he noted was &quot;typical of the mainstream media at the time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;Of course, it wasn&apos;t a conspiracy theory, and it wasn&apos;t owned by Steve Bannon. And now everyone, including the Biden administration, admits there&apos;s at least a 50-50 chance that the virus could have begun in the lab in Wuhan that was doing gain of function research on that virus, duh! But I don&apos;t see a lot of retractions being printed,&quot; Maher said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-rips-dems-pandering-minority-voters-move-identity-politics-not-working&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BILL MAHER RIPS DEMS ‘PANDERING’ TO MINORITY VOTERS: ‘MOVE ON FROM IDENTITY POLITICS. IT’S NOT WORKING&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HBO host blasted the claim years back that natural immunity was inferior to the COVID vaccine and listed several &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;COVID-era overreactions&lt;/a&gt; like washing the mail and wearing masks outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Because the last thing you would want to do when a disease is afoot is get fresh air and sunshine and vitamin D,&quot; Maher sarcastically said. &quot;No, much better to stay locked up, stressed out and day drinking.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, some very bad ideas were embraced as the conventional wisdom, ideas that haven&apos;t aged well. And a lot of its dissenting opinions that were suppressed and ridiculed at the time have proven to be correct,&quot; Maher said. &quot;Maybe that&apos;s why the powers that be never wanted a COVID commission. Why not? We love commissions! The Warren Commission, the AIDS Commission, 911 Commission. The NFL even had an &apos;Is ramming your head into another guy&apos;s head bad for heads?&apos; Commission.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-john-cleese-rail-new-york-times-sad-no-longer-great-newspaper&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BILL MAHER, JOHN CLEESE RAIL AGAINST THE NEW YORK TIMES: ‘SAD’ IT&apos;S NO LONGER A ‘GREAT NEWSPAPER’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So where&apos;s the COVID commission? Because it seems to me we haven&apos;t learned a thing. Maybe the number one lesson from the pandemic was the need for proper air ventilation, second was never go on a Zoom with Jeffrey Toobin,&quot; Maher quipped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But if there&apos;s been a big national to retrofit buildings, I missed it. Gain of function research is still going on in labs. We&apos;re still torturing animals by raising our food in conditions ideal for viruses to make the leap to humans… We handed out $4 trillion dollars of free money, 280 billion of which was just flat-out stolen in what the AP called ‘the greatest grift in US history’ and which started an inflationary spiral that we now blame on Biden. So we&apos;re gonna &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;bring back Trump&lt;/a&gt;?! The guy who ignored COVID like it was the dinner check?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Talk about not learning anything,&quot; Maher added.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>US voters want more border patrol agents, less asylum seekers allowed: poll</title>
                    
                    <description>An Associated Press-NORC poll released this week suggests voters across party lines see illegal immigration as one of the most important issues in the U.S. and want tighter border security.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Voters in the United States are increasingly supportive of policies meant to address the ongoing illegal immigration crisis at the border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press, in partnership with the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, polled U.S. voters on key policy proposals to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/border-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;curb illegal border crossings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase to the number of border patrol officers was by far the most popular policy proposal. Approximately 79% of Republicans, 54% of Democrats and 56% of independents stated they were in favor, according to the poll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/dhs-failure-file-paperwork-200k-immigration-court-cases-tossed-president-biden-trac&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DHS&apos; FAILURE TO FILE PAPERWORK HAS LED TO 200K IMMIGRATION COURT CASES TOSSED UNDER PRESIDENT BIDEN: TRAC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 53% of respondents said they would like to &quot;reduce the number of immigrants who are allowed to seek asylum in the United States when they arrive at the U.S. border.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 24% opposed the sentiment — an additional 23% neither favored nor opposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suggestion of building a border wall to prevent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;illegal immigration&lt;/a&gt; was the least popular, with only 42% of adults polled saying they supported the idea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/sheriff-slams-biden-abandoning-texas-border-no-longer-us-mexico-border-us-world-border&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHERIFF SLAMS BIDEN FOR ABANDONING TEXAS ON BORDER: ‘NO LONGER US-MEXICO BORDER, BUT US WORLD-BORDER’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/border-wall&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;border wall&lt;/a&gt; is drastically skewed along party lines, with 79% of Republicans in favor and only 12% of Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 40% of independents support a border wall being constructed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poll shows immigration remains an extremely important concern for voters across party lines, regardless of preferred policy solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 75% of Republicans said immigration was &quot;extremely or very important,&quot; as well as 52% of Independents and 46% of Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll was conducted between Mar. 21 and Mar. 25 and surveyed 1,282 adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.8%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>5 things you should not do during a traffic stop</title>
                    
                    <description>If you get pulled over by a police officer, stay calm throughout your interaction. Avoid doing these five things when you get stopped on the road.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When you&apos;re driving and see emergency lights behind you on the road, the most important thing to remember is to stay calm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s normal to feel instant stress when you’re getting pulled over — but staying calm can make for a smoother interaction between you and law enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of reasons that you may get pulled over, and the reason may or may not be clear to you from the start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/car-submerged-water-what-to-do&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BALTIMORE BRIDGE COLLAPSE: WHAT TO DO IF YOUR CAR IS SUBMERGED IN WATER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common reasons for getting pulled over include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a traffic violation,&lt;/a&gt; being on your phone while driving or an issue with your vehicle that you may not have known about or realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you ever do find yourself getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;pulled over by law enforcement,&lt;/a&gt; here are five things you &lt;i&gt;should not&lt;/i&gt; do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as you see a law enforcement official attempt to stop you while you’re on the road, pull over immediately but safely.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/interview-questions-trouble&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AVOID ASKING THESE QUESTIONS WHEN CONDUCTING AN INTERVIEW; THEY COULD GET YOU INTO TROUBLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you see the emergency lights flashing behind you, use your turn signal and pull over as soon as it is safe to do so, the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) website says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get pulled over, remain seated and wait for further instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/social-media-legal-trouble&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BE CAREFUL OF WHAT YOU ARE POSTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA BECAUSE THESE 6 THINGS COULD GET YOU INTO TROUBLE &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you are safely stopped, the AAMVA suggests staying seated unless you are directed by an officer to exit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are pulled over at night, turn on your interior lights while you wait for the officer to arrive at your window to help with visibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, no matter what time of day it is, shut off any audio you have playing in the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you wait for the officer to arrive beside your car, stay seated inside the car and stay calm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are pulled over, keep your hands where the officer can see them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best place to keep your hands during a traffic stop is on the steering wheel so they&apos;re visible to the officer, the AAMVA says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t start searching around for anything in your car. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/auto&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;license and insurance&lt;/a&gt; are out of reach, let the officer know where they are and wait for the officer&apos;s acknowledgment before reaching for them, the AAMVA says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaching around your car could potentially draw suspicion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it’s best to keep your hands where they can see them at all times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you get pulled over, becoming nervous is a natural reaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, take deep breaths, stay as calm as possible and follow the instructions given to you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you roll down your window to speak with the police officer, let the officer start talking first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t argue. Be compliant with the requests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be argumentative, lie or give any false information or documentation to the police officer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A truck driver was arrested Friday and charged with criminally negligent homicide in connection to a March 22 school bus collision &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Texas&lt;/a&gt; that left a man and a boy dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jerry Hernandez, 42, was arrested without incident at a residence in Bastrop County, said Sgt. Deon Cockrell of the Texas Department of Public Safety, according to The Associated Press. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His bond is currently set at $500,000, per the Bastrop County Jail. Hernandez does not yet have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/in-court&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;an attorney.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/dashcam-video-shows-cement-truck-plowing-texas-school-bus-killing-boy-man&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DASHCAM VIDEO SHOWS CEMENT TRUCK PLOWING INTO TEXAS SCHOOL BUS, KILLING BOY AND MAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas police reportedly interviewed Hernandez last week while he was in a hospital for treatment, KVUE reported, citing court documents. Hernandez reportedly admitted to having smoked marijuana the night before the crash.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hernandez also allegedly told police he had only slept about three hours before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/drug-and-substance-abuse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consuming cocaine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at 1 a.m. on the morning of March 22. He also refused to provide a blood sample for analysis, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-school-bus-returning-field-trip-crashes-killing-least-two&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEXAS SCHOOL BUS RETURNING FROM FIELD TRIP CRASHES, KILLING MAN AND BOY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deadly collision took place around 2 p.m. near Texas State Highway 21 and Caldwell Road in Bastrop County, a rural highway outside Austin, according to FOX Austin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The school bus&lt;/a&gt; was carrying more than 40 pre-K students from Tom Green Elementary School who were returning from a zoo field trip. The bus was carrying 11 adults as well as children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crash ultimately killed 5-year-old Ulises Rodriguez Montoya, who was on the bus, as well as Ryan Wallace, 33, who was driving in another vehicle close by that was hit by the truck. Wallace was a doctoral student at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/college&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the University of Texas,&lt;/a&gt; according to the Austin American-Statesman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/driver-dead-fiery-crash-new-york-school-bus-returning-field-trip-video&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DRIVER DIES IN FIERY CRASH WITH NEW YORK SCHOOL BUS RETURNING FROM FIELD TRIP: VIDEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four individuals were airlifted from the site in critical condition following the crash. Six others with serious injuries were taken by ambulance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to hospitals.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video released by the Hays Consolidated Independent School District showed other drivers leaving their cars to race toward the bus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crash remains under investigation and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;authorities have not&lt;/a&gt; yet said how fast the vehicles were driving at the time of the collision. The school district stated the bus did not have seatbelts, per The Associated Press. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Michael Dorgan and The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Holy Saturday, the day immediately after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/christianity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt; was put to death on Good Friday and before His resurrection on Easter Sunday, is not just a day of sadness, but also a reminder of God&apos;s promises, a pastor told Fox News Digital.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Holy Saturday is a day of somber reflection and profound hope,&quot; said Pastor Jesse Bradley of Auburn, Washington. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bradley is an author and pastor of Grace Community Church outside Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/easter-god-love-should-not-be-domesticated-bishop-robert-barron&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EASTER IS ABOUT GOD&apos;S LOVE AND SHOULD NOT BE ‘DOMESTICATED,’ SAYS BISHOP ROBERT BARRON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jesus died for our sins, so that we can live. The chief priests and Pharisees knew that Jesus clearly stated that He would rise from the dead on the third day,&quot; Bradley told Fox News Digital, referencing John 2:19-21. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At their request, Roman soldiers were sent to guard the tomb — and it was secured so that nobody could steal Christ&apos;s body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Jesus Christ rose from the dead on Easter Sunday, in spite of the guards and sealed tomb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Holy Saturday reminds us that no one can stop &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Lord or His promises&lt;/a&gt;. In every generation, there will be doubters, mockers, scoffers and opposition,&quot; said Bradley. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;God has the final say, however — and His good plans cannot be thwarted.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/coming-easter-means-salvation-humanity-hand-seminary-president&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE COMING EASTER MEANS THE SALVATION OF HUMANITY IS AT HAND: SEMINARY PRESIDENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Holy Saturday marks a time to &quot;remember the love and sacrifice of Jesus,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We humble ourselves and turn from sin. We wait on the Lord. Jesus experienced betrayal, injustice, persecution, physical pain, abandonment and death. We do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with us or understand our struggles. We have One who suffered and who cares about us,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/holy-week-leads-faithful-easter-sunday-special-days-observed-what-they-mean&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HOLY WEEK LEADS THE FAITHFUL TO EASTER SUNDAY: HERE ARE THE SPECIAL DAYS OBSERVED AND WHAT THEY MEAN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Holy Saturday, Christians are reminded that &quot;our trials will pass — and we are not alone. God is still with us. God still has a plan. God will provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/good-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sustaining grace&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We grieve deeply, but our hope is greater still. This light and momentary mourning is bearable when compared to the surpassing glory and joy of an eternity that far outweighs our afflictions,&quot; said Bradley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Holy Saturday may be bleak, the knowledge of Christ&apos;s resurrection on Easter Sunday serves as a reassurance that &quot;the promises of God stand firm,&quot; said Bradley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/easter-bunny-teaches-kids-true-meaning-easter-book-faith-focus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EASTER BUNNY TEACHES KIDS &apos;TRUE MEANING&apos; OF EASTER IN NEW BOOK WITH FAITH FOCUS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/faith&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;faith is ultimately&lt;/a&gt; based on facts, not feelings,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you are in a season of life that feels like Holy Saturday, you can cultivate habits that provide hope,&quot; said Bradley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those habits can include reading the Bible, finding a community of faith and serving others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The healing process takes time, but when you are loved, restoration becomes a reality,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when a person feels down or spiritually empty, that person should strive to serve others, as &quot;unselfishness brings life to all.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/jesus-farewell-discourse-is-reminder-christians-never-alone-california-professor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;JESUS&apos; FAREWELL DISCOURSE IS A REMINDER THAT CHRISTIANS ARE NEVER ALONE, SAYS CALIFORNIA PROFESSOR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The women had prepared spices on Saturday and went to the tomb on Sunday and found the stone was rolled away,&quot; said Bradley, referring to Luke 24:1-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those women &quot;continued to love God and do what they could, even before the miracle happened,&quot; and even after Christ had been brutally executed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God, said Bradley, will reward those who continue to be steadfast in their faith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Holy Saturday is a time to pause, thank Jesus, be still, trust God’s Word, wait on God, and just choose hope — because we know that Sunday is coming,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Aircraft in Baltic region hit by GPS jamming as some blame Russia</title>
                    
                    <description>There has been a sharp uptick in the number of missing or fake Global Positioning System (GPS) signals known as jamming in aircraft in the Baltic region Russia being blamed by some experts.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aircraft flying over the Baltic region have reported a mysterious increase in the number of missing or fake Global Positioning System (GPS) signals with concerns being raised &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;that Russia&lt;/a&gt; is to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 1,600 aircraft, including civilian aircraft, experienced the interference — known as GPS jamming — in less than two days earlier this week, according to an open-source intelligence account that regularly tracks GPS interference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jamming seems to be concentrated around Russia&apos;s Kaliningrad exclave — a key military area for Moscow. It is situated between NATO members Poland and Lithuania and serves as a base for one of Russia&apos;s major naval fleets. GPS jamming has been occurring regularly since the start of the war &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/putins-nuke-threat-endangers-some-americas-coolest-technology&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PUTIN’S NUKE THREAT ENDANGERS SOME OF AMERICA’S COOLEST TECHNOLOGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) tells Politico that it is looking into the issue, but so far regulators say that the GPS problems are not a danger to flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interference cases reported by pilots &quot;have been increasing steadily since January 2022,&quot; the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) tells the publication. The travel safety agency received reports from pilots through its voluntary incident reporting system EVAIR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organization says it received 985 GPS outages during January and February this year compared to 1,371 for all of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia is understood to have significant electronic warfare (EW) resources in Kaliningrad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/united-flight-diverted-medical-emergency-multiple-passengers-treated&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNITED FLIGHT DIVERTED DUE TO MEDICAL EMERGENCY, MULTIPLE PASSENGERS TREATED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Russian armed forces have a wide spectrum of military equipment dedicated for GNSS interference, including jamming and spoofing, at varying distances, duration and intensity,&quot; a Lithuanian defense official told Newsweek earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dana Goward, president of the U.S.-based Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation, tells Politico that Russia regularly targets aircraft with the technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is a real threat. There is one instance of accidentally jamming we know of that almost resulted in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/airlines&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;passenger aircraft&lt;/a&gt; impacting a mountain,&quot; he said, referring to a case reported by NASA in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-March, a military plane carrying British Defense Secretary Grant Shapps was hit by GPS jamming on its way back from Poland, although EASA hasn&apos;t been able to confirm the Russian origin of the interference or whether the jamming is intentional, Politico reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022 and 2023, EASA, warned about an increase in reports of GPS spoofing and jamming incidents taking place in areas surrounding Russia, including in Finland, around the Black Sea and in the Baltic Sea area, according to the Wall Street Journal. In one bulletin, EASA said pilots were forced to reroute planes or change their destinations midflight.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aircraft are still able to fly safely without GPS and can switch to other sources when GPS is inaccurate, experts say. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>NBC&apos;s Ronna McDaniel meltdown: Falsehoods and debunked narratives MSNBC promoted on its &apos;sacred airwaves&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>MSNBC stars pushed out Ronna McDaniel from their &amp;quot;sacred airwaves,&amp;quot; which has featured such narratives as Trump-Russia collusion and Hunter Biden&amp;apos;s laptop being disinformation.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-stars-shoot-inside-tent-attack-nbc-hiring-ex-rnc-chair-ronna-mcdaniel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;A mob at MSNBC&lt;/a&gt; got its wishes this week and helped ensure new colleague Ronna McDaniel would be ousted from the network. NBC announced just days ago that the former RNC chair would be joining as a political analyst, but within four days, McDaniel was sent packing after an on-air outcry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the various diatribes against McDaniel, she was characterized as dishonest and labeled an &quot;election denier&quot; over her actions on behalf of former President Trump over his claims of a rigged 2020 race, as well as her own remarks that it was unfair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One MSNBC host suggested McDaniel wasn&apos;t worthy of the network&apos;s &quot;sacred airwaves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/nbcs-ousting-ronna-mcdaniel-reinforces-status-anti-trump-pro-biden-network&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NBC&apos;S OUSTING OF RONNA MCDANIEL REINFORCES STATUS AS ANTI-TRUMP, PRO-BIDEN NETWORK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;NBC News, either wittingly or unwittingly, is teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections, which Ronna McDaniel did on yesterday&apos;s ‘Meet the Press’… and they can do that as one of us, as badge-carrying employees of NBC News, as paid contributors to our sacred airwaves,&quot; Nicolle Wallace said on Monday&apos;s &quot;Deadline: White House.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except prominent MSNBC figures have repeatedly committed the exact sin they persecuted McDaniel for over, and over, and over again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are some of MSNBC&apos;s most memorable falsehoods that have appeared on its &quot;sacred airwaves.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the Trump presidency was plagued by the Russia collusion narrative that ultimately withered on the vine. Stemming from allegations peddled behind the scenes by the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016, the narrative that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin to win the election snowballed into a years-long investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose report concluded there was no evidence of a conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for more than two years, MSNBC became the go-to network for the anti-Trump Resistance to gobble up the Trump-Russia narrative. And no one at the network personified the media&apos;s Russia obsession more than its biggest star, Rachel Maddow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What’s getting to be, I think, particularly unsettling, is that simultaneously, we are… number one, nailing down more direct connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government at the time the Russian government was influencing our election,&quot; Maddow said back in March 2017. &quot;Number two, at the same time, we are also starting to see what may be signs of continuing influence in our country. Not just during the campaign but during the administration. Basically, signs of what could be a continuing operation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As The Washington Post&apos;s Erik Wemple &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/12/26/rachel-maddow-rooted-steele-dossier-be-true-then-it-fell-apart/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, Maddow heavily legitimized the widely discredited Christopher Steele dossier, which was at the center of the Mueller probe and contained the most salacious allegations tying then-President Trump and his orbit to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Republican[s] claim today was that the dossier has been increasingly discredited. That’s not true in terms of the public record about the dossier. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. As time goes on, more and more pieces do get independently corroborated,&quot; Maddow said in May 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maddow was hardly the only MSNBC host to boost the dossier, with others such as Nicolle Wallace and Chris Hayes also touting it or at least claiming it was not &quot;disproven.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The dossier on its face is still considered an unverified document compiled by British Intelligence officer Christopher Steele based on raw Intelligence. To date, none of it has been disproven, and whole big parts of it are holding up,&quot; Wallace said in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/discredited-anti-trump-steele-dossier-five-biggest-offenders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCREDITED ANTI-TRUMP STEELE DOSSIER WAS EMBRACED BY LIBERAL MEDIA: HERE ARE FIVE OF THE BIGGEST OFFENDERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the vast majority of legacy news organizations, MSNBC was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/hunter-biden-coverage-liberal-media-smear-campaign-russian-disinformation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;quick to dismiss the bombshell revelations&lt;/a&gt; of Hunter Biden&apos;s laptop during the 2020 election as &quot;Russian disinformation.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Morning Joe&quot; co-host Joe Scarborough declared the story &quot;false&quot; and later claimed it was &quot;so obviously&quot; Russian disinformation, asking, &quot;Why are we spreading the lies here?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-host Mika Brzezinski cited multiple reports about intelligence agencies investigating Rudy Giuliani&apos;s dealings with &quot;alleged Russian agents,&quot; as well as whether emails from Hunter Biden&apos;s laptop are &quot;linked to a foreign intel operation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicolle Wallace was more confident in dismissing Hunter Biden&apos;s laptop, telling viewers, &quot;We shouldn&apos;t look at it as anything other than a Russian disinformation operation.&quot; MSNBC anchor Katy Tur mocked the Post&apos;s story, saying it &quot;dropped like a bomb,&quot; but to &quot;wither under scrutiny, not really dropping like a bomb.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle attacked those who were covering the Hunter Biden controversy, referring to it as a &quot;so-called story&quot; with &quot;unverified claims.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, two MSNBC contributors, former CIA Director John Brennan and former CIA and Defense chief of staff Jeremy Bash, signed the infamous open letter from former intel officials pushing the Russian disinformation narrative, which was later promoted by a pre-MSNBC Jen Psaki on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&apos;t until May 2022 that NBC News &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/nbc-news-verifies-hunter-biden-laptop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;verified the authenticity of the laptop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSNBC jumped on the bandwagon in automatically believing disgraced actor Jussie Smollett, who staged his own hate crime in the dead of night during Chicago&apos;s historic polar vortex in January 2019. He alleged that two Trump supporters donning red Make America Great Again hats assaulted him and hurled racist and homophobic slurs at the &quot;Empire&quot; star shouting &quot;This is MAGA country!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was later revealed that he had hired two Nigerian brothers to orchestrate the attack. Smollett was convicted of disorderly conduct in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Smollett first came forward with the hoax, an emotional Ruhle called it a &quot;horrible story.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It gets worse,&quot; Ruhle told viewers at the time. &quot;One of the offenders wrapped a rope around Smollett&apos;s neck.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBC News correspondent Steve Patterson appeared on MSNBC, calling the not-real crimes committed against Smollett w&quot;just as heinous as you might imagine.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/the-five-liberal-media-smollett&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘THE FIVE’ ON LIBERAL MEDIA&apos;S RUSH TO JUDGMENT ON SMOLLETT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hoax from 2019 involved the smear campaign leveled at a group of students from Kentucky&apos;s Covington Catholic High School who had visited Washington D.C. for the annual March for Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A video had gone viral showing one &quot;MAGA&quot; hat-wearing student, Nicholas Sandmann, smiling at Native American elder Nathan Phillips beating a drum and singing a chant as he was surrounded by Sandmann&apos;s peers, who all had joined in on the chant in front of the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, several media outlets, including NBC, portrayed the incident with Sandmann and the other teens as being racially charged before it was discovered by additional footage that a group of Black Hebrew Israelites had provoked the confrontation by slinging racial slurs at the students as they were waiting for their bus. Footage then showed Phillips, who was in town for the Indigenous Peoples March, approaching the students amid the rising tension between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/nicholas-sandmann-nbc-settlement-covington-kid&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NICHOLAS SANDMANN REACHES SETTLEMENT WITH NBC IN COVINGTON CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL CONTROVERSY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the weekend edition of &quot;NBC Nightly News,&quot; NBC News&apos; José Díaz-Balart called it a &quot;troubling scene many are calling racist.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;Some students harassing an older Native American, of yet a Vietnam vet in the midst of a special ceremony,&quot; Díaz-Balart told viewers. Later in the report, NBC News correspondent Tammy Leitner said &quot;Tonight some wondering how this peaceful rally became a sad display of disrespect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBC&apos;s Savannah Guthrie was accused of &quot;interrogating&quot; Sandmann in an interview, asking him if he owed &quot;anyone an apology&quot; and whether he had any &quot;fault&quot; and following with other questions insinuating he was the aggressor. Meanwhile, Guthrie allowed Phillips to repeatedly attack Sandmann in a separate interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On MSNBC, fill-in anchor Peter Alexander said &quot;there certainly was taunting by some young men… to a Native American.&quot; Other anchors like Craig Melvin and Hallie Jackson similarly said the video showed the teens &quot;appearing to taunt&quot; Phillips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandmann filed a whopping $275 million defamation suit against NBC. The network made a settlement in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 2020 unrest in Kenosha, Wis., following the police-involved shooting of Jacob Blake, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse fatally shot two people and injured a third person while acting in self-defense. He was later found not guilty following a dramatic trial that received national attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite what a jury concluded, MSNBC found him guilty right from the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSNBC contributor Jason Johnson compared Rittenhouse to a &quot;school shooter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He&apos;s a 17-year-old kid! He shouldn&apos;t have had a gun. He crossed state lines to supposedly protect property? No. He was going out to shoot people,&quot; Johnson exclaimed. &quot;Kyle Rittenhouse is the enemy!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/kyle-rittenhouse-acquittal-liberal-media-fumes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KYLE RITTENHOUSE ACQUITTAL: LIBERAL MEDIA FUMES OVER VERDICT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellow contributor John Heilemann said Rittenhouse was &quot;arguably a domestic terrorist,&quot; claiming he crossed state lines &quot;with the intent to shoot people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several MSNBC hosts including Reid, Wallace and O&apos;Donnell referred to Rittenhouse as a &quot;vigilante.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest controversies of 2021 was the false narrative that Border Patrol agents were &quot;whipping&quot; Haitian migrants at the southern border. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images had gone viral of horseback border agents in Del Rio, Texas, showing them using what critics had thought were &quot;whips&quot; to attack Haitians attempting to enter the U.S. when in reality law enforcement was only equipped with reins to control their horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the false narrative was even accepted early on by the Biden administration, several MSNBC personalities also took turns magnifying it, including &quot;All In&quot; host Chris Hayes, who shared the images peddling the &quot;whip&quot; claims online. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/border-patrol-agents-whips-haitian-migrants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEDIA PEDDLES NARRATIVE HORSEBACK BORDER PATROL AGENTS USING ‘WHIPS’ ON HAITAN MIGRANTS IN DEL RIO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On MSNBC, NBC News correspondent Yamiche Alcindor accused the border agents of &quot;using reins against migrants, citing critics of the Biden administration who say it &quot;looks like slavery&quot; and call the treatment &quot;cruel&quot; and &quot;inhumane.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chuck Todd, who at the time was hosting &quot;MTP Daily,&quot; said border agents were &quot;using some kind of whips around migrants at the border.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the biggest promoter of the narrative was Joy Reid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is beyond repulsive. Are these images from 2021 or 1851??&quot; Reid posted online in reaction to the images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also peddled the lie on her show, saying on-air &quot;I was not aware that whips, which come from the slave era- slavery era were part of package that we issue any sort of law enforcement.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, then-White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki advanced the falsehood at the press briefing, calling the images &quot;obviously horrific.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don’t think anyone seeing that footage would think it’s acceptable or appropriate,&quot; Psaki told reporters at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the strangest story that made it to MSNBC&apos;s &quot;sacred airwaves&quot; was one that came from inside the house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, it was unearthed that Joy Reid had written a series of homophobic blog posts from 2007-2009, years before she became an MSNBC darling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, Reid took ownership of her past rhetoric and issued an apology, saying &quot;At no time have I intentionally sought to demean or harm the LGBT community, which includes people whom I deeply love…. Re-reading those old blog posts, I am disappointed in myself. I apologize to those who also are disappointed in me. Life can be humbling. It often is. But I hope that you know where my heart is, and that I will always strive to use my words for good. I know better and I will do better.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months later, after more offensive content from the old blog had surfaced, Reid alleged that the material published was actually &quot;fabricated.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/msnbc-star-joy-reids-claim-that-hackers-planted-homophobic-slurs-falls-apart-under-scrutiny&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MSNBC STAR JOY REID&apos;S CLAIM THAT HACKERS PLANTED HOMOPHOBIC SLURS FALLS APART UPON SCRUTINY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In December I learned that an unknown, external party accessed and manipulated material from my now-defunct blog, The Reid Report, to include offensive and hateful references that are fabricated and run counter to my personal beliefs and ideology,&quot; Reid had said in a statement. &quot;I began working with a cyber-security expert who first identified the unauthorized activity, and we notified federal law enforcement officials of the breach. The manipulated material seems to be part of an effort to taint my character with false information by distorting a blog that ended a decade ago.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now that the site has been compromised I can state unequivocally that it does not represent the original entries. I hope that whoever corrupted the site recognizes the pain they have caused, not just to me, but to my family and communities that I care deeply about: LGBTQ, immigrants, people of color and other marginalized groups,&quot; Reid added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, NBC quietly circulated a memo from Reid&apos;s &quot;security expert&quot; who concluded the blog &quot;was breached after a review of suspicious activity&quot; without providing evidence. Meanwhile, the Internet archiving website The Wayback Machine which had preserved Reid&apos;s old blog posts said it found nothing to indicate tampering or hacking of the Wayback Machine versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid doubled down on her blatant falsehood during an on-air address on her MSNBC show while still issuing an apology to the LGBTQ community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I genuinely do not believe I wrote those hateful things because they are completely alien to me,&quot; Reid told viewers in April 2018. &quot;But I can definitely understand based on things I have tweeted and have written in the past why some people don&apos;t believe me. I have not been exempt from being dumb or cruel or hurtful to the very people I want to advocate for. I own that. I get it. And for that, I&apos;m truly, truly sorry.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid was never reprimanded and is now one of the faces of the network&apos;s political coverage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A Georgia mother accused of attempting to kill her daughter&amp;apos;s sexual abuser was found guilty of murder after another individual was fatally shot in the incident.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/georgia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Georgia mother&lt;/a&gt; accused of attempting to kill her daughter&apos;s sexual abuser was convicted of murder and other charges after another person was shot and killed in the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danyale Harris, 42, was found guilty of felony murder, aggravated assault, conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 31, 2020, Harris allegedly discovered a video of her daughter, who was 12-years-old at the time, involved in a sexual act with a man later identified as 22-year-old Antonio Harley, according to Fox 5 Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following day, at around 3:30 a.m., Harris reported the information to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;DeKalb County Police officer&lt;/a&gt; of the police department&apos;s Special Victim’s Unit, according to investigators. The officer told Harris that detectives would contact her and warned her not to let her anger get the best of her and not to attempt to find revenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/georgia-suspect-who-stole-frontloader-led-police-wild-chase-stopped-by-employee-another-frontloader&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GEORGIA SUSPECT WHO STOLE FRONTLOADER, LED POLICE ON WILD CHASE, STOPPED BY EMPLOYEE WITH ANOTHER FRONTLOADER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But hours later, Harris drove a large group of people to an apartment complex near the intersection of Wesley Chapel Road and Snapfinger Road to confront Harley for the alleged sexual abuse to her daughter, and three people in the group were armed with handguns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At around 1 p.m., Harris told her daughter to point out which apartment Harley lived in. Harris then knocked on the front door with the rest of her group behind her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harley did not open the door, instead going around the side of the apartment building to see who was there. Harris and the rest of the group then began to chase Harley, but he managed to make it back inside his apartment through the back door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right after Harley closed the door, one person in the group outside fired their gun, striking Harley in the chest. Harley&apos;s brother, who was inside the apartment, shot back as he tried to protect himself and five of his younger siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/georgia-star-running-back-trevor-etienne-arrested-multiple-misdemeanors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;GEORGIA STAR RUNNING BACK TREVOR ETIENNE ARRESTED ON MULTIPLE MISDEMEANORS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juan Newkirk, 19, who was part of the group Harris brought to the apartment, was shot and killed in the exchange of gunfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeKalb County Superior Court Judge Asha F. Jackson, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;presided over the trial&lt;/a&gt;, sentenced Harris to life with the possibility of parole, plus five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two other people involved in the incident were also charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harley, who survived his injuries, was later charged with statutory rape, child molestation and sexual exploitation of children. His case is still pending.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Biden says he is working to secure release of Evan Gershkovich on 1-year anniversary of detention in Russia</title>
                    
                    <description>President Biden said Friday that the U.S. government is &amp;quot;not giving up&amp;quot; on securing the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who is detained in Russia.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt; said Friday, on the one-year anniversary of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich&apos;s detention in Russia, that the U.S. government is working every day to secure his release and is &quot;not giving up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gershkovich, 32, was arrested on espionage charges for allegedly collecting secret military information while he was on a work trip to the Russian city of Yekaterinburg. The Federal Security Service said he was acting on U.S. orders to obtain state secrets, but no evidence was provided to support the accusation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government, The Wall Street Journal and Gershkovich all reject accusations that he was working for the U.S. government to collect Russian secrets, with U.S. officials saying he was wrongfully detained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Journalism is not a crime, and Evan went to Russia to do his job as a reporter —risking his safety to shine the light of truth on Russia’s brutal aggression against Ukraine,&quot; Biden said in a statement Friday. &quot;Shortly after his wholly unjust and illegal detention, he drafted a letter to his family from prison, writing: &apos;I am not losing hope.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/wall-street-journal-leaves-front-page-portion-blank-honor-evan-gershkovich-story-should-here&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WALL STREET JOURNAL LEAVES FRONT PAGE PORTION BLANK IN HONOR OF EVAN GERSHKOVICH: &apos;HIS STORY SHOULD BE HERE&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As I have told Evan&apos;s parents, I will never give up hope either,&quot; he continued. &quot;We will continue working every day to secure his release. We will continue to denounce and impose costs for Russia’s appalling attempts to use Americans as bargaining chips. And we will continue to stand strong against all those who seek to attack the press or target journalists — the pillars of free society.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal on Friday left a blank space on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;front page of its newspaper&lt;/a&gt; with Gershkovich&apos;s image in the space where the image of an article&apos;s author would be and a headline that read: &quot;His Story Should be Here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent court hearing offered little new information in Gershkovich&apos;s case. He was ordered to remain behind bars pending trial until at least June 30, the fifth extension of his detention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I admire the hell out of him,&quot; Biden told reporters Friday when asked about Gershkovich&apos;s case before traveling from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to the Camp David presidential retreat. &quot;We&apos;re not giving up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/fox-nation-prisoner-putin-examines-evan-gershkovichs-life-resilience-while-detained-russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FOX NATION&apos;S ‘PRISONER OF PUTIN’ EXAMINES EVAN GERSHKOVICH’S LIFE, RESILIENCE WHILE DETAINED IN RUSSIA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden said in his statement that the U.S. government was working to free all Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad, including Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, a corporate executive from Michigan who is also locked up in Russia on espionage charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whelan was arrested in 2018 in Russia and, two years later, was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Whelan, who said he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;traveled to Moscow&lt;/a&gt; to attend a friend&apos;s wedding, has denied the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Gershkovich and Whelan have &quot;remained resilient despite the circumstances of living in Russian detention.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People are not bargaining chips,&quot; Blinken said in a statement. &quot;Russia should end its practice of arbitrarily detaining individuals for political leverage and should immediately release Evan and Paul.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-ultimate-power-couple-because-not-intimidated-her-success-expert&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce&apos;s &lt;/a&gt;recent romantic getaway in the Bahamas triggered a massive surge of online searches for the Caribbean island. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift was pictured in a yellow bikini while Kelce went shirtless in blue patterned swim trunks as they enjoyed some fun in the sun on Harbor Island Tuesday in images obtained by Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the explosion of public interest in Harbour Island, here is what to know about Swift and Kelce&apos;s tropical oasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the Bahamas&apos; 700 islands, Harbour Island is located 50 miles east of the Bahamian capital city of Nassau on the island of New Providence. The island is one of the country&apos;s smallest at approximately 3½ miles long and 1½ miles wide. According to the 2010 census, the total population of Harbour Island is 1,762.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-sings-travis-kelce-kisses-him-sydney-stop-eras-tour&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TAYLOR SWIFT SINGS TO TRAVIS KELCE, KISSES HIM AT SYDNEY STOP OF HER ‘ERAS TOUR’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since there is no airport on Harbour Island, visitors to the island must fly into the North Eleuthera (ELH) airport on the nearby island of Eleuthera. After landing in Eleuthera, visitors can take a water taxi to Harbour Island. Traveling the 1.45 miles between the two islands by water taxi usually takes about seven minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the official website for Eleuthera and Harbour Island, celebrities who have rented homes in the idyllic vacation destination include George Clooney, Ryan Reynolds, Tom Hanks, Mick Jagger, Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Dwyane Wade, Bono, Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Aniston, Elle MacPherson, Jennifer Hudson, Richard Gere, Tyra Banks and Bella Hadid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During their vacation, Swift and Kelce reportedly stayed at Harbour Island&apos;s Rosalita House, prompting a 1,556% surge in searches for the luxury, beachfront villa, according to the Daily Mail. The outlet reported that research for the Bahamas spiked 341% after photos of the couple on the beach surfaced online. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunmore Town, which was named after the 18th-century governor of the Bahamas, John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, is the only town on the island. The town features boutique hotels, small shops, restaurants, grocery stores and a historic district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harbour Island is most famed for its 3-mile stretch of pink sand beaches. The beaches&apos; pink hue is derived from foraminifera, a microscopic organism that has a reddish-pink shell.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bordering the pink beaches is the most exclusive enclave of the island, The Narrows, also known as Millionaire&apos;s Row. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to CNBC, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/bill-gates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Bill Gates,&lt;/a&gt; Ron Perlman, former J.Crew and Gap CEO Mickey Drexler, Chairman and Senior Executive of IAC and Expedia Group Barry Diller, fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg and Miami Dophins owner Wayne Huizenga own homes on Harbour Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the island features mansions, resorts and private villas, it is best known for its pastel-colored cottages and traditional Bahamian architecture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Popular activities on Harbour Island include snorkeling, scuba diving, swimming, sunbathing, tennis, horseback ridingand shopping. Tourists can also visit spas for a variety of beauty and wellness treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally inhabited by the Arawak, one of the two tribes of Lucayan Indians, Christopher Columbus discovered the island in 1492 during an expedition. The Lucayans were subsequently wiped out by the Spanish conquistadors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The island remained uninhabited for 100 years until British Puritans seeking religious freedom settled on the island in 1650. In 1717, the Bahamas, including the islands of Eleuthera and Harbour Island, became a colony of the British Crown. The Bahamas gained its governmental independence in 1973 and became the 49th member of the British Commonwealth. Its current monarch is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/king-charles-iii&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;King Charles III. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harbour Island started to become a popular tourist destination in the 1920s. After Bahamas Airlines began flying into the Eleuthera airport, tourism exploded and became the main industry of Harbour Island. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>FBI agents told an Oklahoma woman that they spend &amp;quot;every day, all day long&amp;quot; interrogating people about social media activity when they arrived at her home in response to her posts.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/fbi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;FBI agents&lt;/a&gt; told an Oklahoma woman that the agency spends &quot;every day, all day long&quot; questioning people about their social media posts when they arrived at her house to ask about posts she made online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rolla Abdeljawad, of Stillwater, was told by FBI agents who showed up at her home on Wednesday that Facebook had handed over screenshots of her posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdeljawad told the agents she did not want to talk and asked them to show their badges on camera, but the agents refused, video posted to the social media platform X by her lawyer, Hassan Shibly, shows. The woman wrote on Facebook that she later confirmed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;local police&lt;/a&gt; that the people who showed up at her home were actually FBI agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Facebook gave us a couple of screenshots of your account,&quot; one agent wearing a gray shirt was heard saying in the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-slam-200-million-funding-new-fbi-hq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOUSE REPUBLICANS SLAM $200 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR NEW FBI HQ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdeljawad replied, &quot;So we no longer live in a free country, and we can&apos;t say what we want?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, we totally do,&quot; another agent wearing a red shirt said. &quot;That&apos;s why we&apos;re not here to arrest you or anything. We do this every day, all day long. It&apos;s just an effort to keep everybody safe and make sure nobody has any ill will.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman then said, &quot;All I&apos;ve done is exercise my right as an American citizen on a public social media platform with my personal opinions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear which posts caught the attention of the FBI, but Abdeljawad has made a series of posts in the past week expressing frustration about the ongoing war in Gaza between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists, including referring to Israel as &quot;Israhell.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Israhelli terrorist filth,&quot; she said in one post. &quot;They think Ramadan is a weakness for Muslims not, realizing Ramadan is the strength. #FreePalestine May Allah destroy every single despicable zionist, their supporters and backers. Ameen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdeljawad&apos;s Facebook timeline is also public, meaning the FBI agents could have accessed her posts themselves without requesting screenshots from Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/former-fbi-agent-accused-revenge-porn-hidden-cameras-could-have-upwards-80-victims-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORMER FBI AGENT ACCUSED OF &apos;REVENGE PORN&apos; WITH HIDDEN CAMERAS COULD HAVE UPWARDS OF 80 VICTIMS: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her posts even warned the Muslim community and people who are pro-Palestinian to be wary of the U.S. government monitoring their activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don&apos;t fall for their games. Our community is being watched &amp;amp; they are just waiting for any reason to round us up,&quot; Abdeljawad wrote on March 24. &quot;If you&apos;re Muslim and/or pro-pal consider all your media accounts, Google searches, mail, messenger, local mosques &amp;amp; political events monitored. #NYC #usa #PoliceState #FreePalestine&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official policy of Meta, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Facebook&apos;s parent company&lt;/a&gt;, is to give law enforcement Facebook data following a court order, subpoena, search warrant or emergency situation involving &quot;imminent harm to a child or risk of death or serious physical injury to any person.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first half of 2023, the social media giant received nearly 74,000 requests from law enforcement and handed over data 88% of the time, according to Meta&apos;s website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdeljawad said in a post on Thursday that her lawyer does not believe Facebook sent the FBI the screenshots of her posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rather, it seems like a fishing expedition,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I do not fear them. My only concern as, I told the cop is that, someone in my state will do something or that they would and then use my posts in a malicious attempt to &apos;smear&apos; me. Just *remember, I am a Muslim, an obligated protector of creation. I enjoin what is good and forbid what is wrong.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shibly said in the caption on the social media video that Abdeljawad made the correct decision to refuse to speak without a lawyer, to not allow them in her house and to record the interaction. But, he says, she should not have gone outside her house to talk to the agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You have the right never to speak to the FBI without a lawyer,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Duke men’s basketball outlasted top-seeded Houston on Friday night to advance to the Elite Eight where they will face ACC rival North Carolina State.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/duke-blue-devils&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Duke men’s basketball&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is back in the Elite Eight after outlasting a physical Houston with a 54-51 win in the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament on Friday night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Houston’s top-ranked defense kept Duke at bay in the first half, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/houston-cougars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Cougars&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suffered a tough blow when All-American guard Jamal Shead went down with an apparent foot injury while driving towards the basket with just a little over six minutes left in the half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After remaining on the ground visibly in pain, Shead was helped up and eventually walked back to the locker room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to reports, his X-rays came back negative, and he was diagnosed with a severely sprained right ankle. He would remain on the sidelines for the rest of the game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But without Shead, Duke managed to pull away in the second half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyle Filipowski had 16 points and nine rebounds to lead the charge, but Jeremy Roach&apos;s 14 second-half points kept the momentum going. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m really proud of these guys and really proud of the game tonight – that was a big time &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;college basketball&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; game,&quot; Duke head coach Jon Scheyer said after the game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nc-states-cinderella-story-continues-as-underdog-wolfpack-knockoff-marquette-to-reach-elite-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NC STATE&apos;S CINDERELLA STORY CONTINUES, AS UNDERDOG WOLFPACK KNOCKOFF MARQUETTE TO REACH ELITE 8&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheyer went on to compliment Houston’s fortitude despite the loss of Shead, and made a point to silence any criticisms about Duke’s own toughness after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/tennessee-volunteers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;a loss to Tennessee&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the second round last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look, we started four freshmen last year,&quot; he began, &quot;I think for us, some of the criticism about toughness or whatever – try being at Duke as a freshman or sophomore and battling your ass off in the tournament, and then talk to me about being tough.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duke now moves on to face Atlantic Coast Conference rival North Carolina State for a spot in the Final Four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>NC State&apos;s Cinderella story continues, as underdog Wolfpack knockoff Marquette to reach Elite 8</title>
                    
                    <description>The NC State men&amp;apos;s basketball team may have played in the ACC and won national titles in the past, but being an eleventh seed still certainly makes them a Cinderella story.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the number of underdogs in this year&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk/march-madness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NCAA Division I men&apos;s basketball tournament&lt;/a&gt; continues to dwindle, the North Carolina State Wolfpack are doing their part to keep the magic alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The No. 11 Wolfpack knocked off the second-seeded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/marquette-golden-eagles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Marquette Golden Eagles&lt;/a&gt; on Friday night. The 67-58 win lifted NC State to the Elite Eight for the first time since 1986. The Wolfpack had to put together a string of wins in the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament just to qualify for the big dance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NC State has now won eight straight games since the start of the ACC tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s magical, but I’m going to say we knew this from day one,&quot; said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/north-carolina-state-wolfpack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NC State&apos;s DJ Horne&lt;/a&gt;, whose team lost seven of nine to finish the regular season. &quot;We knew we were a good team. It was all a matter of just locking in and understanding our roles, and no better time to be doing that than now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/clemson-stuns-arizona-survives-second-half-surge-reach-elite-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLEMSON STUNS ARIZONA, SURVIVES SECOND-HALF SURGE TO REACH ELITE 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NC State awaits the winner of the highly-anticipated matchup between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/houston-cougars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;top-seeded Houston&lt;/a&gt; or No. 4 seed Duke on Sunday for a spot in the Final Four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time the Wolfpack went that far 41 years ago, they had to win the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ACC Tournament&lt;/a&gt; before the late Jim Valvano sprinted around the court trying to find someone to hug after a still-talked-about upset of high-flying Houston for the title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Golden Eagles couldn’t overcome an unsightly shooting performance in their first trip to the Sweet 16 since 2013. They went 4 of 31 (12.9%) from 3-point range and shot 33.3% overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We talked about being very stingy defensively,&quot; NC State coach Keatts said. &quot;Marquette’s a really good basketball team. They do a great job. I thought we were better defensively.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third-year coach Shaka Smart is 0-2 in the NCAA Tournament in Texas with Marquette — including North Carolina’s first-round blowout two years ago — after failing to win a tournament game in six seasons leading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/texas-longhorns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Longhorns&lt;/a&gt;. Friday&apos;s Sweet 16 game was played in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The worst part about losing today is that we don’t have practice tomorrow,&quot; Smart said. &quot;We don’t have another game to prepare for.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finish of the first half said it all as the Golden Eagles finished with a season low in points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Top UK health official urges against eating whole Easter egg in &apos;one go&apos; hit with backlash: &apos;Life too short&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>After a director for England&amp;apos;s National Health Service warned about eating a whole chocolate Easter egg in &amp;quot;one go,&amp;quot; doctors took to social media to tell people that, &amp;quot;life is too short&amp;quot; to not eat the whole egg.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After a top &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;England&apos;s National Health Service&lt;/a&gt; (NHS) director warned people &quot;not to eat the whole Easter egg in one go,&quot; doctors hit back, saying that &quot;life is too short&quot; to cut back this holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a blog post, Dr Andrew Kelso, a NHS medical director, advised people to watch their waistline and show constraint when it comes to chocolate treats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I urge people to enjoy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/easter-god-love-should-not-be-domesticated-bishop-robert-barron&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;their Easter eggs&lt;/a&gt; in moderation,&quot; Kelso said. &quot;Enjoy your sweet treats but don’t overdo it.&quot;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/reddit-user-left-drunk-husband-airport-support-others-problem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REDDIT USER WHO LEFT HER DRUNK HUSBAND BEHIND AT AIRPORT GETS SUPPORT FROM OTHERS: ‘HAS A PROBLEM’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The top doctor&lt;/a&gt; said that his warning was timely due to an increase in obesity, Type 2 diabetes and tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/holy-week-leads-faithful-easter-sunday-special-days-observed-what-they-mean&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HOLY WEEK LEADS THE FAITHFUL TO EASTER SUNDAY: HERE ARE THE SPECIAL DAYS OBSERVED AND WHAT THEY MEAN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Many people don’t realize that an average Easter egg contains around three-quarters of an adult’s recommended &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/how-many-calories-do-you-actually-need-per-day&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;daily calorie intake&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; Kelso said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At a time like this when we are seeing significant increases in cases of obesity and Type 2 diabetes, as well as tooth decay, I urge people to enjoy their Easter eggs in moderation and resist the urge to eat a whole egg in one go,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the top doctor&apos;s advice, others in&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/health-care&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; the medical community&lt;/a&gt; were quick to advise the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m an intensive care doctor. Life is short. Eat the Easter egg,&quot; @madbusymum wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m a dentist,&quot; @wendythedentist replied. &quot;Eat the Easter egg all at once!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m an Intensive Care Nurse. I totally agree,&quot; @shinybluedress wrote.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A United Airlines flight was diverted to upstate New York because of high winds at its destination, Newark, New Jersey, the airline said.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At least six people on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/airlines&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;United Airlines&lt;/a&gt; flight bound for New Jersey were hospitalized when the plane was diverted Friday to an upstate New York airport because of high winds and a sick passenger, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;United Airlines flight 85 landed safely at New York Stewart International Airport in New Windsor around 6:45 p.m. after high winds were reported at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/airports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Newark Liberty International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, a United statement to Fox News Digital stated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-man-calls-american-airlines-passengers-blue-eyed-white-devils-threatens-take-plane-down&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FLORIDA MAN CALLS AMERICAN AIRLINES PASSENGERS ‘BLUE-EYED WHITE DEVILS,’ THREATENS TO &apos;TAKE THIS PLANE DOWN&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plane originally departed from Tel Aviv, Israel, the Federal Aviation Administration told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five EMTs and paramedics responded to the New Windsor airport after the plane experienced turbulence, New Windsor EMS said in a social media post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a United spokesperson told Fox News Digital that there was no &quot;extreme turbulence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;One passenger deplaned due to a medical incident, and a few other customers were seen by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;medical personnel&lt;/a&gt; for possible motion sickness,&quot; United said. &quot;The flight refueled and continued to Newark tonight.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 310 passengers and crew on board, some were treated for minor ailments and six were taken to local hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FAA is investigating the incident. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

He adds, &quot;Cowards! Go chase the money! You money suckers!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6349766278112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN HECKLED BY PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTER DURING HEALTHCARE SPEECH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The council shared the videos on X, writing: &quot;Yesterday, the Berkeley City Council held its final meeting before a one-month recess. The agenda of the meeting included an item on marking Holocaust Remembrance Day and funding educational programs around this commemoration. There was nothing on the meeting agenda about the Israel-Hamas War. Demonstrators called Jews ‘Zionist pigs,’ intimidated a Holocaust survivor, stole and threw a Jewish man&apos;s phone toward the dais and implied city council members were being bought by the Jewish community. Warning: Explicit language.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pro-palestinian-protest-breaks-out-inside-senate-office-building-interrupts-interview-cease-fire-chants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTER BREAKS OUT INSIDE SENATE OFFICE BUILDING, INTERRUPTS INTERVIEW WITH CEASE-FIRE CHANTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters also repeatedly shouted &quot;Lies!&quot; while 89-year-old Holocaust survivor Susanne DeWitt urged the City Council to adopt the Holocaust Remembrance Day proclamation because of a &quot;horrendous surge in antisemitism.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protesters constantly interrupted DeWitt as she addressed the council and spoke about 1,200 Israelis being killed by Hamas and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/hamas-terrorists-systematically-intentionally-committed-sexual-violence-oct-7-attack-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;women being &quot;tortured and raped.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeWitt was taken to the Dachau Concentration Camp when she was 4 years old, the JCRC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stop heckling,&quot; DeWitt said, turning around to the protesters in the room as the moderator tried to quiet them. &quot;Stop lying!&quot; a protester replied.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a Zionist stronghold,&quot; another protester claimed later, pointing to council members. &quot;The city of Berkeley, the people of Berkeley love Palestine.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protest comes as The University of California, Berkeley campus has been inundated with Pro-Palestinian protests and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/anti-semitism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; concerns about antisemitism&lt;/a&gt; at the school have risen since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, after Hamas terrorists&apos; unprovoked attack on the country in October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, pro-Palestinian protesters disrupted an Israeli &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/jewish-students-uc-berkeley-fight-campus-antisemitism-not-hiding-anymore&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;soldier&apos;s speaking event&lt;/a&gt; at Berkeley&apos;s campus, screaming slurs like at Jewish attendees. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Braves manager Brian Snitker&apos;s family skips opening day trip to Philadelphia due to &apos;hostile crowd&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Philadelphia might be the City of Brotherly Love, but Braves skipper Brian Snitker made sure his family and some friends weren&amp;apos;t inside the Phillies&amp;apos; ballpark for opening day.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brian Snitker has spent nearly four decades with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/atlanta-braves&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt;. During that time, he has become well-versed in what it takes to handle the Philadelphia Phillies crowds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snitker recently spoke about the way some of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/philadelphia-phillies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Phillies&apos;&lt;/a&gt; fans treated his family and friends during last season&apos;s NL Division Series. Snitker said some of the fan behavior had him concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s rough there,&quot; Snitker said in an interview with Atlanta radio station WZGC last week. &quot;And they don’t seem to mind, either, quite honestly. It was rough on them all last year to the point where it was concerning.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Braves won the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 and have taken the NL East crown six years in a row. But the Phillies have had the Braves&apos; number recently in the postseason. Philadelphia has qualified for the playoffs as a wild-card team over the past couple of years, knocking out Atlanta back-to-back years in an NLDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tensions-boil-mets-brewers-opening-day-game-rhys-hoskins-slide-jeff-mcneil&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TENSIONS BOIL IN METS-BREWERS OPENING DAY GAME AFTER RHYS HOSKINS&apos; SLIDE INTO JEFF MCNEIL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Phillies&apos; Citizens Bank Park celebrates its 20-year anniversary this season. It has become known as one of the loudest and most hostile environments for opposing teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snitker said Philly had &quot;by far the most hostile crowd,&quot; and his wife would refuse to return to the Phillies&apos; ballpark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked what made his family feel unsafe at the ballpark, Snitker responded by saying, &quot;I’m not going to get into all that. Let’s talk about today.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My wife’s babysitting, and the grandkids are in school,&quot; Snitker said in Atlanta’s dugout. &quot;They wouldn’t be anywhere, honestly, other than home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a passionate fan base, and there’s a lot of energy in the air, and rightly so,&quot; Snitker said. &quot;This is a really good club. These fans are passionate about what they do. It’s a fun place to come play, quite honestly, because there is a lot of energy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snitker brushed off nearly 45,000 booing fans and broke out a wide smile and laughed as he jogged to the third base line during lineup introductions ahead of Atlanta’s 9-3 win over the Phillies on opening day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They don’t boo nobodies,&quot; Braves star pitcher Spencer Strider said. &quot;That’s what I’ve been told. I like playing here. It’s a fun place to play. There’s passionate fans and a good team on the other side of the field. Usually it leads to a good game.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>NFL Draft prospect Jayden Daniels puts elbow concerns to rest after strange photo goes viral</title>
                    
                    <description>Highly touted NFL Draft prospect Jayden Daniels put concerns about his elbow to rest after a photo of him throwing went viral this week.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels could be one of the first quarterbacks off the board next month in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl-draft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NFL Draft,&lt;/a&gt; and he’s already turning heads on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFL fans were quick to wonder about Daniels after a picture of his throwing arm went viral. Fans focused on the way his elbow looked as he threw in a few photos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pictures appeared to show Daniels’ elbow protruding outward and away from the rest of his arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Daniels cleared up any misconceptions about his elbow on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;my elbow is perfectly fine .. stop the cap (lies)!!&quot; he wrote on the social media platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1773012995896926413&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW THE POST ON X.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of NFL teams that will be searching for a quarterback early in the first round, and Daniels is among the favorites to be selected within the top five. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFL Network’s Bucky Brooks has Daniels going No. 2 to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/washington-commanders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Washington Commanders&lt;/a&gt;. Even Brian Kelly believed it too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-andy-reid-impresses-perfect-ceremonial-first-pitch-royals-opening-day&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHIEFS&apos; ANDY REID IMPRESSES WITH PERFECT CEREMONIAL FIRST PITCH AT ROYALS&apos; OPENING DAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He&apos;s going to be so committed to taking care of himself that you&apos;re not going to have to worry about size or [if] he doesn&apos;t weigh enough,&quot; Kelly said Wednesday, via CBS Sports. &quot;Lamar (Jackson) has done a pretty good job with his size. (Patrick) Mahomes — I wouldn&apos;t consider him a giant. Because he (Daniels) is going to get the ball out to the playmakers and make plays. For Washington.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Tigers star was the 2023 Heisman Trophy winner. He threw for 3,812 yards, 40 touchdowns and only four interceptions last season. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/lsu-tigers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;LSU finished&lt;/a&gt; the season 10-3 as Garrett Nussmeier replaced Daniels to win the ReliaQuest Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All eyes will be on Daniels when April 25 arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News host Jesse Watters discusses the latest developments into the investigation of Rapper Sean &apos;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-declares-innocence-after-federal-agents-raid-his-homes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Diddy&lt;/a&gt;&apos; Combs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JESSE WATTERS:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;i&gt;We found Diddy, the disgraced billionaire hip hop mogul and Democratic Party community organizer, was spotted for the first time since having his homes raided in a major sex trafficking investigation similar to Jeffrey Epstein&apos;s. They say he was seen swinging clubs at a Topgolf in Miami with his daughters. He may look relaxed, but behind the scenes there&apos;s panic. TMZ reporting tonight that the federal case against him is expanding, as prosecutors from the Southern District of New York have been dishing out subpoenas to multiple corporations tied to the mogul, like cell phone providers and computer companies. At the same time, Diddy&apos;s been unloading his assets. The timing not coincidental. Selling off his stake in Revolt TV and returning music rights from Bad Boy Records. TMZ reporting the feds slapping subpoenas on Diddy&apos;s chartered jets. Now, sources say even commercial airlines will be subpoenaed, possibly the FAA, as investigators look for anyone who flew on Diddy&apos;s dime. They&apos;re not only looking for victims, they&apos;re looking for witnesses. People with unfettered access to Diddy&apos;s alleged crimes and freak off parties. Some inside of Diddy&apos;s world have already started talking. Diddy&apos;s former bodyguard says he&apos;ll go on the stand. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rapper-sean-diddy-combs-prolific-supporter-democrats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAPPER SEAN ‘DIDDY’ COMBS HAS BEEN A PROLIFIC SUPPORTER OF DEMOCRATS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;With subpoenas raining down, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rapper-sean-diddy-combs-homes-raided-homeland-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Diddy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&apos;s inner circle is getting squeezed. His alleged drug mules already been handcuffed. Diddy&apos;s ex-girlfriend Young Miami, who allegedly transported his pink cocaine on private jets, she&apos;s feeling the heat. The question investigators are looking to answer is who else was involved? As Primetime reported yesterday, the feds seized all of Diddy&apos;s surveillance footage in addition to hard drives and phones. They want to know who was in and out of Diddy&apos;s planes and his homes. As Little Rod&apos;s lawsuit alleges, they weren&apos;t just up-and-coming artists. These were celebrities, politicians, athletes, international dignitaries and music label executives, all captured on camera in Diddy&apos;s compounds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Michael Rapaport skewers The Squad as &apos;dangerous&apos; &apos;race hustlers:&apos; &apos;Totally full of s---&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Actor Michael Rapaport explained in an interview that multiple political problems have soured his view on the Democratic Party and made him lean towards voting for Trump.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Comedian and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/comedian-michael-rapaport-excoriates-pro-palestinian-college-students-stop-wasting-money&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;pro-Israel advocate Michael Rapaport&lt;/a&gt; shredded what the modern Democratic Party has become and explained why he is increasingly considering voting for Trump in a new interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a series about the Israel-Hamas conflict that rages in the Middle East, an interviewer from Visegrad24 spoke to Rapaport on the shores of an Israeli beach and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwFe_dieezg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Have your political views shifted? You’ve been a very vocal anti-Trump - probably the most vocal anti-Trump celebrity out there. Have your views shifted? I mean, a lot of Israelis are very supportive of Donald Trump, right?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapaport explained that his views have radically shifted toward the former president, particularly amid the war in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In all honesty, I have educated myself so much since 2016, and I have a ways to go. My political views have changed immensely and they&apos;re changing at a rapid pace,&quot; he said. &quot;I will not vote for Joe Biden. I do not support anybody from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/the-squad&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Squad,&lt;/a&gt; I think they&apos;re totally full of s---, I think they&apos;re dangerous, I think they&apos;re race hustlers, I think they&apos;re cons, I think inevitably they want to get themselves production deals to produce documentaries, I think they&apos;re three-card monte-playing bulls--- artists, I think they totally have an agenda.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-rapaport-blasts-golden-globe-attendees-not-mentioning-israeli-hostages-should-ashamed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MICHAEL RAPAPORT BLASTS GOLDEN GLOBE ATTENDEES FOR NOT MENTIONING ISRAELI HOSTAGES: &apos;WE SHOULD BE ASHAMED&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also reiterated a claim he has made in the past, &quot;I have said, you know, not to go down the rabbit hole - that at this point, when we&apos;re doing this interview, voting for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/far-left-comic-michael-rapaport-says-voting-trump-table-after-seeing-illegals-beat-nypd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trump is on the table.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapaport explained that when people question him about this, he can cite concrete reasons that stem from modern political realities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People are like ‘What are you talking about?’ That&apos;s my reality, that is my reality. I will not support anybody who&apos;s anti-Israel,&quot; adding he is also against anybody who is against &quot;making America safe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also juxtaposed America’s open border with strict airport security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/left-wing-actor-goes-viral-vulgar-rant-trump-courtroom-sketch&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LEFT-WING ACTOR GOES VIRAL FOR VULGAR RANT OVER TRUMP COURTROOM SKETCH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actor also declared, &quot;I&apos;m not supporting anybody that is cool with the fact that it takes me 2 and a half hours to get back into America from Toronto,&quot; due to passport control, &quot;as it should,&quot; while on the other hand, &quot;it takes you two minutes to cross the border, I&apos;m not down with that s—t.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapaport also referred to a viral video he filmed where a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/michael-rapaport-films-robbery-new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;man appeared to shoplift&lt;/a&gt; bags full of items from a Rite-Aid in New York, slamming the idea that somebody can nonchalantly steal and then calmly exit, &quot;walking like you’re on a beautiful spring day walk.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He concluded, &quot;I’m not down with any of that s---, so any of these people that support it, I&apos;m not voting for them. So, yes, my political views have changed a lot. I&apos;m voting with my money, and I&apos;m voting with Israel. I&apos;m not getting caught up or suckered into these race politics or any of that bulls--- anymore. Yeah, they have changed, and they&apos;re going to continue to change and evolve. It&apos;s a crazy time in American politics.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Georgia House and Senate showcase contrasting priorities as 2024 session ends</title>
                    
                    <description>The 2024 legislative session in Georgia showcased contrasting priorities between the House and Senate, with minority Democrats unable to leverage those differences.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA (AP) — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-immigration-bill-compel-law-enforcement-work-federal-officials-goes-gov-kemp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Georgia&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; 2024 legislative session again showcased contrasting Republican approaches to governing, while minority Democrats couldn&apos;t leverage those differences to advance top policy priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while many GOP initiatives in the state Senate seemed like appeals to that party&apos;s primary voters, Republicans are hoping tax cuts and a harder line on immigration will carry them to victory in November&apos;s legislative races. Democrats walked away more furious than ever about the failure to expand Medicaid health insurance, one cornerstone of their campaign to make gains in the state House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-appeals-georgia-court-order-that-keeps-fani-willis-on-the-case-should-have-been-disqualified&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP APPEALS GEORGIA COURT ORDER THAT KEEPS FANI WILLIS ON THE CASE: &apos;SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISQUALIFIED&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the background of 2024 campaigns for all 236 state legislative seats is jockeying for elections to statewide office in 2026. Republican Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, displaying a conservative edge, seems more likely than ever to run to succeed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-governor-brian-kemp-demands-answers-from-president-biden-laken-riley-killers-immigration-status&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Gov. Brian Kemp&lt;/a&gt;, as many GOP lawmakers try to satisfy an activist base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some issues unified Republicans, including speeding up an income tax cut, uniting around a crackdown on undocumented immigrants in jails, and pay raises for teachers and state employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there&apos;s a continuing power struggle between the chambers. Last year, that conflict burst into the open, with House and Senate leaders killing bills from the other chamber in a dispute that was set off by Jones&apos; push to loosen health care permitting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones won a partial loosening of those rules this year, and conflict overall was less public. But sharp disagreements were evident as each chamber completely disregarded measures passed by the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You know, some folks choose politics. The House chooses results,&quot; Republican House Speaker Jon Burns of Newington told reporters moments after the House adjourned at 12:58 a.m. Friday. He and other House leaders said they instead focused on &quot;kitchen table&quot; issues often funded through the budget, like a spending boost for prekindergarten programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Divisions showed in how, even more than normal, decisions cascaded into the last hours of the last legislative day. Both the House and Senate blew past a once-sacrosanct midnight deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There were a lot of challenges and tensions between the two chambers. It’s not the first time, but it was particularly elevated this year.&quot; said Rep. Scott Holcomb. The Atlanta Democrat again saw the Senate snub his push to compensate people released from prison after they are exonerated, even though top House Republicans supported the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was far from the only initiative that failed. The Senate spent precious time on the session&apos;s last day passing a ban on puberty blocking drugs for transgender youth, but the bill sank without a trace in the House. So did an education bill that sought to cut back on sex education and write a ban on transgender girls playing girls&apos; sports into law, as well as a Senate bill banning public money from being spent on what Republican senators say is the left-wing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/judy-blume-american-library-association-win-national-book-critics-circle-awards&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;American Library Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To me, the 2024 session was a battle of the far-right Senate versus the moderate Republican House, in which the House ultimately prevailed by stopping the vast majority of these culture war issues, from attacks against transgender youth to putting a Clarence Thomas monument on the Capitol grounds,&quot; House Minority Whip Sam Park, a Lawrenceville Democrat, said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on some other terms, the Senate may the winner. All of the priorities the Senate Republican Caucus announced in January became law. That included a bill requiring cash bail for more crimes, and a call for private and home school vouchers that finally passed the House after Kemp and House leaders joined the push. A Senate-backed bill requiring parental consent before children younger than 16 can sign up for social media is also on the way to Kemp&apos;s desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m proud of all that the Senate accomplished this session, promoting an agenda to help Georgia families, expand access to health care, support HBCUs, crack down on sanctuary policies and protect women&apos;s sports,&quot; Jones said in a statement Friday. &quot;These issues are a marathon, not a sprint, and we&apos;ll continue to build on our accomplishments year after year to enact policies that lift up the middle class and fight back against radical Democrats&apos; insanity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Democrats, though, it was another year of frustration. After Burns opened the door to Medicaid expansion, the minority party worked feverishly to try to expand health coverage to lower-income adults. They even believed they had a deal with Senate leadership to bring forward a bill at the last minute, only to claim betrayal after it was voted down in committee by Republicans who said they wanted to support Kemp&apos;s struggling Pathways program that offers insurance only with proof of work or study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The problem is that Georgia’s health care policy failures are deliberate choices made by Gov. Kemp and the Republican leadership in the legislature,&quot; outgoing House Minority Leader Gloria Butler, a Stone Mountain Democrat, told reporters. &quot;We were told to let them cook. We were told that if we were nice to Republicans and if we asked politely, Medicaid expansion would be on the table. But guess what? It is still on the table.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Five people were wounded outside a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/michigan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;bar in Detroit&lt;/a&gt; after a disagreement over a parking spot, police said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Detroit Police Department Assistant Police Chief Charles Fitzgerald said during a press conference that the fight broke out at about 2:45 a.m. on Friday at Chicago Blu&apos;z Bar &amp;amp; Grill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Senseless, ridiculous,&quot; Fitzgerald said. &quot;Five people to be shot over a parking spot is just silly to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Police said that&lt;/a&gt; the fight over the parking spot quickly turned violent after one man pulled out a firearm and began firing into a crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/3-pennsylvania-men-convictions-overturned-decades-behind-bars-womans-1997-killing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 PENNSYLVANIA MEN HAVE CONVICTION OVERTURNED AFTER DECADES BEHIND BARS IN WOMAN&apos;S 1997 KILLING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victims, who ranged in age from 33-49, suffered non-life-threatening injuries, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/nj-man-arrested-9-year-old-son-found-dead-burning-car&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NJ MAN ARRESTED AFTER 9-YEAR-OLD SON FOUND DEAD INSIDE BURNING CAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one of the five victims was involved in the dispute, while the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;others were bystanders&lt;/a&gt;, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The male suspect was still at large as of Friday evening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He left the area in a dark-colored SUV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitzgerald said that they are investigating why the bar was open at 2:45 a.m., noting that it should have been closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Obviously, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/bars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;this blues club&lt;/a&gt; should not have been open at 2:45 a.m. where they&apos;re still arguing for a parking spot,&quot; Fitzgerald said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with information is asked to contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-SPEAK-UP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
