                    <description>John Sinclair, a music producer and poet whose prison sentence inspired a star-studded concert and John Lennon song, died Tuesday morning of congestive heart failure at age 82.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — John Sinclair, a poet, music producer and counterculture figure whose lengthy prison sentence after a series of small-time pot busts inspired a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/beatles-john-lennon-resented-muhammad-ali-knockout-shoot-mistake&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;John Lennon&lt;/a&gt; song and a star-studded 1971 concert to free him, has died. He was 82.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair died Tuesday morning at Detroit Receiving Hospital of congestive heart failure following an illness, his publicist Matt Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/beatles-legend-john-lennon-assassinated-43-years-ago-what-to-know&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEATLES LEGEND JOHN LENNON ASSASSINATED 43 YEARS AGO: WHAT TO KNOW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair drew a 9 1/2-to-10-year prison sentence in 1969 from Detroit Recorder’s Court Judge Robert Colombo for giving two joints to undercover officers. He served 29 months but was released a few days after Lennon, Stevie Wonder, Bob Seger and others performed in front of 15,000 attendees at the University of Michigan’s Crisler Arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They gave him 10 for two/What else can Judge Colombo do/We gotta set him free,&quot; Lennon sang in &quot;John Sinclair,&quot; a song the ex-Beatle wrote that immortalized its subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lennon and his wife, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/paul-mccartney-beatles-allowed-yoko-ono-nonconfrontational-deference-john&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Yoko Ono&lt;/a&gt;, performed at the Dec. 10-11, 1971, &quot;John Sinclair Freedom Rally,&quot; held at the basketball arena in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/ann-arbor-mi-police-cease-most-traffic-stops-minor-violations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ann Arbor&lt;/a&gt;. They took the stage after 3 a.m., about eight hours after the event got underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the night, Sinclair’s wife, Leni, had called her imprisoned husband, and the conversation between the couple and their 4-year-old daughter, Sunny, was amplified for the crowd, who chanted &quot;Free John!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m trying to get home. I want to be with you,&quot; a sobbing Sinclair told the crowd that night, a Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he was by Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of Sinclair’s arrest, possession of marijuana was a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. He was arrested in Detroit while living as a poet and activist who co-founded the White Panther Party. He received the maximum sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day before the concert, the Michigan Legislature voted to reduce to a misdemeanor the penalty for possession of small amounts of marijuana, punishable by up to a year in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because he already had served 2 1/2 years, Sinclair was released from prison three days after the concert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For me, it’s like coming into a whole different world from the one I left in 1969,&quot; Sinclair wrote in &quot;Guitar Army,&quot; a collection of his writings that was published in the early 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair continued his advocacy for marijuana, helping to usher in Ann Arbor’s token $5 fine for pot possession and celebrating when his home state legalized recreational cannabis in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m the pioneer. I was the first one in Michigan who said marijuana should be legal, and they said I was totally nuts,&quot; he told the Detroit Free Press in 2019. &quot;I’m proud to have played a part in this. I spent nearly three years in prison because of marijuana.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair was born in Flint in 1941. His father worked for Buick for over four decades and his mother was a high school teacher who gave up her job to raise John and his two siblings. Sinclair grew up in Davison, a town not far from Flint, and graduated from the University of Michigan-Flint in 1964 with a degree in English Literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next six-plus decades, Sinclair did a bit of everything — dabbling in performance art, journalism, cultural and political activism. And, of course, poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You got to/live it not just/say it or/play it that’s what this is/all/about,&quot; Sinclair wrote in a 1965 poem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon the dissolution of the White Panther Party in 1971, Sinclair formed and chaired the Rainbow People’s Party, which embraced Marxism-Leninism and promoted the revolutionary struggle for a &quot;communal, classless, anti-imperialist, anti-racist, and anti-sexist ... culture of liberation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair proudly and aggressively fought for progressive policies as part of the burgeoning &quot;New Left&quot; movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In those times, we considered ourselves revolutionaries,&quot; he said in 2013. &quot;We wanted equal distribution of wealth. We didn’t want 1 percent of the rich running everything. Of course, we lost.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair often kept a toehold in the world of music, managing for a time Mitch Ryder and perhaps most notably MC5, a Detroit-based quintet known for &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot; and as a hard-rocking forerunner to the punk movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Guitar World,&quot; Sinclair described &quot;the crazed guerilla warfare we were waging with the MC5.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair&apos;s death came only two months after MC5 co-founder Wayne Kramer&apos;s passing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair also promoted concerts and festivals and helped to establish the Detroit Artists Workshop and Detroit Jazz Center. He taught blues history at Wayne State University; hosted radio programs in Detroit, New Orleans and Amsterdam; and wrote liner notes for albums by artists including The Isley Brothers and Harold Melvin &amp;amp; The Blue Notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair never stopped promoting — and partaking in — the use of marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He helped create Hash Bash, a yearly pot celebration at the University of Michigan, and served as state coordinator of the Michigan chapter of NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The only issue I’ve really kept active on is marijuana, because it’s so important,&quot; he told the Free Press. &quot;It’s been a continuous war for 80 years on people like you and me. They’ve got no business messing with us for getting high.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair had two daughters from his marriage to Leni Sinclair. They divorced in 1988. In 1989, Sinclair married Patricia Brown.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Belarusian authorities have arrested well-known activist Dzmitry Kuchuk for &amp;apos;organizing activities that grossly violate public order;&amp;apos; he faces up to four years in prison.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Authorities in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/belarus-raids-target-opposition-run-peoples-embassies-authorities-confirm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt; have arrested a well-known activist on charges punishable by up to four years in prison, the country&apos;s oldest rights group said Tuesday in what appears to be the latest in the yearslong crackdown on dissent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dzmitry Kuchuk, whose Green Party was shut down last year, has been charged with &quot;organizing activities that grossly violate public order,&quot; according to the Viasna human rights center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/independent-belarusian-journalist-tried-so-called-extremism-case&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INDEPENDENT BELARUSIAN JOURNALIST TRIED IN SO-CALLED &apos;EXTREMISM&apos; CASE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The center said Kuchuk, 50, was arrested on Feb. 16 in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, near the Russian Embassy, where he went to lay flowers and light a candle in memory of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose sudden death in a remote Arctic prison was announced that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authorities ordered Kuchuk jailed for successive 15-day stints and then filed criminal charges against him, Viasna said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belarus, Russia&apos;s neighbor with a population of 9.5 million, was rocked by mass protests after a disputed election in August 2020 gave its authoritarian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/lukashenko-signs-law-granting-self-criminal-immunity-life&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Alexander Lukashenko&lt;/a&gt; his sixth term in office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opposition and the West denounced the vote as fraudulent, and a months-long wave of demonstrations rolled through the country. Security forces dispersed the rallies and arrested more than 35,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All prominent opposition figures ended up in jail or in exile abroad. The crackdown has continued, with opposition activists, independent journalists and rights advocates targeted in arrests and raids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuchuk &quot;was unnerving the security forces, he didn&apos;t leave, he didn&apos;t lock himself in the closet and took efforts to start a campaign to gather signatures for the release of political prisoners,&quot; said Anatol Lyabedzka, aide to Belarusian opposition leader in exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His Green Party was liquidated by the Belarusian Supreme Court last July as part of a government purge of political parties ahead of the 2024 parliamentary election. It was once a member of the European Green Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Kuchuk tried to run for a seat in the parliament, but was barred from running. He is the seventh Belarusian party leader behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Viasna, there are some 1,400 political prisoners in the country, including the group&apos;s leader and the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rep-tenney-nominates-trump-nobel-peace-prize-historic-abraham-accords&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; winner Ales Bialiatski.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>White House pressed on whether Biden believes border crossers could be in US plotting terror attack on America</title>
                    
                    <description>Fox News&amp;apos; Peter Doocy asked National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby if President Biden thinks border crossers are in the U.S. plotting terror attack.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The White House on Tuesday answered whether President Biden believes that some of those crossing the border illegally could be in the U.S. plotting a terror attack on the homeland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy asked John Kirby, the U.S. National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, if, as the person in charge of &quot;preventing a terrorist attack in the homeland, does President Biden think that some of these border crossers could be in the United States right now plotting a terrorist attack against Americans?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The president is confident that throughout the interagency – DHS, intelligence community – that we&apos;re doing everything we can to be as vigilant as we can to ensure the safety and security of the American people here at home,&quot; Kirby said at a press briefing, before pivoting to another reporter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doocy had initially referenced how former President Trump is scheduled to appear in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to deliver a speech about what his campaign calls &quot;Biden&apos;s Border Bloodbath.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-biden-orchestrated-legal-challenges-ahead-campaign-stops-battleground-states&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP SAYS BIDEN &apos;ORCHESTRATED&apos; LEGAL CHALLENGES AHEAD OF CAMPAIGN STOPS IN BATTLEGROUND STATES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the speech later Tuesday, Trump is expected to discuss the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/previously-deported-illegal-immigrant-charged-murder-25-year-old-michigan-woman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;killing of Ruby Garcia&lt;/a&gt;, a Michigan woman who was found dead on the side of a Grand Rapids highway on March 22. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police say Garcia was in a romantic relationship with the suspect, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-rip-biden-open-border-policies-illegal-immigrant-accused-of-killing-michigan-woman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Brandon Ortiz-Vite&lt;/a&gt;. He told police he shot her multiple times during an argument before dropping her body on the side of the road and driving off in her red Mazda. Authorities say Ortiz-Vite is a citizen of Mexico and had previously been deported following a drunk driving arrest, according to the Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There’s another case of somebody who is in this country illegally allegedly murdering a young woman, this time in Michigan. Her name is Ruby Garcia. Donald Trump is out there now calling this Biden&apos;s border bloodbath. What do you call it?&quot; Doocy asked during Tuesday’s White House press briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirby said he was not aware of the specifics of the case, calling Garcia’s death &quot;terrible news&quot; and offering the woman’s family thoughts and prayers before deferring to local law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/border-patrol-chief-suggests-jail-time-tougher-consequences-stop-illegal-us-mexico-border-crossings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BORDER PATROL CHIEF SUGGESTS &apos;JAIL TIME,&apos; TOUGHER &apos;CONSEQUENCES&apos; TO STOP ILLEGAL US-MEXICO BORDER CROSSINGS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So, why don&apos;t we let the judicial process play out here before we start making grandiose bumper-sticker comments about what this says about the border?&quot; Kirby added. &quot;And, Peter, to folks that are concerned about border security, the president will be the first one to stand up here and say he agrees that the border does need some security capabilities, that we do need more Border Patrol agents. And all that has to happen is for the speaker to do his job, put that supplemental [bill] on the floor. Let&apos;s get a vote. Let&apos;s get those 1,300 additional Border Patrol agents down there to do their jobs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirby and Doocy proceeded to spar over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/border-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;border supplemental package&lt;/a&gt;, which the White House has repeatedly called on House Speaker Mike Johnson to call the bill to a vote in the lower chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans, meanwhile, have pressed Biden to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-wont-take-executive-action-secure-border-wants-congress-find-fix&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;take executive action&lt;/a&gt; to address the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The bill&apos;s dead,&quot; Doocy said, prompting Kirby to retort, &quot;Says you. When’s the vote?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doocy went on to say, &quot;There are real problems at the border while that bill just languishes, right? The chief of the Border Patrol is saying exactly 140,000 gotaways. If we don&apos;t know who is coming into our country, and we don&apos;t know what their intent is, that is a threat. Does President Biden agree?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The president absolutely believes that along that border, we do have significant national security concerns that have to be met,&quot; Kirby said. &quot;But you said something really good in your question that I loved that … while these concerns are going on, the bill languishes. So, what&apos;s needed? It&apos;s not anything more from the president. What&apos;s needed is for Speaker Johnson to do his job, get that thing on the floor. Let&apos;s get a vote on it. They had a chance and decided not to act because certain people in House Republican world wanted a problem rather than a solution.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Gisele Bündchen shared a cryptic quote on social media, referring to &amp;quot;trauma&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;pain,&amp;quot; as she embarks on a new relationship post-divorce from Tom Brady.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Though she’s been open about her heartbreak over her divorce from Tom Brady, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/gisele-bundchen-nearly-died-freezing-water-during-90s-photo-shoot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Gisele Bündchen&lt;/a&gt; shared a post raising a few eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sports Illustrated model shared a quote from Brazilian writer Wandy Luz, alluding to &quot;pains, traumas, fears&quot; on her Instagram stories Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quote, shared in both Portuguese and English, read, &quot;You look at a person and can’t imagine the story they carry—the pains, traumas, fears, just as we can’t even imagine how strong, capable, and resilient someone is.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It continued, &quot;Behind smiles and glances are achievements and victories; there are people and moments they overcome and dreams and desires to be achieved.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/gisele-bundchen-boyfriend-pictured-first-time-together-since-denied-cheating-tom-brady&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GISELE BÜNDCHEN AND HER BOYFRIEND PICTURED FOR THE FIRST TIME TOGETHER SINCE SHE DENIED CHEATING ON TOM BRADY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There’s so much you’ll never know. So, be kind whenever you can,&quot; it concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Bündchen was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tom-bradys-ex-wife-gisele-bundchen-denies-cheating-allegations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;spotted with her boyfriend,&lt;/a&gt; jiu-jitsui instructor Joaquim Valente, after confirming their romance and denying rumors she had cheated on Brady with Valente.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told The New York Times, &quot;That is a lie.&quot;        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is something that happens to a lot of women who get blamed when they have the courage to leave an unhealthy relationship and are labeled as being unfaithful,&quot; Bündchen added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bündchen also noted, &quot;No one really knows what happens between two people, only the two people in the relationship.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Victoria’s Secret Angel has been speaking more openly about her divorce in the last month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near the end of March, Bündchen told The Wall Street Journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/gisele-bundchens-divorce-from-tom-brady-revealed-she-was-stronger-than-i-thought&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;my life is a little different,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and she tries to focus on positivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued, &quot;When I look back, the biggest, most challenging experiences in my life were all happening for me. They showed me that I was stronger than I thought I was.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

But I think sometimes in life things happen… I feel so blessed because, like, I wouldn&apos;t change anything in my life. I had incredible experiences. I learned so much. I have my children, which are the biggest blessings in my life,&quot; she told Roberts. &quot;I get to learn new things… I&apos;m grateful for all of it. I&apos;m grateful for every lesson.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bündchen and Brady were married for 13 years and share two children, Vivian and Benjamin. Brady also has an older son with his ex, actress Bridget Moynahan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Caroline Thayer contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Christian Soto, 22, who stands accused of killing four people in a Winnebago County, Illinois, rampage, has been denied pretrial release.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/illinois&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;northern Illinois&lt;/a&gt; man charged with killing four people and injuring seven others by stabbing, beating and driving over them has been denied pretrial release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A judge in the city of Rockford ruled Tuesday that Christian Soto must remain in jail pending trial. The judge scheduled an April 15 arraignment for the 22-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/associated-press&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; left a message Tuesday seeking comment from an attorney listed in court records as representing Soto. A woman who identified herself as Soto’s sister last week declined to comment to the AP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities have said Soto was behind a series of frenzied attacks Wednesday at multiple addresses in a Rockford neighborhood, but said they have not determined a motive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Winnebago County coroner identified those killed as 63-year-old Romona Schupbach; 23-year-old Jacob Schupbach; 49-year-old Jay Larson; and 15-year-old Jenna Newcomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Winnebago County&lt;/a&gt; State’s Attorney J. Hanley said Soto told police after his arrest that he had smoked marijuana with Jacob Schupbach and believed the drugs &quot;were laced with an unknown narcotic&quot; that made him paranoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities said Soto first fatally stabbed Schupbach and his mother, then he beat, stabbed and used a truck to run over Larson, who was working as a mail carrier. He next wounded three people inside one home, and beat Newcomb, her sister and a friend with a baseball bat inside another home. The attacks happened within a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities said Winnebago County sheriff deputies arrested Soto as he fled from another home where he had stabbed a woman but had been slowed down by a driver who stopped to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Beverly McCallum, 63, has been convicted of second-degree murder in the 2002 death of Roberto Caraballo, who was found beaten and suffocated in the basement of his Charlotte home.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A woman extradited &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/italy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;from Italy&lt;/a&gt; for the 2002 fatal bludgeoning of her husband in Michigan was convicted of second-degree murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A jury in Eaton County needed only two hours Monday to decide the outcome of the trial against Beverly McCallum, the Lansing State Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberto Caraballo, 37, was suffocated and beaten in the basement of his home in Charlotte, about 105 miles &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/detroit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;northwest of Detroit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/5-wounded-detroit-club-shooting-parking-dispute&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 WOUNDED AT DETROIT CLUB IN SHOOTING OVER PARKING DISPUTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burned remains were found in a metal locker near a blueberry field in western Michigan’s Ottawa County, but the remains were not identified as Caraballo until 2015, more than 10 years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCallum, 63, was arrested in Italy in 2020 and held there for more than two years before being returned to Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutor Doug Lloyd said McCallum wanted to get rid of Caraballo in 2002 after he was released from federal prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Robert being around was cramping her lifestyle,&quot; Lloyd argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defense attorney Timothy Havis told jurors that McCallum didn&apos;t have a role in the killing but was lured into taking a ride to get rid of the remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCallum, however, was implicated at trial by Christopher McMillan, a witness who pleaded guilty to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;second-degree murder&lt;/a&gt; and cooperated with police. He said Caraballo was attacked by McCallum and her daughter, Dineane Ducharme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ducharme, 43, is serving a life prison sentence after being convicted of first-degree murder in 2021. McMillan, 45, is serving a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Woman fatally stabbed in Greek capital after seeking police protection from ex-partner</title>
                    
                    <description>A 28-year-old Greek woman was found murdered outside an Athens police precinct, immediately after requesting protection from an ex-boyfriend.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Greek authorities on Tuesday ordered an urgent investigation into a woman&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;fatal stabbing&lt;/a&gt; outside an Athens police precinct where she had just requested protection from an ex-boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 28-year-old&apos;s death triggered new calls by left-wing opposition parties for femicide — the killing of women or girls with a gender-related motivation — to be recognized as a distinct term in Greece&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;criminal code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minister in charge of the police, Michalis Chrisochoidis, promised a &quot;full, in-depth&quot; investigation of Monday&apos;s killing that occurred a few dozen yards from the Aghii Anargyri police station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/greek-islands-launch-special-visa-program-turkish-visitors-diplomatic-effort-calm-region&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GREEK ISLANDS LAUNCH SPECIAL VISA PROGRAM FOR TURKISH VISITORS IN DIPLOMATIC EFFORT TO CALM REGION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman&apos;s 39-year-old former partner was arrested and was being treated under police guard in a psychiatric hospital after allegedly intentionally stabbing himself following the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What matters now is to fully investigate the incident … and see what the police did or didn’t do,&quot; Chrisochoidis told state ERT television. &quot;This must be done in a very few days, hours even.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A police statement Tuesday said the victim visited the precinct with a friend and reported that her former boyfriend — against whom she had made formal complaints in the past for abusive behavior — had been loitering outside her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the statement, she requested a patrol car to take her home for her protection, but because she declined to make a formal complaint, she was directed to phone the police emergency line to send a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement said she made the call on her way out of the precinct. But &quot;while she was talking to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;police operator&lt;/a&gt; she was suddenly attacked by her former partner, who fatally injured her with a knife.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou expressed shock at the killing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The murder ... yet another femicide, shakes and angers us,&quot; she said in a statement. &quot;It shows ... the urgent responsibility authorities have to fight gender-based violence and crime.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police statement said members of the force are trained to respond to gender-based violence, following protocols &quot;that are constantly updated.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It must be examined to what extent these (protocols) were followed,&quot; Chrisichoidis said. He added that while he supported the criminal code reform requested by opposition parties, that should follow a &quot;serious and calm debate&quot; by legal experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Athens stabbing was the sixth femicide reported in Greece this year. In 2023, 15 were reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Joy Behar sounds off on RFK Jr., says he&apos;s a &apos;dangerous&apos; threat to President Biden</title>
                    
                    <description>Joy Behar argued during &amp;quot;The View&amp;quot; on Tuesday that RFK Jr. was a &amp;quot;threat&amp;quot; to President Biden because he&amp;apos;s a Kennedy, and said he is &amp;quot;very dangerous.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The View&quot; co-host Joy Behar sounded off on Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Tuesday, arguing he is &quot;very dangerous,&quot; and a &quot;threat&quot; to President Biden&apos;s re-election chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behar said RFK Jr. was &quot;very dangerous,&quot; and the show played a clip from his interview with CNN&apos;s Erin Burnett on Monday. Kennedy argued President Biden was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rfk-jr-says-biden-much-worse-threat-to-democracy-than-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;more of a threat&lt;/a&gt; to democracy than former President Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;First of all, he’s a threat, I think more to Biden, just because of his name. That people out there, they’re not really looking into things. I think they think, &apos;oh Kennedy, Democrat, yeah I&apos;ll vote for him.&apos; Meanwhile, he is a conspiracy theorist, anti-science. His whole family is voting for Biden and this type of dangerous rhetoric that Biden is a bigger threat to democracy than the man who wanted to throw over the government, overthrow the government,&quot; Behar continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-host Sara Haines said Kennedy was &quot;wrong in what he was saying,&quot; and said Kennedy should be mad at Instagram, not Biden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/libertarian-party-chair-rfk-jr-nomination-mutually-beneficial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIBERTARIAN PARTY CHAIR SAYS RFK JR. NOMINATION COULD BE ‘MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He&apos;s also wrong in what he’s saying. So he&apos;s talking about the First Amendment, it being the most important one, and that someone&apos;s squashing speech on social media, but President Biden is not responsible for private social media companies. The First Amendment is for the government, it does not apply, necessarily, to private companies who decide to ban you,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haines said Kennedy had been repeating debunked studies and theories on social media platforms, and argued he continues to lie about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behar chimed in again and said RFK Jr. is a &quot;liar.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can make the argument that President Biden is much worse,&quot; Kennedy said during the CNN interview on Monday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt; previously reported. &quot;And the reason for that is President Biden is the first candidate in history, the first president in history that has used the federal agencies to censor political speech or censor his opponent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rfk-jr-says-he-meets-ballot-threshold-another-state&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;RFK JR SAYS HE MEETS BALLOT THRESHOLD IN ANOTHER KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behar sounded the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/joy-behar-demands-rfk-jr-defend-potentially-spoiling-election-biden-delusion-has-destroye-country&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;alarm on RFK Jr.&lt;/a&gt; in March and suggested he would destroy the election and spoil it for Biden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Someone has to ask him why are you doing this? Why do you want to destroy the election and hand it to Trump if possible?&quot; Behar scolded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He’s a Kennedy. His forefathers are rolling over in their graves. His own family is telling him — we already have one clown in the race. Do we need two of them?&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haines pushed back by arguing she didn&apos;t think Kennedy was purposefully trying to &quot;ruin the election,&quot; but was trying to appeal to voters like herself who think there should be room for a third-party candidate in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I just don&apos;t think it&apos;s this election,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behar insisted that Kenndy&apos;s candidacy would destroy the country if it helped former President Trump get re-elected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, I think many times delusion has destroyed a country and that’s what we’re dealing with here with this. The polls are too close,&quot; she feared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Kristine Parks contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Biden&apos;s new green big rig standards could bankrupt small business, &apos;Shark Tank&apos;s&apos; Kevin O&apos;Leary says</title>
                    
                    <description>The Environmental Protection Agency released stringent new emissions standards for big-rigs that investor Kevin O&amp;apos;Leary warned could have negative economic reverberations.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration&apos;s stringent emissions standards for big rig trucks are based on technology that doesn&apos;t exist in a broad enough capacity and could cripple the small business economy, &quot;Shark Tank&quot; investor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/mr-wonderful-doubles-down-tiktok-offer-warns-suitors-algorithm-user-retention-challenges&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kevin O&apos;Leary told Fox News&lt;/a&gt; on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;told &quot;The Story&quot;&lt;/a&gt; the emissions mandate&apos;s timing is impossible to meet right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We talk about this quite a bit in the sector of the economy where [there are] 5 to 500 employees, small businesses that use a lot of transportation services for consumer goods and services. There&apos;s no way this is going to work on that schedule,&quot; O&apos;Leary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EPA, under administrator Michael Regan, announced &quot;technology-neutral and performance-based&quot; emissions regulations Friday that will apply to model-year 2027 trucks and thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bidens-budget-makes-claims-cutting-debt-1984-economist-says-assault-us-business&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN&apos;S $8T BUDGET MAKES CLAIMS OF CUTTING DEBT LAUGHABLE, ECONOMIST SAYS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Building on our recently finalized rule for light- and medium-duty vehicles, EPA’s strong and durable vehicle standards respond to the urgency of the climate crisis by making deep cuts in emissions from the transportation sector,&quot; Regan said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-cracks-down-on-diesel-trucks-in-bid-to-fight-climate-change-reduce-emissions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The new rules could lead to&lt;/a&gt; half of vocational trucks, and a quarter of long-haul tractor-trailers produced in 2032 being electric-powered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The batteries don&apos;t exist for this,&quot; O&apos;Leary said Monday, claiming current EV-powered big rigs tend to average a maximum of 200 miles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&apos;s not the definition of a long-haul transport… [It] won&apos;t work. The grid is woefully underserved.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While O&apos;Leary said he didn&apos;t want to be a pessimist on the advent of the fledgling EV technology, he predicted the EPA will have to adjust its standards in the near-term or oversee a debilitating hit to the U.S. economy because of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He predicted the mandate will fall short of its goals within three years and that if it is not adjusted, &quot;you basically bankrupt where 62% of jobs are created in America: small business.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/hardcore-pawn-star-economy-clientele-pawning-items-make-it-through-week&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘HARDCORE PAWN’ STAR SAYS ECONOMY LEADING CLIENTELE TO PAWNING ITEMS TO ‘MAKE IT THROUGH THE WEEK’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We don&apos;t have the tech,&quot; he added. &quot;So let&apos;s everybody wake up and smell the lithium batteries for a while – they don&apos;t work yet,&quot; O&apos;Leary argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trucking trade leader also told FOX Business the price of trucks is likely to triple if the mandate continues as-is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[That&apos;s] assuming they can get these electric trucks. They&apos;re not going to have a place to plug in. They&apos;re not going to have the power flowing through the infrastructure to charge,&quot; American Trucking Association president Chris Spear told FOX Business&apos; Grady Trimble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They&apos;re going to be out of business,&quot; he said of smaller trucking outfits in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some federal lawmakers praised the new emissions rule, with one Democrat calling them a &quot;win-win for the planet and public health.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://FOXNEWS.COM/DOWNLOAD&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It supports the United States in reaching President Biden’s ambitious climate goals while cleaning up the air we breathe,&quot; said Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., in a statement released by the EPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today’s rule will be especially critical for disadvantaged communities located near freight corridors that are overburdened by air pollution, as well as the millions of children who are currently riding dirty diesel buses to school each day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Missing Sebastian Rogers: Tennessee police say &apos;inaccurate&apos; information online has caused &apos;distraction&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Tennessee authorities searching for Sebastian Rogers, a missing teen with autism, are warning of &amp;apos;inaccurate&amp;apos; information being spread online and causing &amp;apos;distraction.&amp;apos;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tennessee authorities on Tuesday cautioned the public against sharing &quot;inaccurate&quot; information being shared online related to the search for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/missing-persons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;missing teen Sebastian Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, which they say has caused a &quot;distraction&quot; in their investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sumner County Sheriff&apos;s Office issued an Amber Alert for Sebastian, a 15-year-old boy with autism, after he was last seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in the area of Stafford Court&lt;/a&gt; in Hendersonville on Feb. 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We do want to caution … there are some social media elements out there [that] report to have information that is direct from the investigation. I just want to reiterate that that is not the case. Some of the information that is being provided on some of the social media channels is inaccurate, incomplete,&quot; Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesperson Susan Niland said during a Tuesday press conference. &quot;We don&apos;t want this to damage the investigation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that &quot;rumors and speculation and theories&quot; on social media regarding Sebastian&apos;s disappearance has &quot;caused a bit of a distraction&quot; and &quot;taken away time and effort from what the agencies need to be doing. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/cajun-navy-calls-search-missing-autistic-teen-sebastian-rogers-threats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAJUN NAVY CALLS OFF SEARCH FOR MISSING AUTISTIC TEEN SEBASTIAN ROGERS AMID THREATS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sebastian&apos;s mother, Katie Proudfoot, and stepfather, Chris Proudfoot, decided to leave town following his disappearance due to threats, speculation about their involvement began to spread online, but Niland said his parents have been &quot;cooperative throughout&quot; the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They have pretty much done whatever &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; has asked of them. At this point, we don&apos;t have any evidence,&quot; Niland said of Sebastian&apos;s parents. &quot;There is not any kind of an indication that there is a criminal element involved. But we are keeping options open. We don&apos;t know what has happened. We don&apos;t know where Sebastian is right now. So we are pursuing any and all avenues.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/missing-tennessee-teen-sebastian-rogers-mother-defends-leaving-neighborhood-after-threatening-messages&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MISSING TENNESSEE TEEN SEBASTIAN ROGERS&apos; MOTHER DEFENDS LEAVING NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER ‘THREATENING’ MESSAGES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 15-year-old apparently left home with bare feet and a flashlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katie previously told Fox News that she overheard noise coming from Sebastian&apos;s room on the evening of Feb. 25 and told him to keep it down. The next morning, he was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/tennessee-police-searching-kentucky-landfill-connection-disappearance-missing-autistic-teen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TENNESSEE POLICE SEARCHING KENTUCKY LANDFILL IN CONNECTION WITH DISAPPEARANCE OF MISSING AUTISTIC TEEN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the teenager&apos;s disappearance, Katie drove about three hours away from home to meet up with her husband and Sebastian&apos;s stepfather, prompting some to wonder why she would travel so far from the area where her son was last seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are posting fliers every direction we can. But at the same time, there were quite a bit of people that were sending some very threatening and hateful messages to us. They&apos;re following us. They&apos;re driving past our house at all hours of the day or night, disturbing the neighborhood, and the neighborhood is very upset and concerned. They&apos;re worried about their safety at this point,&quot; Katie said, adding that she felt that leaving the neighborhood would help calm things down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/tiktokers-find-great-lead-riley-strain-nashville-vanishing-city-hunts-missing-student-friend&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TIKTOKERS FIND ‘GREAT LEAD’ IN RILEY STRAIN&apos;S NASHVILLE VANISHING AS CITY HUNTS FOR MISSING STUDENT: FRIEND&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seth Rogers, Sebastian&apos;s father, told FOX 17 Nashville in a raw interview posted on March 28 that he has hope his son is still alive, and he is searching for the 15-year-old &quot;everywhere.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that he recently learned Child Protective Services (CPS) had visited Katie&apos;s house before, and he had not been informed of the visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t understand why the state dropped the ball on that one,&quot; he told the outlet, adding that he learned about the CPS visit from a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators are asking the public to keep an eye out for anything unusual and contact the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sumner County Emergency Communications&lt;/a&gt; Center at 615-451-3838 or the TBI at 1-800-TBI-FIND with any information that could be helpful in the search for Sebastian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities have received a total of 314 tips related to the search for Sebastian as of Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>29 migrants rescued from boat off Greek island&apos;s coast</title>
                    
                    <description>29 migrants were rescued from the Mediterranean Sea on Tuesday in a crippled boat south of the Greek island of Crete, according to regional authorities.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A group of 29 migrants was rescued Tuesday off a crippled boat in the Mediterranean Sea south of Crete, Greek authorities said, on an increasingly busy migration route from North Africa &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to Europe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A coast guard statement said the boat was located about 27 miles south of Gavdos, a small island off Crete&apos;s southern coast, by a passing merchant ship after passengers made a distress call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/8-killed-vehicle-carrying-suspected-migrants-veers-albanian-river&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 KILLED AFTER VEHICLE CARRYING SUSPECTED MIGRANTS VEERS INTO ALBANIAN RIVER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The migrants were being ferried to southern Crete. No information was immediately available on their health, nationality or port of embarkation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southern Crete and Gavdos, 27 nautical miles off the island, have seen a substantial increase in migrant arrivals this year. Most leave from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/middle-east&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;eastern Libyan&lt;/a&gt; port of Tobruk, having paid smuggling gangs up to $5,000 each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/united-nations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; data, more than 1,200 people have reached the area this year, out of a total of about 9,600 who arrived in Greece by sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, another 74 people were rescued off a boat south of Gavdos, which is about 11 square miles in size and has just a few dozen residents in the winter. Two of the people on the vessel were later arrested on suspicion of belonging to a migrant-smuggling gang.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>A new national survey released Tuesday finds that the number of Americans who say Jews face &amp;quot;a lot&amp;quot; of antisemitism in society today has doubled.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The percentage of Americans saying that Jews are facing &quot;a lot&quot; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/anti-semitism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;discrimination in society&lt;/a&gt; has doubled in the last three years, according to a new survey released Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey, conducted by the Pew Research Center in February, found that the number jumped from 20% in 2021 to 40% today. The respondents were from among a nationally representative sample of 12,693 U.S. adults, which included &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;American Jews and Muslims&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most U.S. Jews and Muslims say they have felt discrimination against their respective groups, with 89% of Jews and 70% of Muslims saying that feeling has increased since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, 72% of Jewish Americans say there is &quot;a lot&quot; of discrimination against Jews in society today, while 67% of Muslim Americans say the same about discrimination against their group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/soldier-gravely-injured-oct-7-terror-attack-found-faith-offers-hope-others&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISRAELI SOLDIER GRAVELY INJURED IN OCT 7 TERROR ATTACK FINDS NEW FAITH, OFFERS HOPE TO OTHERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A smaller majority of 57% of American Jews surveyed say there is &quot;a lot&quot; of discrimination against Muslims in society, while only 17% of Muslim Americans say the same about discrimination against Jews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following months of protests in major cities and some college campuses across the country, the survey found that most respondents say that speech supporting or opposing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/middle-east&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Israeli and Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; statehood should exist but that calls for violence against Jews or Muslims should not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/jewish-nyu-student-reinstated-voted-out-leadership-position-condemning-hamas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JEWISH NYU STUDENT REINSTATED AFTER BEING VOTED OUT OF LEADERSHIP POSITION FOR CONDEMNING HAMAS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey comes as Jewish and Muslim civil rights and advocacy groups have reported large &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/nearly-half-us-jews-altered-behavior-avoid-antisemitism-survey-finds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;increases in harassment,&lt;/a&gt; bias and physical attacks against their members in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple states have pushed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bill-legally-defining-antisemitism-passes-florida-senate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;define antisemitism in law&lt;/a&gt; after the Hamas terrorist attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in Israel on Oct. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Firefighters came to the rescue of two people who were trapped under a bridge early Tuesday when the waters of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/this-day-history-march-28-1866-first-us-ambulance-service-rolls-through-cincinnati&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; river began rising, and forecasters warned more severe weather was headed to the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/ohio-dad-could-still-face-death-penalty-massacre-3-sons-judge-tosses-confession&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OHIO DAD COULD STILL FACE DEATH PENALTY IN MASSACRE OF 3 SONS AFTER JUDGE TOSSES CONFESSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two people were sleeping under the bridge around 8:45 a.m. when the Scioto River started to rise, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/ohio-travel-guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Columbus&lt;/a&gt; Fire Department reported. While the pair were never directly in the water, the flooding prevented them from returning to the shore, so a fire department boat was sent to rescue them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No injuries were reported. The couple&apos;s names were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A flood warning has been issued by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/authorities-escort-cars-around-part-californias-highway-1-crumbled-ocean&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; for parts of the river that are expected to reach flood stage Wednesday morning. A flood watch also remains in effect for the Olentangy River near Worthington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forecasters also warned that severe storms which could potentially spawn tornadoes and more flooding were expected to move into central Ohio on Tuesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Hawks&apos; Quin Snyder shrugs off heated confrontation with Bogdan Bogdanovic, says two &apos;are in a great place&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>The heated verbal exchange between Bogdan Bogdanović and Quin Snyder may have left some observers with concerns, but the coach and player simply downplayed the situation.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta Hawks have just seven regular season games remaining on their schedule and appear to be heading for a third consecutive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba-playoffs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NBA Play-In Tournament&lt;/a&gt; berth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/atlanta-hawks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Hawks&lt;/a&gt; defeated the Chicago Bulls on Monday to earn their 35th win of the season. But, the tenth-seeded Hawks 113-101 victory was overshadowed by a late-game confrontation between Atlanta&apos;s coach and one of its key players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bogdanovic became noticeably frustrated and spilled a water bottle in the fourth quarter. The 31-year-old guard then approached Synder and a tense exchange ensued.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is unclear what exactly sparked Bogdanovic&apos;s gripe or what he expressed to Snyder, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the NBA&lt;/a&gt; veteran guard later attempted to downplay the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are doing this almost every other minute or we are verbally fighting all the time, which is normal. That means we both care and everyone cares. ... Quin is my guy, for sure. And, he was pushing me through the whole year. We had this like, fights, little fights. It&apos;s normal that happens,&quot; Bogdanović told reporters after the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lakers-lebron-james-hints-nba-days-nearing-end-dropping-40-points-nets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LAKERS&apos; LEBRON JAMES HINTS AT NBA DAYS NEARING END AFTER DROPPING 40 POINTS ON NETS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder shared similar sentiments when he spoke about the state of his relationship with Bogdanovic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bogi was terrific. And he and I are in a great place. Better than good. Great,&quot; Snyder, who is in his first full season as the Hawks head coach, said in a postgame press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bogdanovic&apos;s 20 points led the Hawks in scoring during Monday&apos;s game against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/chicago-bulls&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Bulls&lt;/a&gt;. His stat line also included four rebounds and six assists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlanta was enjoying a considerable lead with less than two minutes left in regulation when the heated exchange began. Bogdanovic and other Hawks starters were on the bench at the time, as the game&apos;s outcome appeared to be fairly certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder did seem to try and ease the tension by walking over to hug Bogdanovc almost immediately after teammates pulled him away from his coach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three-time NBA All-Star Trae Young has not played since Feb. 23 and continues to recover from a finger injury.  But, Dejounte Murray&apos;s strong play helped the Hawks win five of their last six games. The Bulls currently sit in the ninth spot in the Eastern Conference standings and have clinched a spot in the play-in tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Danish researchers Henrik Bringsøe and Niels Poul Dreyer captured on video — potentially for the first time in the natural habitat — footage of two snakes battling one another for a meal.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In what is believed to be the first encounter captured on video, two wild snakes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/regions/south-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in Colombia&lt;/a&gt; were caught fighting over a meal recently in their natural habitats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danish researchers Henrik Bringsøe and Niels Poul Dreyer published a study on March 22 in Herpetozoa, an open-access journal, highlighting the startling phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two red-tailed coral snakes were caught on video struggling to take a caecilian (which looks a lot like an earthworm) from the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/rare-two-headed-snake-undergoes-surgery-missouri&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RARE TWO-HEADED SNAKE UNDERGOES SURGERY IN MISSOURI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/odd-news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;incredible scene&lt;/a&gt; marked &quot;the first documented instance of kleptoparasitism within the Elapidae family in the wild,&quot; Viral Press reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many snakes are difficult to study in the wild because of their &quot;secretive habits,&quot; researcher Bringsøe noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Kleptoparasitism, a phenomenon in which one predator steals food from another, is well-documented across various animal species but has rarely been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/reptiles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;observed among snakes&lt;/a&gt; in their natural habitats,&quot; Viral Press also reorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tug-of-war action between the two Micrurus mipartitus snakes showcases the dominance of the reptiles both over the amphibian and each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/snake-discovery-explorers-identify-new-species-of-anaconda-biggest-all&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNAKE DISCOVERY AS EXPLORERS IDENTIFY NEW SPECIES OF ANACONDA THAT&apos;S THE &apos;BIGGEST OF ALL&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elapid snakes are known for being a formidable force in the animal kingdom. This includes other species such as mambas, cobras, kraits, taipans, tiger snakes, death adders, sea snakes and coral snakes, Bringsøe told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impressive display took place in the rainforests of Valle del Cauca in western Colombia, the news organization noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the footage continues, one snake bites the body of the other — a moment believed to be attributed to the struggle and not &quot;deliberate aggression.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After working hard to take hold of its prize, the losing coral snake lets go of the caecilian — and the winner grabs the meal before fleeing the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringsøe and Dreyer noted that this behavior has been observed in captive settings — but two or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/australian-girl-swings-large-snake-several-times-rescue-pet-guinea-pig-video&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;more snakes battling&lt;/a&gt; one another for a single meal in the wild has not been documented, Viral Press said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Snakes in captivity do that often when only one prey is offered in a terrarium with two or more snakes. But it is rather surprising that it has not been observed more frequently in the wild,&quot; Bringsøe shared with Viral Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery will serve as research for those who continue to look into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the wild behaviors&lt;/a&gt; of these elusive creatures in their natural habitats, those connected to the incident indicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;An important thing for me when I study snakes and other reptiles in the wild is that you will have to devote much time [to] this work. Then I may now and then observe behavior, which is unusual or even unique,&quot; Bringsøe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have already been in contact with several herpetologists who realize that we should focus more on this interesting behavior,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It may well occur more frequently than we think. So, I think one positive consequence for the future is that our paper can increase the awareness of behavioral studies of snakes: They are important for our understanding of these creatures, which are in several ways still poorly understood. Kleptoparasitism is just one fascinating element of complex serpent behavior.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Peruvian archbishop has resigned from position as the Vatican investigates disturbing reports</title>
                    
                    <description>After suing two journalists for reports on sexual abuse and financial corruption, a Peruvian archbishop, José Eguren, has resigned in the midst of a Vatican investigation.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/roman-catholic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Peruvian archbishop&lt;/a&gt; who sued two journalists over their reports about sexual abuse and financial corruption in his religious movement, Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, has resigned amid a Vatican investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pope Francis on Tuesday accepted the resignation of Piura Archbishop José Eguren. At 67, he is several years shy of the normal retirement age for bishops of 75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vatican didn’t say why Eguren was retiring early in its brief announcement. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/religion/vatican&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Vatican&lt;/a&gt; last year began an in-depth investigation of abuse and financial wrongdoing in the Peruvian-based Sodalitium to which Eguren belongs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/why-say-vaticans-process-dealing-sex-abuse-further-harm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY SOME SAY THE VATICAN&apos;S PROCESS FOR DEALING WITH SEX ABUSE DOES FURTHER HARM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vatican has had its eye on Sodalitium, which has chapters across South America and the U.S., for over a decade. In 2017, a report commissioned by the group’s new leadership determined that its founder, Luis Fernando Figari, sodomized his recruits and subjected them to humiliating psychological and other sexual abuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those abuses first came to light in a 2015, thanks to reporting by Peruvian journalists Pedro Salinas and Paola Ugaz. In addition to Figari&apos;s own abuses, their reporting exposed the alleged forced eviction of peasants on lands in Eguren’s diocese by a Sodalitium-linked real estate developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Eguren sued them for defamation, seeking about $100,000 total and jail time for what he alleged was damage to his honor and reputation. He dropped the aggravated defamation lawsuit in 2019, after he came under criticism from even within the Peruvian church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the Vatican sent its two top &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sex abuse investigators&lt;/a&gt; to Peru to investigate not only allegations of sexual and psychological abuses still in the Sodalitium, but also allegations of financial corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report’s details have not been released, but Salinas suggested Eguren’s removal was directly related to the Vatican investigation and a possible sign that other action could be forthcoming. Salinas himself was a victim of Figari and has been at the forefront of trying to hold Sodalitium accountable; Ugaz for her part met with Francis in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is unprecedented and should be interpreted as the preamble to something bigger: the possible suppression of the Sodalitium,&quot; Salinas said in a message to The Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eguren made no mention of the investigation in a statement posted on the Piura archdiocesan website that announced his resignation and the nomination of temporary successor, Monsignor Guillermo Elías Millares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/vatican-investigation-former-australian-bishop-accused-child-sex-abuse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VATICAN EXAMINING FINDINGS OF INVESTIGATION OF FORMER AUSTRALIAN BISHOP ACCUSED OF CHILD SEX ABUSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eguren said that at all times he had &quot;tried to fulfill the mission entrusted to me, with justice, honesty and fidelity to the teachings of the church, with special concern for the good of the poorest and most needy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He quoted Pope Benedict XVI as saying that &quot;loving &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/faith&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the church&lt;/a&gt; also means having the courage to make difficult and painful decisions, always keeping in mind the good of the church and not of ourselves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figari founded the SCV, as the Sodalitium is known, in 1971, as a lay community to recruit &quot;soldiers for God.&quot; It was one of several Catholic societies born as a conservative reaction to the left-leaning liberation theology movement that swept through Latin America starting in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victims first complained to the Lima archdiocese about Figari&apos;s perversions and abuses in May 2011. The archdiocese says it turned the case over to the Vatican immediately, but neither the local church nor the Holy See took concrete action until Salinas’ book, &quot;Half Monks, Half Soldiers,&quot; was published in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sodalitium has said in the past that it was collaborating with the Vatican investigation. It has quoted Figari as saying he is innocent, but has called the allegations in &quot;Half Monks, Half Soldiers&quot; plausible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klaus Mäkelä, 28, will take over as music director for the Chicago Symphony in 2027&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore accused President Biden of supporting Israel&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;ethnic cleansing&amp;quot; in Gaza but lamented that he&amp;apos;s the only person to &amp;quot;stop Trump.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Documentary filmmaker and left-wing activist Michael Moore accused President Biden of being the &quot;number one arms dealer&quot; for Israel’s &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; of Palestinians in Gaza and demanded that he cut off the U.S. weapons support for the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore made the claim during the Monday episode of his &quot;Rumble&quot; podcast, noting the predicament of supporting someone who has to beat former President Trump in the upcoming presidential election that also supports the &quot;slaughter&quot; in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore said, &quot;It’s been just an awful thing for all of us to be witness to. We’d like to think about it because our president, the one that has to stop Trump, from winning in November, is the number one financial backer and the number one arms dealer for the state of Israel.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/dearborn-mayor-biden-camps-trip-michigan-dehumanizing-purely-political-means&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DEARBORN MAYOR SAYS BIDEN CAMP&apos;S TRIP TO MICHIGAN WAS &apos;DEHUMANIZING,&apos; PURELY FOR &apos;POLITICAL MEANS&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So what do we do with that?&quot; he asked. Moore went on to state that Biden is &quot;the only one in the whole entire world&quot; who can stop the war by ordering arms to stop going to Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president &quot;has the power to stop this, say, within the next hour, literally by just turning off the faucet, pulling the plug,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;the only one in the whole entire world that has the power to stop this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore, a longtime liberal activist and Democratic Party voter who pulled the lever for Biden in 2020, has been a strong critic of Biden’s Israel policy since Oct. 7. The filmmaker recently expressed support for the &quot;uncommitted&quot; vote in the Michigan Democratic primary this year, during which around 100,000 voters concerned about the Palestinians&apos; plight, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rashida-tlaib-proud-not-vote-biden-michigan-democratic-primary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;voted &quot;uncommitted&quot;&lt;/a&gt; as an act of defiance to the president. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-moore-rips-president-biden-over-gaza-claims-working-against-democrats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;recent appearance&lt;/a&gt; on MSNBC, Moore praised the uncommitted vote, saying it was done to &quot;save Biden from himself&quot; so that he wakes up and stops funding a &quot;massacre&quot; before he loses re-election because of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-biden-problem-mi-2020-voters-turn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MSNBC WARNS BIDEN ‘HAS A PROBLEM’ IN MI AS HIS 2020 VOTERS TURN ON HIM: NOT ‘STUPID ENOUGH TO ELECT YOU AGAIN’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told MSNBC host Ayman Mohyeldin that Biden &quot;is essentially guaranteeing that thousands and thousands of Americans are going to stay home and not vote on Election Day. Because they’re not going to vote for [Donald] Trump. But this is how Trump could win.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his podcast this week, Moore addressed Biden directly, urging him to reflect of what he needs to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You know who you are and what you have to do…. You must have thought about it during Mass on Easter. Public opinion is completely against this ethnic cleansing,&quot; Moore said. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>President Andrés Manuel López Obrador mourns the death of 2 party candidates that were killed outside Celaya only days after starting their campaigns.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/location-mexico&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mexico&apos;s president&lt;/a&gt; said Tuesday that he was hurt by the killing of a mayoral candidate just hours after she requested protection and started campaigning. A city council candidate who was wounded in the same attack on Monday also died, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/mexico-presidential-candidate-move-closer-us-leftist-opponent-prefers-cuba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Andrés Manuel López Obrador &lt;/a&gt;said the killing of his own party&apos;s candidates &quot;hurts a lot,&quot; but he did not announce any increase in security for politicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidate Bertha Gaytán was gunned down on a street in a town just outside the city of Celaya, in the north-central state of Guanajuato. She had just launched her campaign for Celaya mayor on Monday and acknowledged she had asked for protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-reacts-mexican-president-20-billion-demand-biden-admin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP REACTS TO MEXICAN PRESIDENT&apos;S $20 BILLION DEMAND FROM BIDEN ADMIN: &apos;I WOULDN&apos;T GIVE HIM 10 CENTS&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City council candidate Adrián Guerrero, wounded in the same attack, died on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These events are very regrettable, because these are people are fighting to defend democracy, they&apos;re out on the street, face to face,&quot; López Obrador said at his daily news briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The killings was the latest in the increasingly bloody runup to Mexico’s June 2 elections. At least 15 candidates have been killed since the start of 2024 — and expressions of regret have become routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one immediately claimed responsibility for the killing but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/mexican-cartel-violence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mexico’s drug cartels&lt;/a&gt; have often focused assassination attempts on mayors and mayoral candidates, in a bid to control local police or extort money from municipal governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slayings have prompted the government to provide bodyguards or bulletproof cars for some, but candidates for municipal positions — while the most endangered — are the last in line for security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, as Gaytán was walking down a street, shouting &quot;Morena!,&quot; gunshots rang out and she crumpled to the pavement, according to a video posted on social media. The footage then shows people running and falling down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guerrero was part of a small group that was walking with Gaytán. It wasn&apos;t immediately clear if anyone else was wounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/mexico-president-baltimore-bridge-collapse-shows-migrants-do-not-deserve-treated&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEXICO PRESIDENT SAYS BALTIMORE BRIDGE COLLAPSE SHOWS MIGRANTS &apos;DO NOT DESERVE TO BE TREATED AS THEY ARE&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The people are with us, they watch out for us, but of course we are going to have security provisions,&quot; Gaytán had said shortly before she was killed, noting a request had been made through her Morena party. &quot;Let&apos;s see if we get some kind of answer today.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leadership of López Obrador’s Morena party issued a statement, calling the killings &quot;cowardly,&quot; and calling for an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Security Secretary Rosa Icela Rodríguez said Tuesday the government has taken on the commitment to respond to protection requests within 72 hours. She said over 100 candidates nationwide have asked for protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guanajuato has for some time had the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;highest number of homicides&lt;/a&gt; of any state in Mexico, and Celaya is arguably the most dangerous place, per capita, to be a police officer in North America. At least 34 police officers have been killed in this city of 500,000 people in the last three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Guanajuato state, with its population just over 6 million, more police were shot to death in 2023 — about 60 — than in all of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state has been wracked for years by violent turf battles between the Jalisco drug cartel and the homegrown Santa Rosa de Lima gang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Violence against politicians is widespread in Mexico. Over the weekend, the mayor of Churumuco, a town in the neighboring state of Michoacan, was shot to death at a taco restaurant in the state capital, Morelia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late February in another town in Michoacan, two mayoral hopefuls were shot to death within hours of each other.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Norwegian Cruise Line forced an 80-year-old woman, who suffered a stroke and possible heart attack, to &quot;medically disembark&quot; on an African island and &quot;left her to die,&quot; her family said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was on Wednesday, March 27, and the cruise line never called Julie Lenkoff&apos;s emergency contacts and had one conversation with the family between Wednesday and Monday without providing any answers, her family said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, two days later, on March 29, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;six Americans&lt;/a&gt; and two Australian passengers were stranded on the same African island of São Tomé by Norwegian Cruise Line after their tour guide-led excursion ran late, and the ship&apos;s captain wouldn&apos;t let them board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jay and Jill Campbell, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/south-carolina&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; couple, were among the group of eight left behind. &quot;They&apos;re heroes,&quot; Lenkoff&apos;s son-in-law, Kurt Gies, told Fox News Digital. &quot;They saved our mother.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/americans-stranded-norwegian-cruise-line-after-island-excursion-left-without-money-vital-meds-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;AMERICANS STRANDED BY NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE, LEFT WITHOUT MONEY, VITAL MEDS: REPORT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities on the island told the group that another American was left behind without money or ID, according to Gies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s when the Campbells found out Lenkoff was in some medical facility, and took it upon themselves to pay medical bills, food, a hotel and connect her with her family, Gies said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was like our mother didn&apos;t exist,&quot; said Gies, calling the cruise line&apos;s lone statement issued over the weekend &quot;false propaganda that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/cruises&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Norwegian Cruise Line&lt;/a&gt; is pushing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/warning-cruise-passengers-sexual-assaults-hit-new-high-2023-sailings-fbi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WARNING FOR CRUISE PASSENGERS AS SEXUAL ASSAULTS HIT NEW HIGH IN 2023: FBI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The bottom line is Julie Lenkoff was not part of the group of people who were late getting back to the ship,&quot; he said. &quot;They consistently lumped her into the rest of the group as being late to the ship all while not taking any responsibility for her care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All they did is send her to a local clinic who completely misdiagnosed her condition, releasing her to fend for herself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They didn&apos;t need to help her. They&apos;re scared to death, trying to get back to the ship, and they could&apos;ve easily walked away,&quot; Gies said. &quot;Instead, they took on a complete stranger and made sure she was safe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/mom-american-bahamas-sex-attack-says-daughter-texted-weve-been-raped&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;EXCLUSIVE: MOM OF AMERICANS IN BAHAMAS SEX ATTACK REVEALS DAUGHTER&apos;S HEART-STOPPING TEXT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Campbells and the six other passengers, including a pregnant Delaware couple, sorted through their own debacle about how to catch up with the ship, they worked with Gies and his wife to get Lenkoff back to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best of all bad options, Gies said, was a 30-hour flight from São Tomé to Lisbon, Portugal, to Toronto to Stanford Hospital in California &quot;that no one was sure she would even survive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lenkoff, described by her family as &quot;the toughest, most independent woman,&quot; made it home and was admitted into the hospital, where she was still in doctors&apos; care Monday night while Gies spoke to Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said she&apos;s doing better, but she couldn&apos;t see while she was in Africa and had trouble with her right side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenkoff, a visitor to 120 countries who can speak 10 languages, resorted to French while she was in the medical facility on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/africa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;African island,&lt;/a&gt; and they couldn&apos;t understand her and didn&apos;t even know she was an American, Gies said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/norwegian-cruise-lines-security-guard-used-size-strength-attacked-passenger-lawsuit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINES SECURITY GUARD ‘USED HIS SIZE AND STRENGTH’ AND ATTACKED PASSENGER: LAWSUIT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was treated and released about 24 hours later, according to Gies, who said that&apos;s when she was &quot;luckily&quot; cared for by the Campbells and the rest of the stranded group of eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;SHE IS BACK AND SAFE!!!! Having an EKG right now,&quot; Lenkoff&apos;s daughter, Lana Lenkoff Wilken-Gies, wrote on Facebook shortly after 2 a.m. Monday. &quot;She is definitely much more like her old self! Getting better everyday! Thank you for all of your prayers!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lana and Kurt&apos;s &quot;relaxing&quot; Easter trip to enjoy the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;California sun&lt;/a&gt; was interrupted by the cruise debacle and days of radio silence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the company&apos;s original weekend statement to news outlets about the stranded eight made no mention of Lenkoff&apos;s situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/nurse-helping-americans-alleged-bahamas-attack-scared-what-she-saw-couldve-been-daughters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NURSE HELPING AMERICANS IN ALLEGED BAHAMAS ATTACK WAS ‘SCARED’ BY WHAT SHE SAW: ‘COULD’VE BEEN MY DAUGHTERS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They (Norwegian Cruise Line) originally said, ‘Sorry. There’s nothing we can do,&apos; and that was it,&quot; Gies said when they first made contact with the cruise line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They had no answers to what happened, why her emergency contacts weren&apos;t called, who&apos;s taking care of her, where she is.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only ones who cared were the Campbells, said Gies, who called them &quot;heroes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This whole situation, we saw the two sides of humanity. Jill and Jay saved our mom when they didn&apos;t have to. But a mega-corporation with all the funds to help our mom and bring her home did nothing. They couldn&apos;t even give us answers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenkoff had a goal of seeing 130 countries, and saved up for this $20,000 trip before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;COVID shut down travel.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She was so excited about this,&quot; he said. &quot;She lives to travel, but this is it. It was her last trip.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gies and his wife were furious when Norwegian Cruise Line did not acknowledge Lenkoff for days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norwegian Cruise Line released a statement over the weekend that said they left the Campbells, a pregnant Delaware woman and her husband, and four other passengers because they returned late from their excursion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the ship was still on the island and the island&apos;s Coast Guard brought the passengers to the ship, it&apos;s technically Norwegian Cruise Line&apos;s right to deny them entry to keep the three-week trip on time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that statement, included below, never mentioned the 80-year-old woman with a medical emergency that the cruise left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/teen-killed-catfish-murder-hire-plot-planned-worst-offender-seeking-videos-death-child-porn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TEEN KILLED IN ‘CATFISH’ MURDER-FOR-HIRE PLOT PLANNED BY ‘WORST OFFENDER’ SEEKING VIDEOS OF DEATH, CHILD PORN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital received statements early Tuesday morning, 24 hours after asking questions about both situations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;During the same sailing, on March 27, 2024, a separate and completely unrelated unfortunate event occurred regarding a guest who was evaluated by our onboard medical team and later thought it best for her to be disembarked to receive further assessment and treatment as needed from a local hospital,&quot; the cruise line said in an email. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unnamed, 80-year-old woman &quot;was medically disembarked after being evaluated by our onboard medical team, who thought it best that she receive further assessment and treatment as needed from a local hospital.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Following her disembarkation from the ship, our Care Team was immediately activated to provide support to the guest,&quot; the cruise line said in its statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We attempted to call the guest several times, and as we were unable to reach her, we worked directly with our port agent in São Tomé and Príncipe, an African island nation, to receive updates about the guest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In instances such as these, as the guest was released from the hospital and in a coherent state, our protocol is to contact the guest directly, as we would not have the authority to share any medical details with anyone else without their expressed consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The guest has since been escorted on a flight to Lisbon, Portugal, and then put in the care of airport staff to continue her journey to the United States, where she has now made a safe return.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lana thanked everyone for their caring posts about her mom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thank you all for your posts. (Regarding my previous post about my mom),&quot; Lana wrote. &quot;São Tomé is very primitive and doesn’t have hospitals that could treat her properly. She was on a group tour sponsored by the cruise line of a museum and collapsed and was unconscious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How or who was contacted to get her to the limited medical clinic we do not know. We just know that she was left by Norwegian Cruise Line without as much as calling her emergency contacts, or leaving her with her wallet, credit cards, or travel insurance papers at the clinic or maybe a note for her to read when she came to.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she finally regained consciousness, Lana said she didn&apos;t remember anything that happened but was helped by &quot;good Samaritans&quot; that they later learned were Jay and Jill Campbell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two couples have been in communication with each other over the last few days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While this is a very unfortunate situation, guests are responsible for ensuring they return to the ship at the published time, which is communicated broadly over the ship’s intercom, in the daily communication and posted just before exiting the vessel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Guests are responsible for any necessary travel costs to rejoin the ship at the next available port of call. When the guests did not return to the vessel at the all-aboard time, their passports were delivered to the local port agents to retrieve when they returned to the port.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our team has been working closely with the local authorities to understand the requirements and necessary visas needed if the guests were to rejoin the ship at the next available port of call. We are in communication with the guests and providing additional information as it becomes available.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Rare gene variant believed to play a role in understanding why people are left-hand dominant</title>
                    
                    <description>Researchers have linked a rare gene variant involved with controlling the shape of cells to the development of the brain asymmetry known for determining a dominant hand.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What do Lady Gaga, Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Paul McCartney and Justin Bieber have in common with Ronald Reagan, Jimi Hendrix, Judy Garland, Fidel Castro and David Bowie? They are all left-handed, a trait shared by roughly 10% of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why are some people left-handed while most are righties? That is an area of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/science&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;active research&lt;/a&gt;, and a new study sheds light on a genetic component of left-handedness in some people. Researchers identified rare variants of a gene involved in controlling the shape of cells and found them to be 2.7 times more common in left-handed people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/natural-science/genetics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;genetic variants&lt;/a&gt; account for only a tiny fraction - perhaps 0.1% - of left-handedness, the researchers said the study shows that this gene, called TUBB4B, may play a role in the development of the brain asymmetry that underlies the determination of a dominant hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/remains-oregon-teenager-identified-54-years-advanced-genetic-genealogy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REMAINS OF OREGON TEENAGER IDENTIFIED AFTER 54 YEARS USING ADVANCED GENETIC GENEALOGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most people, the two halves, or hemispheres, of the brain have slightly different anatomies and are dominant for different functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For example, most people have left-hemisphere dominance for language, and right-hemisphere dominance for tasks that require directing visual attention to a location in space,&quot; said neurobiologist Clyde Francks of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands, senior author of the study published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In most people, the left hemisphere also controls the dominant right hand. The relevant nerve fibers cross from left-to-right in the lower part of the brain. In left-handers, the right hemisphere is in control of the dominant hand. The question is: what causes the asymmetry of the brain to develop differently in left-handers?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TUBB4B controls a protein that gets integrated into filaments called microtubules that provide internal structure for cells. The identification of rare mutations in this gene that are more common in left-handers suggests that microtubules are involved in setting up the brain&apos;s normal asymmetries, Francks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two cerebral hemispheres start to develop differently in the human embryo, though the mechanism has remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rare genetic variants in just a handful of people can pinpoint genes that give clues to developmental mechanisms of brain asymmetry in everyone. TUBB4B could be a good example of this,&quot; Francks added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/new-breast-cancer-gene-can-predict-likelihood-disease-study-finds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;genetic data&lt;/a&gt; covering more than 350,000 middle-aged to older adults in Britain in a dataset called the UK Biobank. About 11% were left-handed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/what-determines-size-feet-heres-what-goes-what-can-change&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT DETERMINES THE SIZE OF OUR FEET? HERE&apos;S WHAT GOES INTO IT — AND WHAT CAN CHANGE IT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, the determination of which hand is dominant may come down to chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We think that most instances of left-handedness occur simply due to random variation during development of the embryonic brain, without specific genetic or environmental influences. For example, random fluctuations in the concentrations of certain molecules during key stages of brain formation,&quot; Francks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the centuries, many cultures disparaged left-handedness and tried to force lefties to become right-handed. In English, the word &quot;right&quot; also means &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;proper.&quot; The word &quot;sinister&quot; derives from a Latin word meaning &quot;on the left side.&quot; And a &quot;left-handed compliment&quot; means an insult masquerading as praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of left-handedness varies in different parts of the world, with lower rates in Africa, Asia and the Middle East compared to Europe and North America, Francks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This likely reflects suppression of left-handedness in some cultures - making &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/international-left-handers-day-smarter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;left-handed kids&lt;/a&gt; switch to right-handedness, which also used to happen in Europe and North America,&quot; Francks added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings might have relevance in the field of psychiatry. While the overwhelming majority of left-handed people have neither of these conditions, people with schizophrenia are around twice as likely to be left-handed or ambidextrous and people with autism are around three times as likely, Francks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some of the genes that function in the developing brain during early life might be involved in both brain asymmetry and psychiatric traits. Our study found suggestive evidence of this, and we have also seen it in previous studies where we looked at more common genetic variants in the population,&quot; Francks added.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hospitals must obtain written informed consent from patients before subjecting them to pelvic exams and exams of other sensitive areas — especially if an exam will be done while the patient is unconscious, the federal government said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New guidance from the U.S. Department of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; now requires consent for breast, pelvic, prostate and rectal exams for &quot;educational and training purposes&quot; performed by medical students, nurse practitioners or physician assistants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department&apos;s release said the guidance was issued to &quot;reiterate and provide clarity&quot; regarding hospital consent requirements. Federal regulations previously mentioned obtaining consent for &quot;important tasks&quot; related to surgeries, and did not provide the level of detail about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;medical students.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If hospitals don’t obtain explicit consent, they may be ineligible for participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs, and also may be subject to fines and investigations if they violate patient privacy laws, Office of Civil Rights director Melanie Fontes Rainer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/virginia-declares-statewide-outbreak-meningococcal-disease-rare-but-serious&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;VIRGINIA DECLARES STATEWIDE OUTBREAK OF MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE: &apos;RARE BUT SERIOUS&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors and medical students sometimes perform exams of sensitive areas for training purposes when a patient is under anesthesia. At least 20 states have passed laws requiring a patient&apos;s consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and other top health officials criticized these exams happening without explicit consent in a letter sent to teaching hospitals and medical schools Monday. The letter said hospitals need to set &quot;clear guidelines to ensure providers and trainees performing these examinations first obtain and document informed consent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s difficult to say how often these exams take place, experts said, or how often patients understand what they&apos;re consenting to when they sign forms before surgery giving broad consent for a range of procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter is a &quot;critical leap forward in protecting patients and medical residents,&quot; Scott Berkowitz, founder and president of the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s a shocking problem with a very simple solution — hospitals need to ask for consent clearly and explicitly,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexandra Fountaine, a medical student at Ohio University who testified in front of a state House committee against the practice, was skeptical that the letter would result in &quot;actual policy or real change.&quot; But, she added, it made her feel more protected and respected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Something like that happening is my biggest fear,&quot; she said. &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/womens-health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;As women&lt;/a&gt; we’re all afraid of being violated on a daily basis … but when we’re put in very vulnerable positions, like being anesthetized, I think that’s especially terrifying.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Officials from dozens of countries met on Tuesday in the Netherlands, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged delegates to &amp;apos;tackle impunity for war crimes.&amp;apos;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/zelenskyy-trump-doesnt-know-putin-russian-dictator-never-stop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday urged delegates at a conference on justice and compensation in Ukraine to continue efforts to tackle impunity for war crimes in order to &quot;provide real strength to our common security — security from aggressions and terror.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers and officials from dozens of countries met in the Netherlands to discuss how to bring justice to victims of Russia&apos;s invasion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/situation-in-ukraine-is-dire-as-ammunition-supplies-drop-on-us-europe-starvation-diet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, as the war sparked by Russia&apos;s invasion drags on in its third devastating year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/zelenskyy-responds-moscow-concert-hall-shooting-rips-putin-suggesting-ukraine-behind-terror-attack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZELENSKYY RESPONDS TO MOSCOW CONCERT HALL SHOOTING, RIPS PUTIN FOR SUGGESTING UKRAINE BEHIND TERROR ATTACK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/international-criminal-court-issues-putin-arrest-warrant-child-deportations-ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;International Criminal Court&lt;/a&gt; has issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and the country&apos;s commissioner for children’s rights charging them with personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court also has issued warrants for two senior Russian military officers for alleged responsibility for attacks on critical infrastructure in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Let the real peace be restored faster. And let everyone who destroys peace be truly afraid of facing trial in The Hague,&quot; Zelenskyy said in a video message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine&apos;s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, told the meeting that his country has identified 551 war crimes suspects, indicted 374 and has already prosecuted 104 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the conference, a register of damage caused by Russia’s invasion was formally opened, allowing people to submit claims for compensation for damages, loss or injury suffered as a result of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hague-based Register of Damage Caused by the Aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, or RD4U, was established by the Council of Europe last year. It will not pay out any claims, but is a stepping stone toward an international compensation mechanism that has not yet been established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch focused on claims for damage or destruction of residential property. It said that between 300,000 and 600,000 claims are expected. RD4U aims to allow further claims soon, including those related to damage or destruction of Ukrainian critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening the conference, Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot said the devastating toll of Russian attacks underscored the need to support Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Because if we don’t, the country’s justice system will eventually collapse under the weight of these atrocities,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hague, known as the international city of peace and justice, is central to efforts to bring accountability and end impunity for crimes in Ukraine. It is home to the International Criminal Court and the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine, and the Dutch government has offered to host a special tribunal on the crime of aggression. While the ICC is investigating crimes in Ukraine, it does not have jurisdiction to prosecute the crime of aggression in the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>3 defendants plead guilty in Minnesota murder case of a young mother</title>
                    
                    <description>Three people have pleaded guilty to the 2022 murder of Zaria McKeever in Minnesota after the attorney general took over amid public criticism that the original plea deal was too lenient.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The final three people accused in the killing of a young mother have pleaded guilty in a rare situation where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/minnesota&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz&lt;/a&gt; took the case away from Hennepin County prosecutors and handed it to Attorney General Keith Ellison amid public criticism that the original plea deal was too lenient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a plea agreement, Erick Haynes pleaded guilty Monday to one count of first-degree murder in the 2022 death of Zaria McKeever. Eriana Haynes and Tavion James pleaded guilty to one count each of aiding an offender after the fact for helping to cover up the shooting, Ellison&apos;s office said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erick Haynes will be sentenced April 12. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;First-degree murder&lt;/a&gt; in Minnesota carries a mandatory life sentence with the possibility of parole after 30 years. The state will recommend a four-year sentence for Eriana Haynes and a sentence of three years and six months for James, Ellison&apos;s office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/minnesota-ag-says-auto-manufacturers-need-make-sure-cars-not-tempting-young-people-steal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MINNESOTA AG SAYS AUTO MANUFACTURERS NEED TO MAKE SURE THEIR CARS ARE NOT &apos;TEMPTING&apos; YOUNG PEOPLE TO STEAL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment of Erick Haynes said he sent two juveniles into an apartment with guns to kill McKeever&apos;s new boyfriend on Nov. 8, 2022. Instead, the juveniles shot McKeever, 23, five times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 22, 17-year-old Foday Kevin Kamara pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree intentional murder for his role in the killing. Kamara had agreed to be certified as an adult. The state agreed to recommend that Kamara get 10 years and 10 months at his sentencing May 8. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/minneapolis-man-cleared-triple-homicide-gets-26-years-kidnapping&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Minnesota inmates&lt;/a&gt; typically serve two-thirds of their sentences in prison and the rest on supervised release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;With all defendants in this case having now pleaded guilty for their roles in this heinous crime, today is another important step toward justice for Zaria and her family,&quot; Ellison said in the news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKeever, of Brooklyn Park, was the mother of a 1-year-old child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty had offered Kamara and another defendant juvenile plea deals that would have spared them lengthy adult sentences in exchange for their testimony. Moriarty said at the time that prosecuting them as juveniles offered the best chance for rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison and Walz intervened over Moriarty’s objections after the other juvenile’s plea deal had already been accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attorney general typically takes over criminal cases only at the request of local prosecutors. At the request of Moriarty’s predecessor, Ellison prosecuted former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the killing of George Floyd.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Sean &amp;quot;Diddy&amp;quot; Combs formed close relationships with the rich and powerful, just like disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein, &amp;quot;Takedown&amp;quot; host Chris Hansen said.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/chris-hansen-sounds-alarm-sting-nets-migrants-pimping-others-indebted-cartels&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Takedown&quot; host Chris Hansen&lt;/a&gt; argued Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs&apos; connections to the rich and powerful were unlikely to protect him from federal charges as allegations against the hip hop mogul continue to pile up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combs&apos; mansions were raided last week after a series of damning civil lawsuits accused him of trafficking sex, guns and drugs and other bad behavior. He settled the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-settles-lawsuit-one-day-after-ex-girlfriend-cassies-allegations-years-rape&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;first lawsuit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from R&amp;amp;B singer Cassie, his ex-girlfriend whose real name is Casandra Ventura, a day after she filed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hansen argued that Combs, whose net worth is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-1-billion-fortune-risk-after-bombshell-allegations-how-music-mogul-created-empire&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;estimated $1 billion&lt;/a&gt;, aligned himself with the rich and powerful to give him &quot;credibility,&quot; much like late sex-trafficking financier Jeffrey Epstein did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was very successful in doing that and that made him a lot of money and gave him credibility outside the hip hop, rap world. And that&apos;s what he was trying to do here. A lot like [Jeffrey] Epstein did with very powerful political and business figures,&quot; he told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News host&lt;/a&gt; Jesse Watters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/sean-diddy-combs-cant-settle-feds-sex-trafficking-probe-former-fbi-agent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEAN ‘DIDDY’ COMBS CAN&apos;T ‘SETTLE’ WITH FEDS AMID SEX TRAFFICKING PROBE: FORMER FBI AGENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former show host of &quot;To Catch a Predator&quot; said both Diddy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/sean-diddy-combs-luxury-yacht-draws-comparisons-epstein-island-amid-sex-trafficking-probe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;and Epstein&lt;/a&gt; appeared to let fame and prestige cloud their judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These guys get drunk with power, allegedly — Diddy has said that these allegations are false — but they get drunk with power and all of a sudden they lose their balance and what&apos;s right and what&apos;s wrong, and they&apos;re insulated, and they get everybody telling them they&apos;re great,&quot; he argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his connections, the mogul was unlikely to escape charges due to the closely held federal investigation, Hansen argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/r-kelly-sentenced-20-years-prison-child-sex-crimes-avoids-effective-life-sentence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Disgraced singer and producer R. Kelly&lt;/a&gt; also faced civil lawsuits before accusations of trafficking, he noted. R. Kelly is currently serving a 31-year prison sentence based on child pornography charges, racketeering and sex trafficking convictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-accused-male-music-producer-sexual-assault&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEAN ‘DIDDY’ COMBS ACCUSED BY MALE MUSIC PRODUCER OF SEXUAL ASSAULT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It started with civil suits, then HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] got involved,&quot; Hansen remarked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These civil suits are just like a silver platter for the feds to take these guys down,&quot; Watters added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the federal investigation, Combs has not been charged with a crime and denied all accusations of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Michael Ruiz contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Worshipped Joe growing up. Always had me and my brother laughing. Count Floyd, Guy Caballero. Any move he made,&quot; Sandler shared on X, formerly known as Twitter. &quot;He crushed as border guard in Stripes. Couldn’t be more fun to have him heckle me on the golf course. The nicest guy you could know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Genius of a comedian. And a true sweetheart. Perfect combo. Much love to his kids and thanks to Joe for all the greatness he gave us all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Tilly remembered Flaherty for playing her father in &quot;The Wrong Guy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was so thrilled to be able to work with him,&quot; she wrote. &quot;His performance was pitch perfect. A great comedian.
