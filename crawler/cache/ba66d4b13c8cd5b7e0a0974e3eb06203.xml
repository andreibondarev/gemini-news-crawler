    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[Los Angeles, CA - July 13: Portrait of Sandra Munoz, a celebrated civil rights attorney in Los Angeles. She is holding a photo of her husband Luis on January 3, 2024, in Los Angeles, CA. They have been separated since 2015. Luis, who was undocumented, applied for a waiver of his illegal entry to seek citizenship after they got married. The final step was considered a formality -- he would go back to El Salvador for an interview at the U.S. consulate there and fly back to the U.S. once it was approved. Instead, it was denied. When their lawyers pressed the government for why, the State Department admitted that his tattoos -- of La Virgen de Guadalupe, a tribal design and theatrical masks -- were among the reasons they had found him to be an MS-13 gang member, an assertion he vehemently denies. Last year, the 9th Circuit sided with the couple, but the Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court. The high court is expected to decide next month whether to take up the case, which would have ripple effects for any immigrant seeking to challenge the government's views of their character.

Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October, olive farmers throughout the region worry that their way of life may be on the verge of extinction N with settlers using the war as a pretext for a land grab. Abu Awad and his family have been beaten up and repeatedly threatened with expulsion from their land. Their house was vandalized, and some of their farm equipment was confiscated or destroyed. But even before the war, the annual job had become increasingly difficult over the years for the more than 100,000 Palestinian families in the West Bank that rely on it for their livelihood.

Hope had been living homeless in an encampment near the 710 and 105 freeways for the past two years. Outreach workers with the Los Angeles Housing convinced Hope to move into the hotel. Project Roomkey is a coordinated effort to secure hotel and motel rooms in L.A. County as temporary shelters for people experiencing homelessness who are at high-risk for hospitalization if they contract Coronavirus (COVID-19). The city and county of Los Angeles plan to move people from the freeways. U.S. District Judge David O. Carter passed a landmark court order banning homeless encampments from under and along Los Angeles freeways. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>
