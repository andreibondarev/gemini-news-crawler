					<description><![CDATA[“The tragic attack on volunteers and your reaction arouse understandable anger,” Polish PM warned Israeli leader. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk&nbsp;on Wednesday hit out at his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu, following a deadly Israeli bombing on seven aid workers in Gaza earlier this week. </p>



<p>The killing of the seven workers from World Central Kitchen has sparked a huge backlash from world leaders and inflamed concerns over the Israel Defense Forces&#8217; war tactics.</p>



<p>“Prime Minister Netanyahu, Mr. Ambassador [Yacov]&nbsp;Livne, the vast majority of Poles showed full solidarity with Israel after the Hamas attack. Today you are putting this solidarity to a really hard test,&#8221; Tusk <a href="https://twitter.com/donaldtusk/status/1775417561674322317?s=20" target="_blank">wrote</a> on social media. </p>



<p>“The tragic attack on volunteers and your reaction arouse understandable anger,” Tusk added. </p>



<p>Poland and Israel have been trying in recent years to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-poland-presidents-agree-restore-relations-proper-course-2022-07-04/" target="_blank">restore</a> frayed diplomatic relations, which had deteriorated after the previous, nationalist government in Warsaw brought in a law limiting Jews&#8217; ability to recover World War II properties. </p>



<p>World Central Kitchen, a U.S.-based organization that said it had supplied 42 million meals over 175 days in Gaza, suspended its operations in the region following the Israeli strike. The dead aid workers included Australian, Polish and British citizens, according to the nonprofit organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Tuesday, Netanyahu <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/seven-aid-workers-uk-poland-killed-gaza-strike-idf-israel-world-central-kitchen/">admitted</a> that an “unintentional” Israeli airstrike killed “innocent people” in Gaza. </p>



<p>Israeli forces have been bombarding Hamas in Gaza for months, after Palestinian militants killed 1,200 people and took hundreds of others hostage in a deadly attack on Oct. 7 last year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Efforts to tighten restrictions on civil society and campaigners led to widespread protests last year. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Georgia&#8217;s government is reviving a controversial bid to brand charities, pressure groups and opposition media outlets as agents of foreign influence.</p>



<p>The move comes just over a year after the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/georgia-tbilisi-government-abandons-russia-putin-style-foreign-agent-bill/">proposals were dropped</a> in the face of massive public outcry and huge street protests in Tbilisi.</p>



<p>The ruling Georgian Dream party on Wednesday <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GeorgianDreamOfficial/videos/392483536883956/" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that the so-called foreign agent law would be reintroduced. According to its parliamentary leader, Mamuka Mdinaradze, the proposals will be virtually unchanged, and organizations receiving funding from overseas would be obliged to declare they are &#8220;carrying out the interests of a foreign power.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to analysis by <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/03/07/georgia-foreign-agents-bill-tramples-rights" target="_blank">Human Rights Watch</a> when the law was first proposed, the bill would &#8220;impose additional onerous reporting requirements, inspections, and administrative and criminal liability, including up to five years in prison for violations.&#8221; </p>



<p>Russia has used similar measures to squeeze out civil society groups critical of the government. The EU&#8217;s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, previously <a href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/georgia-statement-high-representative-adoption-%E2%80%9Cforeign-influence%E2%80%9D-law_en" target="_blank">said</a> Georgia&#8217;s version of the law would be &#8220;incompatible with EU values and standards&#8221; and &#8220;goes against Georgia’s stated objective of joining the EU.&#8221; </p>



<p>Thousands took to the streets of Georgia over two days in March 2023 as part of protests against the legislation that saw police using tear gas and riot gear against demonstrators. The government was forced to drop the bill &#8220;unconditionally,&#8221; although hinted it could bring it back at a later date.</p>



<p>Eka Gigauri, executive director of anti-corruption NGO Transparency International Georgia, which itself would be likely to be branded a foreign agent, accused Georgian Dream of following &#8220;the Russian playbook.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We are not going to stigmatize ourselves and put this sign up saying &#8216;we are spies&#8217; because we consider ourselves patriots doing whatever we can to make this country better,&#8221; she told POLITICO.</p>



<p>Just last week, the Georgian government <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/georgia-ban-change-gender-new-anti-lgbtq-law-tbilisi/">announced</a> it would introduce a bill to criminalize  the promotion of same-sex relationships, similar to Russia&#8217;s tough &#8220;LGBTQ+ propaganda&#8221; rules. That bill was put forward despite Brussels <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/the-eus-report-card-on-potential-new-members-of-the-bloc/">warning</a> the prospective EU member country, which was granted <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/enlargement/georgia/" target="_blank">candidate status</a> in December 2023, to strengthen human rights protections. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Israeli faces growing condemnation for high death toll of humanitarian workers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The deadly Israeli airstrike that killed seven food aid workers in Gaza was “appalling,” two senior EU officials said Wednesday.</p>



<p>Israel&#8217;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted Tuesday that the Israel Defense Forces killed the World Central Kitchen workers, but described the strike as unintentional. The <a href="https://wck.org/news/gaza-team-update" target="_blank">charity stressed in a statement</a> that its convoy was hit “despite coordinating movements with the IDF.”</p>



<p>Amid an <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-david-cameron-slam-completely-unacceptable-killing-aid-worker-gaza/">outpouring of international condemnation</a> for Israel, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and EU Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič issued a <a href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/gazaisrael-joint-statement-high-representative-and-commissioner-crisis-management-killing_en" target="_blank">joint statement</a> urging “a swift implementation of the announced commitment by the Israeli authorities to conduct a thorough investigation and ensure accountability for those who are responsible.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We recall the Israeli obligation under International Humanitarian Law to protect humanitarian workers at all times,&#8221; they added.&#8221; A high number of humanitarian workers have lost their lives since the beginning of the war in Gaza.&#8221;</p>



<p>More than 200 humanitarian workers have been killed since the start of the war, according to Spanish newspaper <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://elpais.com/internacional/2024-04-03/200-trabajadores-humanitarios-muertos-otro-triste-record-de-la-guerra-de-gaza.html?ssm=TW_CC" target="_blank">El País</a>.</p>



<p>World Central Kitchen, a U.S.-based organization that said it had supplied 42 million meals over 175 days in Gaza, suspended its operations in the region following the strike.</p>



<p>Israel is under growing international pressure over its conduct in Gaza, where more than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed in ongoing bombardments, according to local authorities. Israel&#8217;s military operations began in retaliation for a deadly attack by Hamas militants on its soil on Oct. 7 last year. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Trump said he’ll make more comments on abortion “next week.”]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>GRAND RAPIDS, Michigan — Donald Trump found refuge from the abortion wars in an old standby on Tuesday, railing against “Biden’s border bloodbath” in a swing county some 1,283 miles from the southern border.</p>



<p>In his first pair of visits to battleground states in 24 days, Trump declared “every state a border state and every town a border town” at an event in Michigan, before jetting to Wisconsin for a rally in Green Bay.</p>



<p>Before splayed photographs of what he said were victims of “migrant crime” at a roundtable with local and state law enforcement in Grand Rapids, Trump got the kind of campaign-ready visuals he wanted when he celebrated tanking a bipartisan border deal earlier this year.</p>



<p>Attendees in a convention center ballroom booed and drowned out a reporter who asked about abortion following Trump’s remarks. The presumptive GOP nominee dodged questions about whether he supported Florida’s six-week abortion ban, telling reporters he’d make additional comments on abortion “next week.”</p>



<p>His visit coincided with a barrage of criticism from Democrats over a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/01/florida-supreme-court-abortion-ruling-00150006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Florida state Supreme Court ruling</a>&nbsp;that will allow the six-week ban to come into effect in the state. The dueling broadsides on abortion and immigration offered the most vivid glimpse yet of two major policy fronts opening in the early stages of the general election campaign.</p>



<p>“In many ways, today is the kickoff of the general election,” said John Yob, a Republican strategist in Michigan. “And Grand Rapids, Michigan, is ground zero in the national election, because if President Trump can over-perform relative to his 2016 and 2020 numbers in West Michigan, then that puts Michigan out of reach for President Biden, which means the country is out of reach for President Biden.”</p>



<p>It was no coincidence that Trump chose Grand Rapids as his setting for remarks on illegal immigration. His appearance came on the heels of the killing of 25-year-old Ruby Garcia, allegedly at the hands of a man who had entered the country illegally after being deported to Mexico in 2020. But the city is also the seat of swingy Kent County, which Trump won in 2016 and Biden won back in 2020.</p>



<p>“You win Michigan,” Trump said, “you win the election.”</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://s20710.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Electoral-Impact-of-Illegal-Immigrant-Murder.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memo last week</a>&nbsp;about the Garcia killing’s effect on the general election, Yob wrote that “the immigration crisis is likely to move historically centrist Republicans in West Michigan who were torn in recent Presidential elections firmly into President Trump’s corner.”</p>



<p>“People are pretty much picking their issue base,” said Stu Sandler, a Michigan Republican strategist and former National Republican Senatorial Committee political director. “The challenge for Democrats is immigration is more impacting independent voters through the economic and crime aspects than abortion does in everyday life.”</p>



<p>Before Trump spoke, a short video featuring grisly clips of news reports documenting crimes allegedly committed by immigrants played over dramatic music. Trump referred to immigrants who entered the country illegally as “animals” nearly half a dozen times. “Democrats say, ‘Please don’t call them animals, they’re humans,’ Trump said. “I said, ‘No, they’re not humans, they’re animals.’”</p>



<p>For Trump, the emphasis on immigration represented an attempt to pivot away from the state Supreme Court ruling in Florida on Monday on abortion, a far more toxic issue for him — and one on which he has yet to articulate a clear position.</p>



<p>Pressed on the ruling in Florida, his campaign said in a statement that Trump “supports preserving life but has also made clear that he supports states’ rights because he supports the voters’ right to make decisions for themselves.”</p>



<p>The statement did nothing to deflect an onslaught from Democrats, who spent the day pounding him on abortion.</p>



<p>In a press call, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Rep.&nbsp;Nikema Williams&nbsp;(D-Ga.) and Fentrice Driskell, the Florida state House Democratic leader, all linked Trump to what Williams described as having “effectively ushered in a de facto abortion ban across the entire southeast of the United States.”</p>



<p>Driskell cited Democratic victories in state House races over the last two years, including in Alabama last week, as evidence that “when faced with the choice of supporting a candidate who would restrict women’s health care freedom versus one who would protect it, voters overwhelmingly supported the candidates who promised to resist government overreach into personal health decisions.”<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/02/trump-attacks-judges-families-gag-order-00150080" target="_blank"></a></p>



<p>In Michigan, Trump mapped out what he said could bolster his standing with the kind of suburban voters who populate Kent County.</p>



<p>“The suburban housewives actually like Donald Trump. You know why? Because I am the one that’s going to keep them safe,” Trump said.</p>



<p>He also said that he had spoken with Garcia’s family, but a representative for the family told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fox17online.com/news/local-news/he-did-not-ruby-garcias-family-says-trump-did-not-speak-with-them-about-young-womans-death" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a local Fox affiliate</a>&nbsp;Tuesday that was untrue. A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to a POLITICO request for comment.</p>



<p>Michigan Republicans said the focus on abortion was meant to distract from Trump’s strengths.</p>



<p>“You can tell they don’t want to talk about the economy, they don’t want to talk about the border here and it’s interesting they bring abortion up in Michigan,” Michigan GOP Chair Pete Hoekstra told POLITICO in an interview after Trump’s remarks. “Not that I liked the policy, but Michigan voters two years ago enshrined some of the most liberal abortion policies in the country.”</p>



<p>He added, “we have the greatest assets you can have: the issues.”</p>



<p>The Democratic National Committee bracketed Trump’s visit to Grand Rapids with four billboards in the area that attacked him for leading the charge to defeat a bipartisan border security deal in Congress: “Donald Trump broke the border,” the billboards read. “Donald Trump just wants chaos, not solutions.”</p>



<p>“The top cultural issues in the 2024 campaign will center on immigration and abortion,” said Doug Herman, a Democratic strategist. “In a typical year, these two issues would probably cancel each other out with neither side having an advantage in the end.”</p>



<p>However, he said, “This year is different. Republicans are stopping immigration and border reform, while abortion rights are at greater risk than ever before. Swing voters are looking for action on these issues, and Democrats are going to have the upper hand when they make that decision.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Officials are expected to discuss gradually moving the organization — called the Ukraine Defense Contact Group — into the alliance’s control.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. and other Western countries are considering transferring to NATO a U.S.-led multinational group that coordinates the shipment of weapons to Ukraine, one of several new proposals that could help maintain the flow of arms to Kyiv under a second Donald Trump presidency.</p>



<p>During the NATO foreign ministerial meeting in Brussels Wednesday and Thursday, officials are expected to discuss a range of options, including gradually moving the organization — called the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/01/austin-defense-meetings-weapons-ukraine-00089946" target="_blank"><u>Ukraine Defense Contact Group</u></a>&nbsp;— into the alliance’s control, according to three European officials and a U.S. official with knowledge of the internal deliberations. The goal would be to finalize the move at the NATO leaders’ summit in Washington in July, one of the officials said.</p>



<p>A second U.S. official said that another proposal would give NATO a more formalized seat at the table within the Ukraine group, as opposed to moving it under NATO control. The idea, from the U.S. side, would be to strengthen the ties between NATO and Ukraine for long-term support, the official said.</p>



<p>The Ukraine group was launched in the early weeks of the war by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and then-Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Mark Milley to coordinate Western support for Kyiv’s defenses. It’s credited with speeding tens of billions of dollars in equipment, weapons and other aid to Ukraine that have been critical in staving off Russian forces.</p>



<p>The discussions about NATO’s involvement with the group are happening “at very senior levels,” with the goal of formalizing European and alliance support for Kyiv, said the U.S. official, adding that one consideration heading into U.S. and European elections is to make the group “more enduring.”</p>



<p>Defense Department spokesperson Maj. Charlie Dietz declined to confirm the discussions, saying DOD had “no new announcements to make regarding the format or structure” of the group.</p>



<p>“We are constantly discussing how we can ensure that our support for Ukraine is sustained and how we can organize the support in the best possible way,” Dietz said.</p>



<p>Transferring the group to NATO would be a significant move toward cementing Western support for Ukraine’s war for the foreseeable future, amid Europe’s fear of the return of Trump to the White House. In the near term, domestic politics in the U.S. and other countries is already threatening to cut off funding to send Kyiv additional weapons.</p>



<p>Formalizing the group within NATO would go a long way toward protecting support for Ukraine from changes in U.S. and Western governments, experts said — and particularly from Trump.</p>



<p>“There’s a feeling among, not the whole group but a part of the NATO group, that thinks it is better to institutionalize the process just in case of a Trump re-election,” said Jim Townsend, a former Pentagon and NATO official. “And that’s something that the U.S. is going to have to get used to hearing, because that is a fear, and a legitimate one.</p>



<p>“Pulling this under NATO kind of isolates it from a Trump presidency, or even from a U.S. that might get distracted by China and can’t keep it going or can’t get his own funding act together,” he added.</p>



<p>If successful, the move would be the latest among a series of actions taken to shore up institutions in anticipation of another Trump presidency. Late last year, lawmakers approved a law to require congressional approval if a future president tried to pull out of NATO,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/12/democrats-guardrails-nato-trump-00141041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and are considering further protection measures</a>.</p>



<p>Austin and Milley established the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in the spring of 2022, weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine. The idea was to bring together defense chiefs from various Western countries to discuss what weapons and other military aid to send to Kyiv.</p>



<p>However, the group has run into obstacles in recent months as U.S. funding for Ukraine dried up. The Pentagon said in December it would not be able to send any additional weapons from its stockpiles until Congress appropriated additional funds for the war effort. The Senate passed a $95 billion supplemental package including additional aid for Ukraine, but the legislation has been stalled in the House for months.</p>



<p>The Pentagon cobbled together&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/12/white-house-aid-package-ukraine-00146487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new $300 million package&nbsp;</a>of aid last month, including much-needed artillery and air defenses, by using cost savings from previous contracts. This allowed DOD to send additional weapons without harming U.S. military readiness.</p>



<p>The package will include a number of Army Tactical Missile Systems that can travel 100 miles and carry warheads containing cluster bomblets,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/12/white-house-aid-package-ukraine-00146487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">POLITICO first reported</a>. Ukraine has been asking for more of the missiles for months in order to attack targets deep inside Russian front lines.</p>



<p>But DOD officials now say they cannot send additional aid until Congress passes the supplemental.</p>



<p>“As you’ve seen us continue to urge, the most important thing that we want to see Congress pass is the supplemental,” Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said on Monday. “Hopefully, when the House is back in session next week, they will bring it to the floor, and then we can continue getting out those [packages] regularly.”</p>



<p>Julianne Smith, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said the focus is on getting Ukraine additional ammunition and air defenses.</p>



<p>“So that tends to be the focus of our discussions, both in the US-led UDCG and among allies here in NATO headquarters, the way in which that we can ensure that the Ukrainians continue to have the upper hand and see success on the battlefield is to keep that assistance flowing,” Smith said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[“They have some answering to do,” a DOD official said.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Israel’s strike against aid workers trying to get food to residents in Gaza reverberated across Washington on Tuesday, particularly resonating because of the American death and the connections the group’s founder — José Andrés — has to the capital.</p>



<p>Administration officials lashed out at new levels, and Israel was left struggling for damage control.</p>



<p>Seven people died in Monday’s strike against a convoy from World Central Kitchen, an aid organization that provides meals to civilians suffering from hunger due to conflicts and is led by Andrés, who is also a well known Spanish-American chef with several restaurants in Washington. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/seven-aid-workers-uk-poland-killed-gaza-strike-idf-israel-world-central-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>said the strike was</u></a>&nbsp;“unintentional” and killed “innocent people.”</p>



<p>An administration official, who has worked with Andrés on international food and health security initiatives, called the strike “devastating” and said it compounds the human suffering that Andrés and his team were trying to relieve.</p>



<p>The strike also “underscores Israeli carelessness toward Gaza civilians and international humanitarians alike,” said the official, who like others in this article was granted anonymity to speak candidly about their thoughts on Israel’s recent actions.</p>



<p>It was “definitely a mistake and they have some answering to do,” a Defense Department official said. “Something went wrong.”</p>



<p>A dual American-Canadian citizen was killed in the strike, which appears to be the first instance of an American killed by an Israeli strike during the conflict in Gaza. The State Department didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>



<p>During a meeting with Israeli officials on Tuesday, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant confirmed his country will investigate the strike and outlined other steps the government is taking to address concerns about aid distribution in Gaza.</p>



<p>The White House was “outraged” to learn of the strike, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday. Still, Kirby said Washington would continue to support Israel’s defense of itself, even while “there are issues of deconfliction that clearly need to be fleshed out and improved.”</p>



<p>He said that there’s “no evidence” yet that Israel deliberately killed aid workers, cautioning reporters to wait for the results of Israel’s investigation into the matter.</p>



<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/blinken-calls-swift-impartial-investigation-killing-aid-workers-gaza/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>told reporters Tuesday</u></a>&nbsp;that Washington has already brought the matter up directly with the Israeli government and stressed “the imperative to do more to protect innocent civilian lives.”</p>



<p>But other officials who talked to POLITICO said they’re frustrated with how Israel has conducted investigations in the past and are doubtful there will be accountability.</p>



<p>The official who worked with Andrés cited the death of Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, who Israel&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/05/israeli-army-says-soldier-likely-killed-al-jazeera-reporter-00054798" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>found was likely killed</u></a>&nbsp;by an Israeli soldier while reporting in the occupied West Bank in 2022. But no one was punished for her death, and the U.S.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/04/gunfire-that-killed-palestinian-american-journalist-likely-came-from-israeli-military-positions-u-s-says-00043906" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>wouldn’t conclusively place blame</u></a>&nbsp;on Israel.</p>



<p>Israel will “do and say whatever is necessary to maintain the status quo and I have little hope their investigation will be transparent or honest,” the official said.</p>



<p>A third U.S. official noted that the strike on aid workers seemed intentional, since it included three bombs: “Three hits on three cars in a row is not an accident. We aren’t stupid,” the official said.</p>



<p>The workers were traveling in clearly marked cars on a route&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/katie_polglase/status/1775182310163230923?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>designated as safe</u></a>&nbsp;for aid trucks when they were attacked.</p>



<p>Some Democrats on Capitol Hill have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/02/lawmakers-denounce-world-central-kitchen-strike-00150175" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>seized on the strike</u></a>&nbsp;to further their criticism of how the Israeli government is handling the war and continue calls for conditions on Washington’s support for its Middle Eastern ally — especially if American lives are at risk. The White House has so far opposed such conditions, however.</p>



<p>The fact that the workers came from Andrés’ charity also carries particular weight in Washington, where the chef holds a number of restaurants frequented by foreign policymakers, including Zaytinya, Jaleo and Minibar, said Dave Harden, a former humanitarian assistance coordinator at the U.S. Agency for International Development.<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/02/trump-attacks-judges-families-gag-order-00150080" target="_blank"></a></p>



<p>“José Andrés is also a local DC institution and hero,” Harden&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Dave_Harden/status/1775141803475308979?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>wrote in a thread</u></a>&nbsp;on X, formerly Twitter. “This tragedy in Gaza could very well have an outsized impact on the policy environment, including amplifying calls for a cease-fire.”</p>



<p>Andrés himself&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/02/biden-spoke-with-jose-andres-00150177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>spoke with President Joe Biden</u></a>&nbsp;on Tuesday, and also&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/chefjoseandres/status/1774947232539644286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>urged Israel</u></a>&nbsp;to stop what he called “indiscriminate killing.” World Central Kitchen CEO Erin Gore&nbsp;<a href="https://wck.org/news/gaza-team-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>piled on in a statement</u></a>, calling the strike an attack on all humanitarian organizations helping to alleviate the consequences of war.</p>



<p>“This is unforgivable,” she added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[According to high-ranking Ukrainian officers, the military picture is grim and Russian generals could find success wherever they decide to focus their upcoming offensive.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Jamie Dettmer is opinion editor at POLITICO Europe.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>KYIV — Wayward entrepreneur <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1774143429720596865" target="_blank">Elon Musk’s latest pronouncements regarding the war in Ukraine</a> set teeth on edge, as he warned that even though Moscow has “no chance” of conquering all of Ukraine, “the longer the war goes on, the more territory Russia will gain until they hit the Dnipro, which is tough to overcome.”</p>



<p>“However, if the war lasts long enough, Odesa will fall too,” he cautioned.</p>



<p>With a history of urging Ukraine to agree to territorial concessions — and his opposition to the $60 billion U.S. military aid package snarled on Capitol Hill amid partisan wrangling — Musk isn’t Ukraine’s favorite commentator, to say the least. And his remarks received predictable pushback.</p>



<p>But the billionaire entrepreneur’s forecast isn’t actually all that different from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/03/29/ignatius-zelensky-interview-ukraine-aid-russia/" target="_blank">dire warnings Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made</a> in the last few days. According to Zelenskyy, unless the stalled multibillion-dollar package is approved soon, his forces will have to “go back, retreat, step by step, in small steps.” He also warned that some major cities could be at risk of falling.</p>



<p>Obviously, Zelenskyy’s warnings are part of a broad diplomatic effort to free up the military aid his forces so desperately need and have been short of for months — <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/give-us-the-damn-patriots-ukraine-needs-air-defenses-now-minister-says/">everything from 155-millimeter artillery shells to Patriot air-defense systems and drones</a>. But the sad truth is that even if the package is approved by the U.S. Congress, a massive resupply may not be enough to prevent a major battlefield upset.</p>



<p>And such a setback, especially in the middle of election campaigns in America and Europe, could very well revive Western pressure for negotiations that would obviously favor Russia, leaving the Kremlin free to revive the conflict at a future time of its choosing.</p>



<p>Essentially, everything now depends on where Russia will decide to target its strength in an offensive that’s expected to launch this summer. In a pre-offensive pummeling — stretching from Kharkiv and Sumy in the north to Odesa in the south — Russia’s missile and drone strikes have widely surged in recent weeks, targeting infrastructure and making it hard to guess where it will mount its major push.</p>



<p>And according to high-ranking Ukrainian military officers who served under General Valery Zaluzhny — <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/zelenskyy-fires-ukraines-top-general-zaluzhny/">the commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces until he was replaced in February</a> — the military picture is grim.</p>



<p>The officers said there’s a great risk of the front lines collapsing wherever Russian generals decide to focus their offensive. Moreover, thanks to a much greater weight in numbers and the guided aerial bombs that have been smashing Ukrainian positions for weeks now, Russia will likely be able to “penetrate the front line and to crash it in some parts,” they said. </p>



<p>They spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely.</p>



<p>“There’s nothing that can help Ukraine now because there are no serious technologies able to compensate Ukraine for the large mass of troops Russia is likely to hurl at us. We don&#8217;t have those technologies, and the West doesn&#8217;t have them as well in sufficient numbers,” one of the top-ranking military sources told POLITICO.</p>



<p>According to him, it is only Ukrainian grit and resilience as well as errors by Russian commanders that may now alter the grim dynamics. Mistakes like the one made on Saturday, when Russia launched one of the largest tank assaults on Ukrainian positions since its full-scale invasion began, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/03/31/the-russian-army-just-launched-the-biggest-tank-assault-of-the-war/?sh=9703d7e6e67a" target="_blank">only to have the column smashed by Ukraine&#8217;s 25th Brigade</a>, which took out a dozen tanks and 8 infantry fighting vehicles — a third of the column’s strength.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1024" height="689" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/GettyImages-2006699753-1024x689.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4529055" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/GettyImages-2006699753.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/GettyImages-2006699753.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Everything now depends on where Russia will decide to target its strength in an offensive that’s expected to launch this summer | Genya Savilov/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>However, the  high-ranking Ukrainian officers reminded that relying on Russian errors is not a strategy,  and they were  bitter about the missteps they say hamstrung Ukraine’s resistance from the start — missteps made by both the West and Ukraine. They were also scathing about Western foot-dragging, saying supplies and weapons systems came too late and in insufficient numbers to make the difference they otherwise could have.</p>



<p>“Zaluzhny used to call it ‘the War of One Chance,’” one of the officers said. “By that, he meant weapons systems become redundant very quickly because they’re quickly countered by the Russians. For example, we used Storm Shadow and SCALP cruise missiles [supplied by Britain and France] successfully — but just for a short time. The Russians are always studying. They don&#8217;t give us a second chance. And they’re successful in this.”</p>



<p>“Don’t believe the hype about them just throwing troops into the meat grinder to be slaughtered,” he added. “They do that too, of course — maximizing even more the impact of their superior numbers — but they also learn and refine.”</p>



<p>The officers said the <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-countries-urged-to-supply-more-weapons-to-ukraine/6403496.html" target="_blank">shoulder-fired anti-tank missiles</a> supplied by the U.K. and U.S. in the first weeks of the invasion came in time, helping them save Kyiv — and so, too, did the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/11/12/wests-himars-opened-door-ukraines-liberation-kherson/" target="_blank">HIMARS</a>, the light multiple-launch rocket systems, which were used to great effect, enabling them to push Russia out of Kherson in November 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But often, we just don’t get the weapons systems at the time we need them — they come when they’re no longer relevant,” another senior officer said, citing the F-16 fighter jets as an example. A dozen or so F-16s are expected to be operational this summer, after basic pilot training has been completed. “Every weapon has its own right time. F-16s were needed in 2023; they won’t be right for 2024,” he said.</p>



<p>And that’s because, according to this officer, Russia is ready to counter them: “In the last few months, we started to notice missiles being fired by the Russians from Dzhankoy in northern Crimea, but without the explosive warheads. We couldn’t understand what they were doing, and then we figured it out: They’re range-finding,” he said. The officer explained that Russia’s been calculating where best to deploy its S-400 missile and radar systems in order to maximize the area they can cover to target the F-16s, keeping them away from the front lines and Russia’s logistical hubs.</p>



<p>The officers also said they now need more basic traditional weapons as well as drones. “We need Howitzers and shells, hundreds of thousands of shells, and rockets,” one of them told POLITICO, estimating that Ukraine needed 4 million shells and 2 million drones. “We told the Western partners all the time that we have the combat experience, we have the battlefield understanding of this war. [They] have the resources, and they need to give us what we need,” he added.</p>



<p>Europe, for its part, is trying to help Ukraine make up for its colossal disadvantage in artillery shells. And in this regard, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/czech-republic-backtracks-on-finding-cash-to-buy-800000-shells-for-ukraine/">a proposed Czech-led bulk artillery ammunition purchase</a> could bring Ukraine’s total from both within and outside the EU to around 1.5 million rounds at a cost of $3.3 billion — but that’s still short of what it needs.</p>



<p>The officers emphasized that they need many, many more men too. The country currently doesn’t have enough men on the front lines, and this is compounding the problem of underwhelming Western support.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-ukraine-war-as-ammo-runs-out-ukrainians-still-hoping-they-wont-need-that-ride/">Ukraine has yet to pull the trigger on recruitment ahead of the expected Russian push</a>, as authorities are worried about the political fallout mobilization measures might bring amid <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-faces-an-acute-manpower-shortage-with-young-men-dodging-the-draft/">draft-dodging and avoidance of conscription papers</a>. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/26/ukraine-zaluzhny-troop-mobilization/" target="_blank">Zaluzhny had already publicly called for the mobilization of more troops</a> back in December, estimating Ukraine needed at least an additional 500,000 men. The draft issue has gone back and forth ever since.</p>



<p>Then, last week, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kyivs-top-general-says-ukraine-needs-fewer-troops-than-expected-2024-03-29/" target="_blank">General Oleksandr Syrsky — Zaluzhny’s replacement — abruptly announced that Ukraine might not need quite so many fresh troops</a>. After a review of resources, the figure has been “significantly reduced,” and “we expect that we will have enough people capable of defending their motherland,” he told the Ukrinform news agency. “I am talking not only about the mobilized but also about volunteer fighters,” he said.</p>



<p>The plan is to move as many desk-bound uniformed personnel and those in noncombat roles to the front lines as possible, after an intensive three- to four-month training. But the senior officers POLITICO spoke to said that Syrsky was wrong and “playing along with narratives from politicians.” Then, on Tuesday, Zelenskyy signed some additional parts to an old mobilization law tightening the legal requirements for draft-age  Ukrainian men to register their details, and lowering the minimum age for call-up from 27 to 25.  But in Ukraine, this is just seen as tinkering. </p>



<p>&nbsp;“We don’t only have a military crisis — we have a political one,” one of the officers said. While Ukraine shies away from a big draft, “Russia is now gathering resources and will be ready to launch a big attack around August, and maybe sooner.”</p>



<p>So, Musk may not be too wide of the mark after all.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Germany describes Denis Kapustin as a top neo-Nazi, and his role in the war  is a double-edged sword for Kyiv. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>KYIV —“We’re the bad guys but fighting really evil guys,” wisecracks Denis Kapustin. </p>



<p>For now, Ukraine is willing to embrace his form of bad guy. As a Russian militant who led eye-catching paramilitary raids into Russia from Ukrainian territory this year and last, Kyiv sees Kapustin has a role to play as an ally against President Vladimir Putin.</p>



<p>But there are hazards in holding him too close. German authorities say Kapustin — sometimes known as Denis Nikitin — is “one of the most influential neo-Nazi activists” on the European continent, and that&#8217;s a godsend to Russian propagandists, who are seeking to whitewash their murderous invasion of Ukraine as an attempt to &#8220;de-Nazify&#8221; Kyiv.  </p>



<p>“Think of &#8216;The Good, the Bad&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Ugly,&#8217;” adds Kapustin, who leads the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC), the largest of three anti-Kremlin Russian militias fighting for Ukraine. “Before, you just had good guys and bad guys dressed in black in cowboy movies, and then Clint Eastwood comes along and he’s dressed in black and fighting for good,” he says.</p>



<p>Kapustin is indeed dressed in black for his discussion with POLITICO in a downtown Kyiv hotel — though his clothing is free of any neo-Nazi logos or flashes. That&#8217;s despite the fact he runs a far-right apparel line of T-shirts and caps emblazoned with white nationalist and xenophobic imagery as well as the <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-truth-about-88-new-book-reveals-secret-meaning-of-neo-nazi-codes-a-770820.html" target="_blank">Nazi symbol 88</a> — the eighth letter of the alphabet twice being a not-so-subtle code for &#8220;Heil Hitler.&#8221;</p>



<p>“I walk a thin line,” Kapustin says, disputing the neo-Nazi label and noting, almost teasingly, that he doesn’t put swastikas on any of the T-shirts he flogs, as though that proves anything.</p>



<p>Russian state <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/572395-key-right-wing-extremist/" target="_blank">media relish pointing to Kapustin&#8217;s origins</a> as a far-right football hooligan as it bolsters their pretext for the war. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="680" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/GettyImages-2095057157-1024x680.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4528851" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/GettyImages-2095057157.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/GettyImages-2095057157.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ukraine-based anti-Putin paramilitary groups — Freedom of Russia Legion and the newest formation, the Siberian Battalion — are in the news again after launching on March 12 their biggest cross-border raids of the war | Anatolii Stepano/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>Moscow&#8217;s continual attempt to cast their struggle as a rerun of World War II  against Nazism rings hollow in reality, however. Not only is Ukraine&#8217;s president Jewish but far-right extremist parties have near negligible support in national representative politics.   </p>



<p>If that weren&#8217;t enough, Moscow&#8217;s insistence that Ukraine&#8217;s forces are Nazis overlooks the fact that <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russian-neo-nazis-fighting-ukraine/31871760.html" target="_blank">avowed neo-Nazi groups are fighting for Russia too</a>. Including <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/future-frontlines/blogs/wagner-group-contingent-rusich-on-the-move-again/" target="_blank">the notorious Rusich militia</a>, which happily displays Nazi flashes, advocates racist ideology and has been accused of battlefield atrocities in Ukraine and Syria, and the white supremacist Russian Imperial Movement, <a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/united-states-designates-russian-imperial-movement-and-leaders-as-global-terrorists/" target="_blank">designated a “terrorist organization”</a> by the United States.</p>



<p>In 2022, Germany’s BND intelligence service said the Russian military has welcomed neo-Nazi groups in its ranks, rendering <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/ukraine-krieg-organisierte-neonazi-gruppen-kaempfen-fuer-russland-geheimdienstbericht-a-f1632333-6801-47b3-99b9-650d85a51a52" target="_blank">“the alleged reason for the war, the so-called de-Nazification of Ukraine, absurd.”</a></p>



<p>Yet, none of that stops the Russians ignoring Nazis in their own ranks and focusing on  Kapustin, who goes by the <em>nom de guerre</em> &#8220;White Rex,&#8221; just like his clothing label. </p>



<p>Kapustin’s RVC and two other Ukraine-based anti-Putin paramilitary groups — Freedom of Russia Legion and the newest formation, the Siberian Battalion — are in the news again after launching on March 12 their biggest cross-border raids of the war around Kursk and Belgorod, remaining on Russian soil and fighting for more than two weeks. Prior to that, their biggest raid was in May 2023, when they stormed villages and towns in the Belgorod region.</p>



<p>Alexei Baranovsky of the Freedom of Russia Legion claimed at a press conference last week that the latest raids “disrupted the plans of the Russian army and caused significant damage to it.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Militias&#8217; murky status</h2>



<p>The status of these militia groupings in relation to Ukraine&#8217;s armed forces is murky.</p>



<p>Baranovsky claims his group is &#8220;a regular unit of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,&#8221; telling POLITICO at last week&#8217;s press conference: &#8220;When we are on the territory of Ukraine — we are servicemen of the Ukrainian army, equal in all rights and duties to all other servicemen of Ukraine. When we go to the territory of Russia — we are no longer Ukrainian servicemen, we are Russian citizens who have taken up arms.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some in Ukraine’s regular army frown on the tie-up between the militias (especially the RVC) and Ukraine&#8217;s military intelligence (HUR), arguing it offers the Russians a propaganda opportunity. </p>



<p>“And for what?” asked an official who sits on Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council but who asked not to be named in this article to be able to speak freely. “These militias are a sideshow. They can’t influence the war’s dynamics. Maybe they disrupt a bit behind the lines and are embarrassing for the Kremlin but that doesn’t outweigh the overall propaganda disadvantages of using them,” the official added.</p>

<p>The whole enterprise is a pet project of Kyrylo Budanov, the head of HUR. As the cross-border raids unfolded last month, Budanov praised the Russian paramilitaries as “good warriors” on a national newscast. “They’ve been helping us since the first day … <a href="https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/03/16/7446799/" target="_blank">They have fought in many of Ukraine’s hottest spots</a>. We’re going to try and help them as much as we can,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>As far as HUR sees it, their enemy’s enemy is their friend. <a href="https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/03/19/7447143/" target="_blank">According to Andriy Yusov,</a> a HUR spokesman: “Ukraine should obviously also assist those Russians who are fighting against the Putin regime to free Russia.&#8221; He said the militias don’t act in Russia on the direct orders of Kyiv, and their actions just go to show “the Kremlin is once again not in control of the situation in Russia.”</p>



<p>Maybe so, but it depends on how you define &#8220;under orders.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kapustin says the militias have freedom of action once across the border but the raids are closely coordinated with the HUR, which provides logistical assistance, vets their operational plans and arms and pays them. All three militias are formally part of the Ukrainian armed forces, enlisted in the International Legion, says Kapustin. “We are an official part of Ukrainian army but we have serious political ambitions and political agenda — to get rid of Putin,&#8221; he adds. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">From football fields to the battlefield</h2>



<p>The 40-year-old Kapustin was born in Moscow. He moved with his parents at the age of 17 to Cologne, Germany, where he quickly established a fearsome reputation as a street-brawling white-power skinhead always up for a punch-up with everyone, especially Antifa activists. He tells POLITICO he was unhappy with the move and missed his friends and felt disconnected.</p>



<p>He’s long been prominent on the European football hooliganism and far-right martial arts fight club scene — participating <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-b5005b559e574633886ebbfcdd7ec75b" target="_blank">in the riots</a> at the UEFA Euro 2016 football tournament in the French port city of Marseille. After he moved to Kyiv, Germany canceled his residency in 2019 and imposed a&nbsp;Schengen-entry ban on him for “efforts against the liberal democratic constitution.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxaqw/two-infamous-white-nationalists-still-have-a-platform-for-their-podcast-somehow" target="_blank">He has links with American neo-Nazi groups</a>, and in 2021 co-hosted a podcast with Robert Rundo, founder of the Rise Above Movement, which participated in the Charlottesville white supremacist rally. </p>



<p>Nonetheless, Kapustin bristles at being called a neo-Nazi himself, even though he is hazy about what he is. He relishes sparring with Western journalists, seeing how awkward many of them feel interviewing him, torn between disapproval of his far-right ideology and hooligan history and their sympathy for Ukraine, not wanting to put the county in a bad light for Western liberal audiences.</p>



<p>“Will you try to remain unbiased?” he asks. “It is a very funny position for you and your colleagues because you all have been trying hard to put us in a bad light for years. Neo-Nazis, racist, white supremacists, terrible guys, blah, blah, blah. And then the darkest hour in Ukraine’s modern day history arrives. And all of a sudden the eternal bad guys turn out to be brave, courageous, determined, stubborn and heroes. And they&#8217;re like, &#8216;damn, how should I write about them?&#8217;”</p>



<p>Kapustin thoroughly savors his notoriety. “Throughout my life, I always wanted to be the Hollywood-style bad guy. Darth Vader is my ultimate inspiration. At the age of seven, I watched <em>Star Wars</em>, and was like, ‘wow this guy&#8217;s so cool,’” he says.</p>



<p>So if he’s not a neo-Nazi, what is he?</p>



<p>“Definitely conservative, definitely traditionalist, definitely right wing-ish,” he says.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s easier for me to say what I detest, oppose in the modern world than to name my personal political views,” he adds. “I consider myself a big part of the right-wing movement. But when we say right-wing movement, what does that mean? Would that mean me agitating for beating up immigrants or things like that? No, I&#8217;m a grown up person. And if I had my time as a youngster fighting with immigrants on the street, that time is long gone. We were thinking the immigrant is the enemy. This is not the problem. The problem is Putin’s government,” he adds.</p>



<p>Above all, he says, he’s a Russian nationalist, hence fighting for Ukraine because Russian nationalists should be against Putin. “Being a patriot, being a nationalist, obviously means wishing the best for your own people, for your own kids, for your country. But I know exactly that Putin is the worst that could happen to Russia. So that&#8217;s why guys, my former comrades, who are fighting for him, and they consider themselves nationalist, they’re the worst enemy for me. They consider me a traitor. I consider them traitors,” he explains. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/GettyImages-1238948894-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4528809" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/GettyImages-1238948894.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/GettyImages-1238948894.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Moscow&#8217;s continual attempt to cast their struggle as a rerun of World War II  against Nazism rings hollow in reality. | Loic Venance/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>For Kapustin, Putin&#8217;s regime is not nationalistic enough.  He complains: &#8220;You can have a French National Football Association in Russia &#8230; But you can never have a truly Russian one. Whenever you say, I want to start a Russian national club for something you get told, &#8216;Your grandfather was fighting against Nazis and now you are a neo-Nazi!'&#8221; </p>



<p>On a trip to South Africa, Kapustin claims he found that most people thought life was better under Apartheid — though he admits he didn&#8217;t speak to Black South Africans. </p>



<p>&#8220;My trip to South Africa was very significant for me because I realized what it used to be and what it is now, this decay, it&#8217;s obviously very pity to see that.&#8221; He  concedes, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t talk to the Blacks. So I&#8217;m being open. I was just saying how it was.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kapustin started the RVC with just five members. Like the commanders of the other two Ukrainian-based Russian militias, the Freedom of Russia Legion and Siberian Battalion, he won’t say how many fighters he has now, though Russia last month said more than 2,000 fighters were involved in the raids in Kursk and Belgorod.</p>



<p>“We are an official part of Ukrainian army but we have serious political ambitions and political agenda — to march to Moscow and dismantle the Putin regime. That is obviously in the interests of Ukraine,&#8221; Kapustin says.  He doesn&#8217;t explain what system of government he would like to see in Russia. </p>



<p>“We are now definitely a sizable force, possessing our own arms and vehicles, possessing our own mortars, heavy machine guns and artillery. RVC is not anymore a gang. It is a regiment. We have bases. We have our recruitment system,” Kapustin says. </p>



<p>The original core of the RVC comprised Russians already living in Ukraine before Putin launched his full-scale invasion in February 2022. Kapustin says most recruits now are Russians who travel through Georgia to enlist. “They&#8217;re not Russian army defectors on the whole,” he says.</p>



<p>He says the three militias have different political stances. “And because of that we do have different approaches to recruitment, to how we run our units. We have lectures in ideology in my corps, not just military craft, not just physical education, because from my point of view ideology is something that fortifies a unit,” he says.</p>



<p>“One of your colleagues tried to corner me recently and asked if we would take a Black, or homosexual or transgender who wanted to join the corps. And I said: &#8216;No, because he wouldn’t feel comfortable around us, and we would not feel comfortable around him.&#8217;”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This week's meeting of the EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council could be its last.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LEUVEN, Belgium — In this medieval city just east of Brussels, American and European officials have one question on their minds: What to do about Donald Trump?</p>



<p>Over a two-day summit this week focused on trade and technology, the likes of U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and European Commission trade czar Valdis Dombrovskis will flaunt the rekindled transatlantic friendship.</p>



<p>According to a draft communiqué seen by POLITICO, they <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/177742" target="_blank">will announce joint support</a> for next generation telecommunication and semiconductor projects. They will champion so-called sustainable trade practices and stronger links around transatlantic supply chains. And they will coordinate more closely on artificial intelligence standards to push back against China and corral new forms of the technology made famous by OpenAI’s ChatGPT.</p>



<p>Yet, privately, European Union and United States officials acknowledge this week’s gathering of the EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council, or TTC, has become a hostage to fortune.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The European Commission’s point people — including Dombrovskis and Margrethe Vestager, the bloc’s digital chief — will change after the bloc’s parliamentary elections in June even if its president, Ursula von der Leyen, is expected to secure a second term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More importantly, a prospective Trump administration would almost certainly push an “American First” agenda — one that he championed vocally during his first term, and that Joe Biden’s administration has continued, albeit in a less confrontational manner.</p>



<p>These shifting political winds will buffet this week’s gathering in Leuven.&nbsp;As part of a draft of this week’s joint statement, both sides said they would now seek outsiders’ opinions to “build on the foundation of the TTC for future administrations.”</p>



<p>Amid photo ops and announcements, policymakers and politicians are seeking a legacy for renewed transatlantic ties that were strained to breaking point in Trump’s first term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Others wonder aloud how a change in the White House might alter the EU-U.S. relationship, which has become embroiled in trade feuds over steel and how much the West <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/china-eu-us-trade-technology-council-summit/">should collectively combat</a> China’s technological advances.</p>



<p>“There’s no political differences between the Republicans or Democrats when it comes to trade and technology,” said Phil Hogan, a former EU trade commissioner who helped to broach closer ties between Brussels and Washington in the final stages of Trump’s tenure in the White House.</p>



<p>“The only difference is the tactics,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Whatever you do, don’t mention Trump</h3>



<p>Over the two-day summit that starts Thursday — in a Belgian town that hosts a world-leading semiconductor research lab — leaders will highlight how the twice-yearly event has improved transatlantic diplomacy without name-checking the political storms that lie ahead.</p>



<p>In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago, U.S. and EU trade officials, working via the transatlantic body, fast-tracked joint sanctions against the Kremlin that entered force within weeks. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="700" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/03/GettyImages-996942026-1024x700.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4531443" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/03/GettyImages-996942026.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/03/GettyImages-996942026.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amid photo ops and announcements, policymakers and politicians are seeking a legacy for renewed transatlantic ties that were strained to breaking point in Trump’s first term. | Sean Gallup/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>After Vestager shared a two-page memo last May with Gina Raimondo, the U.S. Commerce Secretary, on policing so-called generative artificial intelligence, those discussions morphed into a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/g7-leaders-statement-on-the-hiroshima-ai-process/#:~:text=We%20believe%20that%20our%20joint,common%20good%20worldwide%2C%20including%20in" target="_blank">collective G7 response</a>, made public within months.</p>



<p>From sustainable trade to cybersecurity standards, officials and outside experts agree Brussels and Washington are more aligned, even as disputes over EU digital regulation and the U.S. so-called critical raw materials simmer.</p>



<p>“It’s been very successful,” said Daniel Mullaney, the former top U.S. negotiator on trade issues with Europe, of the TTC. “We’ve had high-level attention, including at the presidential levels, on all of these issues. That’s kept the momentum going.”</p>



<p>The question now is what happens if Trump wins back the White House in November. Even if Biden holds on for a second term, his economic agenda known as “Bidenomics” centers on government subsidies for local industries and a growing wariness of the global trading order.</p>



<p>Current officials dismiss those concerns, claiming Washington will  always work closely with allies.</p>



<p>“Whomever is going to sit in the White House or in the Berlaymont building will have to factor in the fact that this trade and economic relationship between the US and EU is just too important,” said Leopoldo Rubinacci, deputy director general at the European Commission’s trade department.</p>



<p>Still, Trump, now the Republican presidential nominee, has warned that he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/06/trump-trade-war-foreign-leaders-00139852" target="_blank">would impose a 10 percent tariff</a> on all imports. In his first term, Trump also slapped tariffs on many European goods, and used the State Department to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/04/trump-europe-5g-466016" target="_blank">browbeat EU allies</a> into turning against Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant.</p>



<p>If history is anything to go by, a new MAGA administration would not bode well for transatlantic ties.</p>



<p>In the build-up to the U.S. presidential election in 2020, for instance, Brussels’ overtures to the Trump administration to start the TTC were mostly ignored. It was only during the early days of Biden’s White House — with its <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2023/09/15/biden-claims-americas-back-the-world-isnt-convinced-00116375" target="_blank">“America is Back” messaging</a> — that rekindling the transatlantic relationship became a priority.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">TTC revamp</h3>



<p>Be it Biden or Trump, officials acknowledge the TTC needs a makeover.</p>



<p>Many concede that planning for the twice-yearly summits has slowed everything down. On thorny issues like the fight over steel tariffs, these regular meetings have proved fruitless despite closer personal ties between top officials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Global events like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Hamas attacks on Israel have often veered meetings into wider geopolitical discussions, according to four EU and U.S. officials granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.</p>



<p>For some, the TTC has tried to achieve too much. “Perhaps we should focus a little bit more on concrete issues, as having 10 working groups and some sub-groups might be overloading it a bit,” said Bernd Lange, head of the European Parliament’s trade committee, referring to the complex format of this week’s summit.</p>



<p>In the buildup, officials have toyed with changing these ad hoc meetings into a so-called Trade and Investment Framework Agreement. Such a format — which Washington <a href="https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/trade-investment-framework-agreements" target="_blank">has established</a> with other countries — would formalize talks without leading to full-blown trade trade agreements negotiations.</p>



<p>But after the failure of free trade negotiations under the aborted Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, there’s little appetite for such a formal structure, particularly among civil society groups wary of the impact of such trade pacts on consumer rights.</p>



<p>Others argue that, for the TTC to survive political changes, it needs to be embedded in law — and become less political.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bill Echikson, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, a think tank, said Brussels and Washington should create an apolitical secretariat to continue its work, no matter who resided in either the White House or the Berlaymont building, the Commission’s headquarters in Brussels.</p>



<p>“Whether this would be enough to survive Donald Trump’s arrival in the White House, if that happens, I don’t know,” he said. “But it’s worth a try.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[European allies should shoulder their fair share of NATO’s collective burden and demonstrate readiness to take more responsibility for Europe’s defense.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Annalena Baerbock is the federal minister for foreign affairs of Germany. Stéphane Séjourné is the minister of Europe and foreign of affairs of France. Radosław Sikorski is the minister of foreign affairs of Poland.</em></p>



<p>Seventy-five years ago, NATO’s founding treaty was signed in Washington to ensure the security of our territory, the safety of our people and the preservation of our common values: individual liberty, human rights, democracy and rule of law.</p>



<p>Since then, NATO has become the most successful defense alliance in history, guaranteeing the freedom of 32 member countries in Europe and North America.</p>



<p>But today, these values are being tested like never before.</p>



<p>For more than two years, Russia hasn’t just been waging an unjustified and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has also been making clear, time and again, turning his back on decades of approaches for cooperation, that his imperial ambition reaches far beyond Ukraine — that what he’s attacking is the European peace order itself.</p>



<p>Hence, while celebrating NATO’s anniversary, we must not turn complacent. Rather, we must live up to the fact that this moment may define the future our children will live in.</p>



<p>Over the past two years, Europe and North America have stood united and steadfast against Russian aggression. Together, we supported Ukraine’s self-defense with over €200 billion in assistance, with the EU and its member countries providing roughly two-thirds of the overall assistance approved for Kyiv so far.</p>



<p>Our support will continue for as long as it takes, and as intensively as needed.</p>



<p>We are supporting Ukraine to defend our freedom and security — but we are also investing in our own strength in Europe. We should make no mistake: Today, Ukraine is under attack — tomorrow, it may be some other part of Europe. And Russia will not cease its aggressive and imperialist politics for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>That is why, on its 75th anniversary, we reiterate NATO’s founding principle: An attack against one of us is considered an attack against all. One for all and all for one. Together, we will defend every inch of NATO territory and stand united against any future Russian aggression.</p>



<p>For years, Putin has spread lies and false narratives to justify his war. One of these narratives is that NATO represents a threat to Russia. But the opposite is true: Today, nations are again joining NATO because they feel threatened by Russia. Finland and Sweden had long held a proud tradition of neutrality. However, following Putin’s invasion of a peaceful neighbor, they exercised their sovereign right to freely choose alliances and have now fortified our ranks.</p>



<p>For Europe to be at peace, Russian imperialism must be stopped. We cannot allow for any “gray zones” because Putin sees them as an invitation to undermine territorial integrity and sovereignty, draw imaginary lines on the map and, ultimately, use military force. His full-scale invasion of Ukraine has also proven that a policy of concessions vis-à-vis Russia, in the hopes that it could bring peace or stability back to the Continent, is naive.</p>



<p>This is why European allies should shoulder their fair share of NATO’s collective burden and demonstrate readiness to take more responsibility for Europe’s defense. The enduring transatlantic bond remains the bedrock of our security, and we Europeans must address some of the most urgent shortcomings that have become painfully obvious during the past months and years: capability gaps, the readiness of our forces, production capacity, logistics, standardization and interoperability.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/GettyImages-2075743478-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4529379" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/GettyImages-2075743478.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/GettyImages-2075743478.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Flags of NATO member countries outside NATO headquarters on March 11, 2024 in Brussels | Omar Havana/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>The U.S. has long taken on more of the burden than the rest of our Alliance. But collective defense is our collective effort. In that respect, we reaffirm the importance of a stronger and more capable European defense — one that contributes positively to global and transatlantic security and is both complementary to and interoperable with NATO.</p>



<p>To take on this greater responsibility for our joint security, we European allies should take the following steps:</p>



<p>First, spending a minimum of 2 percent of GDP on defense is a necessary prerequisite and the very foundation on which we build our collective defense. Our three countries are meeting this goal this year, however these numbers can only be a starting point. We also need to make sure we spend our funds strategically — above all, for developing the forces and capabilities &nbsp;we need for collective defense.</p>



<p>Second, we need to utilize our Continent’s full industrial potential to upgrade our military capabilities, ramp up production and harvest economies of scale. Our national defense industries are key to this. They need binding long-term contracts — with clear timelines, a level of ambition, fixed financial commitments and purchase guarantees from our governments.</p>



<p>Third, we need to invest in future technologies to maintain our technological edge and close capability gaps. Our innovation efforts will help NATO maintain its technological advantage over potential adversaries and strengthen its deterrence and defense.</p>



<p>Many of these necessary tools are already at our disposal — from the European Defense Fund to the European Peace Facility and the European Investment Bank. Meanwhile, others are being developed to strengthen the European defense technological and industrial base. We need to build on them and reap their full potential to strengthen the European pillar in contributions to NATO. In the context of rising threats and security challenges, we reiterate the EU’s commitment to increasing its overall defense readiness and capabilities to match its needs and ambition.</p>



<p>Two years into his war of aggression, Putin is basing his strategy on the miscalculation that he can wear down Ukraine and outlast our support. He also aims to test our unity and resolve as allies. Thus, strength, unity and cooperation must guide our response. We must make sure his aggression does not pay off — neither now nor in the future. And on NATO’s 75th anniversary, we stand convinced: Freedom and security for the years to come require a modern and forceful transatlantic alliance.</p>



<p>As Europeans, we are ready to do our part. &nbsp;</p>
