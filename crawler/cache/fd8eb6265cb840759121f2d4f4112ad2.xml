					<description><![CDATA[An internal probe from Israel revealed significant errors and protocol violations that led to multiple strikes on the aid convoy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chef José Andrés described Israel’s siege of Gaza as a “war against humanity itself,” days after the Israeli attack that killed seven workers from World Central Kitchen, Andrés’ aid organization that provides meals to civilians suffering from hunger due to conflicts.</p>



<p>“This doesn’t seem [to be] a war against terror. This doesn’t seem anymore [to be] a war about defending Israel. The Israelis at this point seem it’s a war against humanity itself,” Andrés said during an interview on ABC’s “This Week,” that aired Sunday.</p>



<p>The Monday attack sparked widespread international anger, including from President Joe Biden who said he was “outraged and heartbroken” by the killings, and later warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that U.S. policy toward its main ally in the Middle East&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/04/biden-tells-netanyahu-the-us-policy-hinges-on-israels-immediate-action-00150614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hinges on a swift response</a>&nbsp;from Israeli forces in the region to ease the humanitarian crisis. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby declined to say what specific changes the U.S. could implement during an interview Sunday.</p>



<p>“I don’t want to get ahead of the president,” Kirby said following Andrés’ appearance on ABC. “We need to see change over time.”</p>



<p>An&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/israeli-military-forces-admit-serious-mistake-killing-7-food-aid-world-central-kitchen-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internal probe from the IDF</a>&nbsp;published Friday revealed significant errors and protocol violations that led to multiple strikes on an aid convoy. According to Israel’s military, “those who approved the strike were convinced that they were targeting armed Hamas operatives and not WCK employees.”</p>



<p>But Andrés questioned the results of the investigation, and called for deeper, independent inquiries into the incident.</p>



<p>“I would say that the perpetrator cannot be investigating himself,” Andrés said during the ABC interview.</p>



<p>“But I would say we need more information. We need to see better quality videos. We need to be saying what [were] the conversations, the radio conversation between the different officers and soldiers in charge of saying that those cars were a target because they were an imminent threat.”</p>



<p>Andrés also disputed Israel’s claims that officers could not see the WCK logos on the convoy because it was night.</p>



<p>“I would like to see high quality of the video, high quality of the images. I’m very sure that probably those logos were visible,” he told ABC’s Martha Raddatz. It was “obvious” he later added, that the WCK convoy was deliberately attacked, given that the group had been coordinating its movements with the IDF and that separate, subsequent strikes were approved as the workers attempted to move from one vehicle to the next to get to safety.</p>



<p>The U.S. is still weighing the results of the Israeli probe, Kirby said, but “we haven’t come to any conclusions one way or another.”</p>



<p>Andrés, whose humanitarian organization also operates in Ukraine, likened Netanyahu’s attacks on Gaza to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.</p>



<p>“It is unforgivable. I will have to live with this the rest of my life. We all will have to live with this the rest of our lives,” Andrés said. “I’ve seen firsthand what has been happening in Ukraine. Entire towns and cities being wiped out by Russia and by Putin. But Prime Minister Netanyahu is doing this exactly the same.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Israel should abide by international humanitarian law, foreign secretary says. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>British Foreign Secretary David Cameron on Sunday urged Israel to follow international humanitarian law in the wake of an Israeli attack on an aid convoy that left seven people dead. </p>



<p>Three U.K. citizens were among those killed in <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/seven-aid-workers-uk-poland-killed-gaza-strike-idf-israel-world-central-kitchen/">air strikes</a> on a convoy of food aid workers from World Central Kitchen (WCK) on Monday, an attack for which the Israeli military <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/israeli-military-forces-admit-serious-mistake-killing-7-food-aid-world-central-kitchen-workers/">admitted culpability</a>. </p>



<p>Israel has &#8220;a right to self-defense that we should support,&#8221; Cameron <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-cameron-israel-gaza-hamas-war-c7g32znnt" target="_blank">wrote</a> in an opinion piece for the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-cameron-israel-uk-war-gaza-qlqqmkzjf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-cameron-israel-uk-war-gaza-qlqqmkzjf" target="_blank">Sunday Times</a>. But the U.K.&#8217;s support to Israel is &#8220;not unconditional,&#8221; he said. </p>



<p>&#8220;We expect such a proud and successful democracy to abide by international humanitarian law, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/boris-johnson-accuses-david-cameron-wanting-victory-for-hamas-rejecting-proposal-end-british-arms-sales-israel/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/boris-johnson-accuses-david-cameron-wanting-victory-for-hamas-rejecting-proposal-end-british-arms-sales-israel/">even when challenged in this way</a>,&#8221; Cameron said.  </p>



<p>The article was published on the six-month anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack by the Hamas militant group on Israel, in which around 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken hostage. Israel&#8217;s <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/you-catch-more-mps-with-honey/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/you-catch-more-mps-with-honey/">retaliatory attacks</a> have killed more than 33,000 people in the Gaza Strip, the Gaza health ministry said on Sunday. </p>



<p>The attacks on the aid convoy last Monday triggered a backlash from <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/joe-biden-urges-egypt-qatar-to-push-hamas-on-hostage-release-deal/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/joe-biden-urges-egypt-qatar-to-push-hamas-on-hostage-release-deal/">Israel&#8217;s close allies</a>, including the U.S., with calls to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The enclave&#8217;s entire population of 2.3 million faces acute food insecurity, monitoring groups have <a href="https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipcinfo-website/alerts-archive/issue-97/en/" target="_blank">warned</a>. </p>



<p>In his op-ed, Cameron repeated a call for  the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to &#8220;allow more aid into Gaza,&#8221; and he detailed plans to bring U.K. aid supplies into the Israeli port of Ashdod. He also supported a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/aid-sent-via-cyprus-sea-corridor-reaches-gaza-population/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/aid-sent-via-cyprus-sea-corridor-reaches-gaza-population/">maritime humanitarian corridor</a> from Cyprus to Gaza, which was inaugurated last month. </p>



<p>U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden also criticized the Netanyahu government, saying on Sky News Sunday that Israel has made &#8220;big mistakes&#8221; and that &#8220;we should hold them to account for that.&#8221; </p>



<p>The ministers&#8217; remarks follow a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-urged-stop-selling-weapons-israel-killing-aid-workers-world-central-kitchen-gaza-peter-ricketts/">week of heated debate</a> in the U.K. on whether it should stop exporting arms to Israel. </p>



<p>The Israeli military on Sunday reduced its presence in the south of the Gaza Strip, withdrawing all ground troops except one brigade, according to a military spokesperson <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-withdraws-most-ground-troops-southern-gaza-spokesperson-says-2024-04-07/" target="_blank">quoted by Reuters</a>. It&#8217;s unclear what the development means for the Israeli plans for a ground operation in Rafah to defeat Hamas, a prospect about which <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/04/biden-tells-netanyahu-the-us-policy-hinges-on-israels-immediate-action-00150614" target="_blank">the U.S. has shown concerns</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ukrainian leader renews call for more US air defense systems as Russia pounds Kharkiv again.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Kyiv could run out of defensive missiles if Russia keeps up its fierce air-strike campaign, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned late Saturday, as he renewed calls for more military aid from allies.</p>



<p>&#8220;We must increase the number of long-range <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/ukrayina-rozrahovuye-na-kombinovanij-zahist-proti-kabiv-90105" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/ukrayina-rozrahovuye-na-kombinovanij-zahist-proti-kabiv-90105" target="_blank">anti-aircraft defense systems</a>,&#8221; Zelenskyy said in an interview with a Ukrainian broadcaster. He cited particularly the need for <a href="https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1776679522672202096" data-type="link" data-id="https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1776679522672202096" target="_blank">Patriot missile batteries</a>, saying 25 more of the U.S. systems would be needed. </p>



<p>&#8220;I still believe that we will be able to achieve a positive vote from the U.S. Congress&#8221; on a &nbsp;$60 billion military aid package, he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;If they keep hitting [Ukraine] every day the way they have for the last month, we <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-may-run-out-air-defence-missiles-if-russia-keeps-up-bombardment-2024-04-06/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-may-run-out-air-defence-missiles-if-russia-keeps-up-bombardment-2024-04-06/" target="_blank">might run out of missiles</a>, and the partners know it,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Zelenskyy said the situation will be &#8220;<a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/ukrayina-rozrahovuye-na-kombinovanij-zahist-proti-kabiv-90105" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/ukrayina-rozrahovuye-na-kombinovanij-zahist-proti-kabiv-90105" target="_blank">significantly improved</a>&#8221; with the arrival of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/17/f-16-us-ukraine-denmark-netherlands-00111769" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/17/f-16-us-ukraine-denmark-netherlands-00111769" target="_blank">F-16 fighter jets</a>, which are due to be <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/04/pentagon-ukraine-weapon-shipments-00150639" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/04/pentagon-ukraine-weapon-shipments-00150639" target="_blank">delivered soon</a>. &#8220;However, their quantity will be insufficient for complete protection against guided aerial bombs,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>The warning about Ukraine&#8217;s dwindling reserves follows earlier calls by the country&#8217;s leadership for <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-great-risk-front-line-collapse-war-russia/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-great-risk-front-line-collapse-war-russia/">more air-defense missiles</a>, especially the U.S. Patriot systems, to protect against Moscow&#8217;s air strikes. </p>



<p>&#8220;Give us the damn Patriots,&#8221; Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/give-us-the-damn-patriots-ukraine-needs-air-defenses-now-minister-says/">told POLITICO</a> in an interview at the end of March. “If we had enough air defense systems, namely Patriots, we would be able to protect not only the lives of our people, but also our economy from destruction,” Kuleba said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zelenskyy said on Saturday that Ukraine <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/06/ukraines-air-defence-missiles-are-running-out-zelenskiy-warns" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/06/ukraines-air-defence-missiles-are-running-out-zelenskiy-warns" target="_blank">faces choices</a> about what areas to protect. A <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68747752" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68747752" target="_blank">Russian drone attack</a> on the city of Kharkiv on Saturday killed at least seven people, local officials said. Kharkiv has suffered extensive damage from <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-overnight-drone-attacks-kharkiv-kills-five-injures-12-ukrainians/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-overnight-drone-attacks-kharkiv-kills-five-injures-12-ukrainians/">months of bombardment</a>.</p>



<p>On Friday, Zelenskyy <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-zustrivsya-z-delegaciyeyu-kongresu-ssha-90093" target="_blank">met</a> with a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers in the Chernihiv region, in northern Ukraine, in which he stressed the need for more U.S. aid. &#8220;I emphasized the vital need for the United States Congress to promptly adopt a decision to further support our state,&#8221; he <a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1776611628756177183" target="_blank">posted</a> on X, following the visit. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[The EU border agency awarded a major contract to a travel agency under investigation by the bloc's anti-fraud agency.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Europe&#8217;s border agency, Frontex, awarded a contract to a Polish travel agency despite knowing it was under investigation by the EU&#8217;s anti-fraud agency — until its Executive Director Hans Leijtens broke off the deal, according to documents seen by POLITICO and Germany&#8217;s Welt newspaper.</p>



<p>Frontex&#8217;s collaboration with the Polish travel agency started in 2019 with a deal to provide travel booking services for the Warsaw-based EU institution, which guards the European Union&#8217;s external borders and employs nearly 3,000 people.</p>



<p>That original collaboration was suspended when an economic crimes investigator working for Frontex alerted the EU institution to potential fraud by the travel agency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The claims were passed on to EU anti-fraud investigator OLAF, which started its own probe. (POLITICO and Welt, both owned by Axel Springer, aren&#8217;t naming the travel agency for legal reasons.)</p>



<p>Despite the warning signs, however, Frontex put out a new request for tenders in December 2022 and a new contract was awarded to the same Polish travel agency in 2023 to help manage the institution&#8217;s €526 million travel budget. </p>



<p>An internal Frontex document reviewed by <a href="https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/plus250891858/Die-fragwuerdigen-Partner-der-EU-Grenzschuetzer.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/plus250891858/Die-fragwuerdigen-Partner-der-EU-Grenzschuetzer.html" target="_blank">Welt</a> and POLITICO shows that the contract was awarded because other providers that participated in the bid for tenders couldn&#8217;t offer comparable services. But the document makes no mention of the investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was only after Frontex&#8217;s legal department carried out its own investigation into the travel agency, recommending the contract&#8217;s withdrawal in November 2023, that <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/new-eu-border-chief-hans-leijtens-vow-clean-up-frontex-agency-migrant-number-surge/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/new-eu-border-chief-hans-leijtens-vow-clean-up-frontex-agency-migrant-number-surge/">Executive Director Leijtens</a> signed a so-called &#8220;non-approval notice,&#8221; which cancelled the contract as well as the entire bidding process.</p>



<p>&#8220;The financial regulation [of the EU] obliges us to do this (cancel the contract) when the <a href="https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/plus250687906/Fabrice-Leggeri-Migranten-sofort-zurueckschicken-so-erklaert-der-Ex-Frontex-Chef-seinen-Plan-fuer-die-EU.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/plus250687906/Fabrice-Leggeri-Migranten-sofort-zurueckschicken-so-erklaert-der-Ex-Frontex-Chef-seinen-Plan-fuer-die-EU.html" target="_blank">irregularities</a> are blatant,&#8221; one of the internal documents reads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It remains unclear who at Frontex took the decision to award the contract in spite of the <a href="https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/plus249203786/EU-Grenzschutzbehoerde-Frontex-Dubiose-Deals-im-Visier-der-EU-Staatsanwaelte.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/plus249203786/EU-Grenzschutzbehoerde-Frontex-Dubiose-Deals-im-Visier-der-EU-Staatsanwaelte.html" target="_blank">ongoing investigations</a> and claims of fraudulent activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leijtens became Frontex&#8217;s executive director in March 2023, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/frontex-appoints-new-director-hans-leijtens-amid-anti-fraud-probe/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/frontex-appoints-new-director-hans-leijtens-amid-anti-fraud-probe/">succeeding Fabrice Leggeri</a>, who resigned from the agency in April 2022.</p>



<p>Frontex did not reply to repeated requests for comment from POLITICO and Welt. The Polish travel agency declined to comment for this article.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Victory by Peter Pellegrini gives the ruling coalition total control over the executive and legislative branches in Bratislava.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Speaker of Parliament Peter Pellegrini defeated pro-West career diplomat Ivan Korčok for the Slovak presidency in a runoff election Saturday, giving Prime Minister Robert Fico&#8217;s ruling coalition total control over the executive and legislative branches of government.</p>



<p>With virtually all of the ballots counted, Pellegrini had 53 percent of the vote, while Korčok received 47 percent.</p>



<p>&#8220;This victory is an enormous vindication for me,&#8221; Pellegrini said.</p>



<p>Fico called the outcome an &#8220;overwhelming victory&#8221; and a &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/PM_ViktorOrban/status/1776899085183643701" data-type="link" data-id="https://twitter.com/PM_ViktorOrban/status/1776899085183643701" target="_blank">big win</a> for the people&#8221; of Slovakia.</p>



<p>In Slovakia, the president has limited powers that include appointing ambassadors, returning legislation to parliament and issuing amnesties. </p>



<p>But the hardball campaign waged by Pellegrini and his supporters attested to the importance that Fico&#8217;s coalition government — which includes Pellegrini&#8217;s Hlas (Voice) party — put on controlling the presidency as well as the rest of the executive branch. Korčok denounced the aggressive campaign tactics of the Pellegrini camp.</p>



<p>After Korčok beat him <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/coalition-stalwart-edges-pro-eu-opponent-in-first-round-slovak-presidential-ballot/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/coalition-stalwart-edges-pro-eu-opponent-in-first-round-slovak-presidential-ballot/">by five percentage points</a> in the first round of the election two weeks ago, Pellegrini promised on March 24 to &#8220;maintain decency&#8221; and &#8220;not to descend into aggressive tactics&#8221; ahead of Saturday&#8217;s runoff.</p>



<p>But a mere two days later, Fico <a href="https://www.teraz.sk/slovensko/premier-korcok-je-vojnovy-stvacp/784131-clanok.html" target="_blank">denounced</a> Korčok as &#8220;a warmonger who unhesitatingly supports everything the West tells him, including dragging Slovakia into [the Russia-Ukraine] war.&#8221; <strong> </strong></p>



<p>Korčok, who has previously served as Slovakia&#8217;s foreign minister as well as its permanent representative to the EU, protested that it was actually Fico&#8217;s government and parliamentary majority, not the president, that had <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/knives-out-for-von-der-leyen/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/knives-out-for-von-der-leyen/">the power to declare war</a> under the country&#8217;s constitution. </p>



<p>The opposition-backed Korčok said he saw no reason to send Slovak soldiers to fight in neighboring Ukraine, but <a href="https://www.cas.sk/clanok/2900927/korcok-upozornuje-cim-viac-bude-ukrajina-prehravat-tym-blizsie-bude-vojna-k-nasim-hraniciam/" target="_blank">added that he supported</a> Kyiv in its war against invading Russian forces because &#8220;Ukraine&#8217;s security increases our own security &#8230; It&#8217;s clear that if Ukraine loses the war, it brings war that much closer to our own border.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then it was the turn of Erik Tomáš, minister of social affairs and a member of Pellegrini&#8217;s party, who <a href="https://www.novinky.cz/clanek/volby-ministr-obvinil-ivana-korcoka-z-ucasti-na-antisocialnich-zverstvech-40465719" target="_blank">said at a March 27 press conference</a>: &#8220;I want to tell people, seniors and all at-risk groups, that if Korčok becomes president and this government falls, you will lose all your social benefits.&#8221; </p>



<p>Tomáš did not explain how Korčok could cause the government to fall or what power the presidency had over social benefits, which are approved by Tomáš&#8217; own ministry.</p>



<p>Speaking at the same press conference, Pellegrini harked back to the Covid-19 pandemic, which unfolded during the previous 2020-2023 government in which Korčok served as foreign minister. Also siding with pensioners, Pellegrini said that &#8220;during the pandemic, they were locked up at home &#8230; they froze the minimum pensions, on which you can barely survive, and for several years they did not increase them even by a penny.&#8221;</p>



<p>Tomáš then announced a one-time payment of €300 to pensioners &#8220;as compensation and recompense for all these damages,&#8221; as well as a Christmas pension bonus of €600.</p>



<p>Defense Minister Robert Kaliňák on March 28 <a href="https://dennikn.sk/3911027/kalinak-rozdava-par-dni-pred-volbami-mimoriadne-odmeny-vojakom-aj-uradnikom/" target="_blank">announced</a> that some 20,000 Slovak soldiers and ministry employees would be receiving a €500 spring bonus. Not to be outdone, Interior Minister Matúš Šutaj Eštok — also a member of Pellegrini&#8217;s Hlas party — <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SutajEstokM/" target="_blank">announced</a> on social media that almost 24,000 police and firefighters would be receiving a €500 bonus in their next pay packets as well. </p>



<p>&#8220;For sure this happened just before the second round of presidential elections because they have such respect for our armed services,&#8221; <a href="https://spravy.pravda.sk/domace/clanok/705570-po-vojakoch-stat-da-500-eurove-odmeny-aj-policajtom-ci-hasicom-vnutro-ale-vyplatene-budu-az-po-volbach/?utm_source=pravda&amp;utm_medium=hp-box&amp;utm_campaign=shp_9clanok_box" target="_blank">said</a> Juraj Krupa, an MP for the opposition Freedom and Solidarity (SaS) party. &#8220;For sure it has nothing at all to do with election corruption.&#8221;</p>



<p>On April 5, a day before the final vote, members of Pellegrini&#8217;s party shared doctored images of a frail older woman embracing a man in military fatigues, with the caption: &#8220;Come out and vote. Don&#8217;t let Slovak sons and grandsons die in war.&#8221; </p>



<p>Blogger Jakub Goda <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jakub.goda.9/posts/pfbid033g5ok37BdSTeUHy3RY1FYJ36HEVVikmLAJNZzuTWh12SDnRgc7BQ1oUAV8PntADol" target="_blank">flagged</a> that in the original image from 2022, the soldier had been wearing a blue-and-yellow Ukrainian (i.e. not Slovak) shoulder patch, which had been photoshopped out.</p>



<p>&#8220;We see now that someone can win the presidency without running a transparent campaign,&#8221; Korčok said late Saturday. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen that the presidency can be won by someone who spreads hatred and inflames [voter passions], and accuses his opponent of being a war candidate.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[MP Luke Evans reveals he received explicit content in personal messages in Westminster sexting scandal.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>British Conservative member of parliament Luke Evans revealed that he’s among the U.K. politicians targeted in the sexting scandal first reported by <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-parliament-naked-photos-phishing-attacks-mps-staff/">POLITICO</a> on Tuesday.</p>



<p>Evans is the second parliamentarian to go public about receiving alluring personal messages and explicit images, following senior Conservative MP William Wragg — who <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/westminster-honey-trap-scandal-uk-tory-mp-admits-sharing-numbers/">admitted</a> on Thursday that he gave some phone numbers to a man he met on the dating app Grindr who had “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/westminster-honey-trap-scandal-extremely-troubling-says-treasury-minister-gareth-davies/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/westminster-honey-trap-scandal-extremely-troubling-says-treasury-minister-gareth-davies/">compromising things on me</a>.” </p>



<p>Evans appears to be the lawmaker who first alerted authorities to the phishing attacks.</p>



<p>“A month ago,” Evans said in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/964748515251154" target="_blank">a video</a> posted on Facebook on Friday, “I was a victim of cyber flashing and malicious communications and blew the whistle by reporting it to the police and the parliamentary authorities as soon as this happened.”</p>



<p>The MP then told the story of the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-parliament-westminster-honey-trap-scandal-naked-pictures-whatsapp-phishing-mps-takeaways/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-parliament-westminster-honey-trap-scandal-naked-pictures-whatsapp-phishing-mps-takeaways/">first suspicious message</a> he received while he was with his wife: “I got a one-time open photo on WhatsApp of an explicit image of a naked lady.”</p>



<p>“The next day I reported it to the police, the authorities and the chief whip,” he explained.</p>



<p>The second set of malicious messages came 10 days later. This time the politician was with his team, “so we were able to record the conversation and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/drlukeevansmp" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.facebook.com/drlukeevansmp" target="_blank">catch photos and videos</a> of the messages coming through including another explicit female image.”</p>



<p>Evans also explained why he didn&#8217;t go public until now. “I wanted it to be private because it’s an ongoing police investigation [that has] been ongoing for a month,” he said.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Leicestershire Police and London&#8217;s Metropolitan Police <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/westminster-online-scam-police-launch-inquiry-into-uk-parliament-honey-trap-scandal/">confirmed</a> they were investigating reports of <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-parliament-westminster-honey-trap-scandal-naked-pictures-whatsapp-phishing-mps-takeaways/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-parliament-westminster-honey-trap-scandal-naked-pictures-whatsapp-phishing-mps-takeaways/">malicious communications</a>.</p>



<p>Since the Westminster sexting scandal broke, “I’ve been hounded by journalists asking me about it. It’s not too difficult to work out, there are only a few Leicestershire MPs,” Evans added.</p>



<p>“I’m just pleased I blew the whistle, reported it to the authorities and it’s now being looked into,” he said.</p>



<p>POLITICO previously reported how a serving minister plus multiple MPs, party staffers and political journalists were among those <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-parliament-naked-photos-phishing-attacks-mps-staff/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-parliament-naked-photos-phishing-attacks-mps-staff/">who received unsolicited messages</a> — sometimes called a&nbsp;“spear phishing attack”— from two suspicious mobile numbers sent by users calling themselves “Abi” or “Charlie.”</p>



<p>William Wragg, chairman of the Commons public administration committee, was the first to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-parliament-westminster-honey-trap-scandal-naked-pictures-whatsapp-phishing-mps-takeaways/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-parliament-westminster-honey-trap-scandal-naked-pictures-whatsapp-phishing-mps-takeaways/">publicly confirm</a> being a victim of the phishing scandal. He also admitted to having given phone numbers to the perpetrator after being threatened.</p>



<p>More than 10 men are known to have received messages, with at least five reporting them to the Parliamentary Security Department, but the true number targeted <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-parliament-westminster-honey-trap-scandal-naked-pictures-whatsapp-phishing-mps-takeaways/">may never be known</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tech giant updates its rules on  payment alternatives to align with EU antitrust decision.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Apple announced late Friday that it will allow music-streaming apps in the EU to inform users of payment alternatives outside the iOS App Store — in an effort to comply with European Commission demands.</p>



<p>In early March, Apple was <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/apple-gets-e1-8b-eu-antitrust-fine-for-abusive-app-terms/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/apple-gets-e1-8b-eu-antitrust-fine-for-abusive-app-terms/">fined more than €1.8 billion</a> by EU regulators for &#8220;abusive&#8221; App Store rules that may have increased prices for streaming subscriptions.</p>



<p>EU antitrust regulators found that Apple&#8217;s restrictions prevented apps such as Spotify from informing iPhone and iPad users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside the App Store — practices the EU defined as &#8220;anti-steering provisions.&#8221;</p>



<p>Apple initially said it would appeal the EU&#8217;s fine. &#8220;While we respect the European Commission, the facts simply don’t support this decision,&#8221; Apple said in a March 4 <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/03/the-app-store-spotify-and-europes-thriving-digital-music-market/" target="_blank">statement</a>, pointing to its claim of the EU’s &#8220;failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm.&#8221;</p>



<p>But on Friday, the Cupertino-based company <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/" target="_blank">updated</a> its App Store guidelines to comply with the Commission&#8217;s requests, allowing music-streaming apps to include a link or button that leads to information about alternative music-purchase options.</p>



<p>However, the new App Store rules <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/music-streaming-services-entitlement-eea/" target="_blank">include</a> a 27 percent Apple &#8220;commission&#8221; if the sale is made within seven days of the user opening the link leading out of the App Store.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are currently assessing whether Apple has fully complied with the decision,&#8221; Commission spokesperson for competition Lea Zuber said in an emailed statement Saturday. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[US Treasury secretary's admonition comes after Blinken said China is aiding Moscow's war effort.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There will be &#8220;significant consequences&#8221; for China if its companies &#8220;support Russia&#8217;s war against Ukraine,&#8221; U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned Saturday.</p>



<p>Yellen&#8217;s statement following talks in Guangzhou came after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-solo-press-availability/" target="_blank">said</a> on Thursday at NATO headquarters in Brussels that &#8220;China continues to provide materials to support Russia&#8217;s defense industrial base.&#8221;</p>



<p>During her meetings with <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2226" target="_blank">local authorities</a> and in a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2228" target="_blank">bilateral</a> with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, Yellen &#8220;emphasized that companies, including those in the PRC [People&#8217;s Republic of China], must not provide material support for Russia&#8217;s war against Ukraine, including support to the Russian defense industrial base, and the significant consequences if they do so,&#8221; according to a statement <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240406-us-china-agree-to-hold-talks-on-balanced-economic-growth" target="_blank">reported</a> by AFP.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been clear with China that we see Russia as gaining support from goods that China, Chinese firms are supplying to Russia,&#8221; Yellen told journalists in Guangzhou.</p>



<p>&#8220;Neither of us want this to be an issue with our bilateral relationship. So we&#8217;re working together,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>Since Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine began, Beijing&#8217;s ties with Moscow have become even stronger than before the conflict, with trade between the two countries more than <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/07/business/chinas-exports-surge-at-the-start-of-2024-intl-hnk/index.html#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20China's%20exports%20to%20Russia,slipped%20to%20the%2011th%20spot." target="_blank">doubling</a> from $108 billion in 2020 to $240 billion in 2023 — making Russia China&#8217;s 10th-largest trading partner last year.</p>



<p>China is also trying to expand its market share of goods shipped to Europe and the U.S. — so Beijing has an interest in maintaining good relations with the West too. But the U.S. is increasingly worried about the cheap electric vehicles, batteries and other technologies flooding the American market despite Washington&#8217;s subsidies to its own industry, which is suffering from the Chinese competition.</p>



<p>Yellen&#8217;s talks in China on Friday and Saturday were held to &#8220;facilitate a discussion around macroeconomic imbalances, including their connection to overcapacity,&#8221; Yellen said in a statement. &#8220;I intend to use this opportunity to advocate for a level playing field for American workers and firms,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>Xie Feng, China&#8217;s ambassador to the U.S., responded that the claim of overcapacity is &#8220;untenable&#8221; because &#8220;globally, high-quality industrial capacity and new-quality productive forces are not excessive, but in dire scarcity,&#8221; he said <a href="https://twitter.com/SpoxCHNinUS/status/1776430001224643041" target="_blank">in a post on X</a> defining it as &#8220;a good thing&#8221; that China &#8220;can help the international community attain the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Paris Agreement goals.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Oslo's $152B military spending plan ranks as the most ambitious long-term commitment to security in the country's history.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ukraine war and Vladimir Putin&#8217;s aggression has transformed Western security policy in countless ways. In Norway, that transformation has a new price tag: $152 billion.</p>



<p>Norway on Friday unveiled a 12-year, $56 billion defense boost that ranks as the country&#8217;s most ambitious long-term commitment to its security in its history. The news comes as the NATO alliance faces unprecedented tests from both Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine and a U.S. election that could bring new strains to the 75-year-old group.</p>



<p>“We need a defense that is fit for purpose in the emerging security environment,&#8221; Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said in a speech Friday. &#8220;As our security environment is deteriorating, we need to spend more on and pay more attention to defense and preparedness.&#8221;</p>



<p>The two-party government that runs the country is looking to spend a total of $152 billion between now and 2036 on defense.</p>



<p>The move comes as European countries continue their yearslong hikes in defense budgets, which started slowly after Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine and seizure of Crimea, and sped up after Moscow launched its February 2022 full-scale invasion of the country.</p>



<p>Norway has had a robust defense industry for decades, producing air defense systems and missiles and rockets for itself and international customers. That includes the U.S., which co-produces and buys air defenses and munitions from the Nordic nation of 5.4 million people.</p>



<p>A day before the announcement, Norway’s deputy defense minister, Anne Marie Aanerud, previewed some of the details of the plan in an interview in Washington on Thursday with POLITICO.</p>



<p><strong>Can you give some detail on why Norway is proposing this huge spending increase, and what areas you are targeting for more funding?</strong></p>



<p>The context is that we see that we need major investments in our forces, and 12 years will allow for a longer planning cycle and more predictability.</p>



<p>Of course, what it also does is it commits the political parties in parliament over several election cycles to invest. So, while we have been working on this plan we have been working with all the political parties in parliament in order to secure broad support for it, and our goal is to have a broad majority of political parties represented in parliament voting for this plan in order for the funding to be stable over the entire duration of the plan.</p>



<p><strong>Do you think that there is broad support in parliament to put the plan into action?</strong></p>



<p>It might not sound like something extraordinary, but it&#8217;s very, very unusual that a government goes to the opposition parties in parliament and talks to them about how to make a plan before they even have designed the plan [internally]. Usually, you just make the plan and then you hand it over and they work on it. But we have a very good tradition in Norway of coming together when the stakes are high and this is definitely one of those times. We think it&#8217;s very, very important that we start building our armed forces back up.</p>



<p>My prediction is that there will be broad support in parliament for increasing [weapons] production because we see very broad parliamentary and public support for Ukraine in Norway. And we also see that more and more parties see that we need to invest more in our defense industrial base and in our armed forces, so we don&#8217;t expect this to be very controversial.</p>



<p><strong>What are the top areas you most want to invest in?</strong></p>



<p>We have prioritized four different things which are critical to Ukraine, but also to the NATO alliance. Those are high explosives — which Norway has been a key producer of — rocket engines, missiles and artillery ammunition. So those are the four areas of focus for products that we are ramping up production of, and those are all also areas where Norway plays a key role in the alliance. We are a niche producer of certain items, and these are the most important ones to the alliance right now.</p>



<p><strong>Looking toward Ukraine, obviously they need artillery ammunition. So how do these investments aid not only Norway and NATO, but in helping Ukraine fight and rebuild its own defense industrial base?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The first phase of what we are doing is we are increasing our net national production, and that will enable us to donate more. But we are at the same time giving money to the Czech initiative to buy more artillery shells for Ukraine from third party states. We&#8217;re trying to just help Ukraine in any way we can.</p>



<p>We have a five-year, $7 billion Ukraine fund set up, and the good thing about that fund is that it&#8217;s very flexible. It&#8217;s 50/50 for civil and military components in that fund. But the most important thing about the fund is that it&#8217;s supposed to answer Ukraine&#8217;s needs. So it&#8217;s very flexible.</p>



<p><strong>How is Norway contributing to the wider Ukraine Defense Contact Group effort to support Ukraine militarily?</strong></p>



<p>One of our biggest efforts is investing in artillery ammunition production [at home], but we have recently announced that we will contribute $160 million to the Czech initiative to buy more artillery from third countries to send to Ukraine.</p>



<p>We co-lead the maritime capability coalition together with the U.K., and we have announced that we will donate F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. We contribute to fighter pilot training [for Ukrainian pilots] in Denmark and we are contributing as much air defense as we can.</p>



<p>So those are our main efforts. And of course, we contribute to training Ukrainian soldiers throughout Europe as well. So there are many lines of effort and artillery ammunition is just one of them. But ammunition is an important line of effort because Nammo is one of four European producers of artillery ammunition and Nammo ramping up production will obviously be important for Ukraine.</p>



<p><strong>Given these new investments in your industrial base, when do you expect to see more material actually being available?</strong></p>



<p>When it comes to artillery ammunition, it will take somewhere from two to three years to get the newer equipment running, and they also have to build buildings to house them and all that. So two to three years, around the same when it comes to missiles. As for the high explosives, I think the timeline might be shorter — the companies have the production facilities they need for it now so they don&#8217;t really have to build it. They just have to expand production and hiring, that kind of thing.</p>



<p>It will take some time, and that&#8217;s why 2024 is going to be a difficult year for Ukraine. And that&#8217;s why the Czech initiative is so good because it&#8217;s sourcing ammunition from third-party countries. Allies have already donated a lot and some smaller countries don&#8217;t really have much more they can donate before their own stockpiles reach a critical level.</p>



<p><strong>The last several NATO gatherings have featured a lot of talk about trying to get defense companies from multiple countries to pool their efforts. Is that a way forward to speed up production?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>I think part of what we need to look at going forward is to have more of an open dialogue between countries about the situation where, at least in Europe, different countries have different industries that produce different components.</p>



<p>It’s the same value chain, and sometimes, even though one country is ramping up production, you don&#8217;t really get the effect that you&#8217;re looking for because there is a bottleneck in a company in a different country. We need international cooperation in order to solve those problems, between industry and governments.</p>



<p><strong>What is your hope or your expectation for the NATO summit in Washington in July? Where do you hope the Ukraine will be by then?</strong></p>



<p>First and foremost, I think it&#8217;s important that the alliance celebrates and shows how united and strong it is, and that we come out of that anniversary unified and that we have a really good discussion about how we can increase our industrial base production, but also move forward on other important issues.</p>



<p>So the way I see it, celebrating the strength of the organization is the most important part, showing that strength to the rest of the world.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Brussels has pledged to boost Armenia's 'resilience' as the US warns against renewed violence.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Major firefights broke out along the tense frontier between Azerbaijan and Armenia overnight Saturday, with heavy shooting reported by both sides amid Western efforts to bring peace to the war-torn South Caucasus.</p>



<p>In a statement Saturday, the Armenian Foreign Ministry reported clashes &#8220;in many parts of the border&#8221; along with &#8220;the movement of dozens of military vehicles,&#8221; alleging that the neighboring country &#8220;has clearly pursued a provocative goal.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, according to <a href="https://azertag.az/xeber/mudafie_nazirliyi_oten_sutka_erzinde_movqelerimiz_30_defe_atese_tutulub_video-2964103" target="_blank">Azerbaijan&#8217;s Defense Ministry</a>, Armenian troops have opened fire on its positions more than 30 times since Friday. Azerbaijan has <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.az/en/news/no14524" target="_blank">said</a> recent allegations — from EU countries including France — that it could be preparing to launch a new offensive against Armenia are &#8220;baseless&#8221; and &#8220;create a tension in the region and obstruct the peace process.&#8221; </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Despite certain allegations about military movements it is reassuring to know that <a href="https://twitter.com/EUmARMENIA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">@EUmARMENIA</a> is able to refute these. It also remains an untapped resource to help defuse misunderstandings and false perceptions and can provide good offices to both 🇦🇲and 🇦🇿. <a href="https://t.co/wvMTcql9j8" target="_blank">https://t.co/wvMTcql9j8</a></p>&mdash; Toivo Klaar (@ToivoKlaar) <a href="https://twitter.com/ToivoKlaar/status/1776602196131414120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">April 6, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Azerbaijan has reported Armenia is building up military equipment along the border, <a href="https://ria.ru/20240405/kadry-1938156055.html" target="_blank">publishing footage</a> that purports to show unarmored transport vehicles lining up close to the frontier. The claims have been denied by Armenia but shared widely in Russian state media, while Moscow has accused the West of attempting to &#8220;drag the South Caucasus into geopolitical confrontation.&#8221; Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought several bloody wars in recent years, with Azerbaijan emerging as the victor in each of them.</p>



<p>Later on Saturday, the EU&#8217;s civilian monitoring mission on the borders&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/EUmARMENIA/status/1776595754687053942" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;that the situation is now &#8220;stable and calm.&#8221; The bloc&#8217;s observers, deployed inside the territory of Armenia under the Common Security and Defense Policy, had previously&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://x.com/EUmARMENIA/status/1774398943234871433" target="_blank">said</a>&nbsp;&#8220;no unusual movements&#8221; of troops have been observed.</p>



<p>On Friday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, with the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-launch-new-e270-million-plan-bring-armenia-fold-russia/">EU pledging more than a quarter of a billion euros</a> to support Armenia&#8217;s economy in the face of growing regional tensions and strained relations with its traditional ally, Russia. With anger building at the Kremlin for failing to support Armenia in its standoff with Azerbaijan, the Armenian government has effectively frozen its membership in Moscow&#8217;s military alliance, sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine and even hinted it could one day apply to join the EU.</p>



<p>&#8220;The European Union and the United States acknowledged the substantial progress Armenia has made since 2018 on democratic and justice reforms and the fight against corruption, and expressed a commitment to continue partnering with and supporting Armenia as it further strengthens its democracy and the rule of law, in line with our shared values and principles,&#8221; a <a href="https://www.state.gov/joint-u-s-eu-armenia-high-level-meeting-in-support-of-armenias-resilience/" target="_blank">joint statement</a> from Blinken and von der Leyen said.</p>



<p>Azerbaijan last weekend marked the &#8220;<a href="https://www.mfa.gov.az/en/news/no14024" target="_blank">Day of Genocide of Azerbaijanis</a>,&#8221; commemorating more than 100,000 Azerbaijanis who lived in Armenia prior to the fall of the Soviet Union and were expelled, with many more killed amid violence in the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh in the 1990s. In September, following a year-long blockade of its supply routes, Azerbaijan conquered the unrecognized republic after three decades of de facto autonomy,  sparking a mass exodus of its 100,000 Armenian inhabitants.</p>



<p>Ahead of the talks, Blinken&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://az.usembassy.gov/blinken-aliyev-call-apr/" target="_blank">told</a> Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev in a call “that there is no justification for increased tension on the border and cautioned that aggressive actions and rhetoric from any side would undermine prospects for peace.”</p>
