					<description><![CDATA[The Neptun Deep project to produce natural gas offshore at the Black Sea is the key to reducing dependence on gas imports and strengthening the EU’s energy security.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In an era when energy security becomes crucial for Europe, amid all the challenges posed by Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine, the exploitation of Romanian natural gas from the Black Sea’s depths emerges as a tangible factor in strengthening energy supply security, for the countries in the region, and for the entire European Union.</p>



<p>The European Union seeks solutions for sustainable transition and energy security, and Romania’s role within the EU gains increasing significance as the 2027 deadline approaches when Romania will become Europe&#8217;s number-one natural gas producer. Romania must thus embark on a new phase of its economic development, while simultaneously pursuing the climate objectives of the European Union.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Romanian natural gas from the Black Sea’s depths emerges as a tangible factor in strengthening energy supply security, for the countries in the region, and for the entire European Union.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>And the Neptun Deep natural gas production project draws attention as a focal point. Natural gas from the Black Sea should not be superficially viewed merely as a business matter in Romania, or merely as a target of ecological debates. Being a real resource for national economic growth, offshore natural gas extracted from the Black Sea will be, for the coming decades, a central piece in the puzzle of European energy security as a whole.</p>



<p>Recently, in a presentation of the Neptun Deep project at the European Parliament, the idea was emphasized that offshore gas production in the Black Sea represents a significant basis for energy supply security in the region. By harnessing the natural gas resources of the Black Sea, Europe takes important steps in reducing dependency on energy imports — &nbsp;especially from Russia — and ensuring regional energy independence. Even the president of the ITRE Committee of the European Parliament, Cristian Bușoi, highlighted the multiple advantages that the Neptun Deep project brings to the European Union: From contributing to energy transition, to supporting economic sectors and improving competitiveness. “By exploiting gas from the Black Sea, Romania contributes to Europe&#8217;s energy security and the competitiveness of European industry,” he said. “I believe that both onshore and offshore potential is important to utilize, as this can help us replace imports from Russia more rapidly, but also for the overall reduction of imports from regions with low environmental standards, such as North Africa or the Middle East. The Black Sea and Romania can become providers of energy security and will contribute to Europe&#8217;s industrial competitiveness.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Romania’s role within the EU gains increasing significance as the 2027 deadline approaches when Romania will become Europe&#8217;s number-one natural gas producer.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>With an impressive capacity of approximately 8 billion cubic meters per year, the offshore gas production project in the Black Sea thus emerges as a crucial source of natural gas for Europe. This initiative perfectly aligns with the objectives of the REpowerEU program, which aim to reduce dependence on gas imports from Russia and support the energy transition toward safer, cleaner sources. Additionally, by replacing coal and providing a constant resource to complement renewable energy, the Neptun Deep project significantly boosts decarbonization efforts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="989" height="1236" src="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=819,height=1024,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/10/Daniel-Apostol-FPPG.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4728348" style="aspect-ratio:0.7998046875;width:297px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=989,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/10/Daniel-Apostol-FPPG.jpg 989w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=240,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/10/Daniel-Apostol-FPPG.jpg 240w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=819,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/10/Daniel-Apostol-FPPG.jpg 819w" sizes="(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Daniel Apostol is the general director of the Romanian Oil and Gas Employers&#8217; Federation. | via FPPG</figcaption></figure>



<p>Producing natural gas from the deep seabed of the Black Sea is the key to reducing gas import dependence and, more importantly, to consolidating the energy security of the entire EU community: It will reduce vulnerability to fluctuations in the global natural gas market, and provide essential resources for a transition to green energy sources, in a fair and sustainable manner for citizens, the state and energy production investors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Offshore natural gas extracted from the Black Sea will be, for the coming decades, a central piece in the puzzle of European energy security as a whole.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Major investments of approximately €4 billion in the development phase of the Neptun Deep project herald a considerable production of around 100 billion cubic meters of natural gas. This exploitation promises not only substantial state revenues in the form of taxes and royalties, but also the opportunity to direct these funds toward key sectors of the Romanian economy and society. Success in producing natural gas from the Black Sea does not only boil down to figures on paper, but can lead to a significant increase in local economic activity, generating jobs and stimulating related industries such as construction and services. Therefore, integrating natural gas from the Black Sea into the domestic energy mix is the cornerstone of the country&#8217;s energy future, essential for diversification and national resilience.</p>



<p>But exploiting this resource also opens doors to regional collaboration, strengthening cross-border relations and contributing to regional stability. Romania cannot remain passive in European energy decisions. Through active involvement in EU initiatives, Romania can become an influential player in shaping the European energy future, contributing to the formulation of clear directions in community energy governance. Thus, Romania, with its complex geography and rich history, faces a turning point regarding its energy and economic future within the European Union.</p>



<p>And natural gas from the Black Sea is not just an economic resource for Romania — it is a vital factor in consolidating the energy security of the EU as a whole.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Rachel Goldberg-Polin also said she doesn’t know what could end the brutal war.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The mother of an Israeli-American hostage being held in Gaza said Sunday that the United States has a stake in bringing about a deal that will lead to a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas and the release of the Oct. 7 hostages.</p>



<p>“I think what really gets lost in this is that America should not be considered sort of this neutral, you know, negotiator,” Rachel Goldberg-Polin said on “Fox News Sunday.” “America was also a victim on October 7th. Forty-five Americans were killed on October 7th. Twelve were taken into captivity and eight are still being held hostage.”</p>



<p>Goldberg-Polin is the mother of 23-year-old Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was abducted from a music festival in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. In April, Hamas released a hostage video of her son, who was born in Berkeley, California.</p>



<p>The exact number is not 100 percent clear, but in addition to approximately 1,200 Israelis being killed by Hamas that day, more than 230 people were known to have been abducted from southern Israel. While some were released in prisoner exchanges (and at least three killed by friendly fire from Israeli forces), many hostages — Goldberg-Polin said 132 — are still known to be in Gaza.</p>



<p>“I think that not most Americans even are aware that there are American innocent civilians being held against their will,” she told host Benjamin Hall, adding that the group includes a range of nationalities and religions.</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of people in that hostage cohort that we don’t hear about when we hear a lot of noise about the hostages being held,” Goldberg-Polin said. “You very rarely hear about the Muslim Arabs who are hostage. You very rarely hear about the Thai Buddhists who are held hostage. You very rarely hear about the Black Christian Africans who are being held hostage. There’s Nepalese. There are Mexicans. There are Argentinians. There are Germans. And somehow there has been an attempt to make this group of people a monolithic, homogenous group.”</p>



<p>The Oct. 7 attack led to an attack on Gaza by Israel that continues to this day and which has claimed an estimated 35,000 lives, including thousands of children. Recent ceasefire talks have failed to yield a deal, and Israel has ramped up an offensive in the densely populated city of Rafah, which is believed to be Hamas’ last stronghold.</p>



<p>Goldberg-Polin said she wasn’t sure could be done to stop the fighting.</p>



<p>“I think that we really have to be creative and insightful,” she said, “and figure out a way forward. Both sides really have to figure out a way forward and calling for a timeout certainly will give some time for people to start to think straight again.”</p>



<p>She added about the war: “There’s so much suffering to go around — I mean, there is no competition here. There are hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians in Gaza who are suffering, and there are also 132 innocent civilians in Gaza who were dragged there on October 7th who are suffering. I think people have trouble holding those two truths.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Haley has yet to throw her support behind Trump and has continued to pick up notable support in primary races.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Former President Donald Trump on Saturday shot down reports that he was weighing Nikki Haley as his running mate.</p>



<p>“Nikki Haley is not under consideration for the V.P. slot, but I wish her well!”&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112423102502717689" target="_blank">Trump posted on Truth Social</a>.</p>



<p>Trump threw cold water on the idea after&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/05/11/trump-moves-haley-off-blacklist-2024-election" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axios reported Saturday morning</a>&nbsp;that his campaign was actively considering Haley to help the former president in his bid to win back the White House, both by attracting college-educated voters and helping repair his fundraising disadvantage with President Joe Biden. But the relationship between Trump and Haley has remained icy since the former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor dropped out of the race after Super Tuesday.</p>



<p>Haley has yet to endorse Trump and has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/11/nikki-haley-voters-00157455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continued to pick up notable support</a>&nbsp;in primary races, most recently capturing&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/nikki-haley-presidential-primary-election-indiana-8b73a23568e054ce33163e2ca23b8fb3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 21 percent</a>&nbsp;of votes in Indiana’s primary and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-presidential-primary-results-nikki-haley-20240424.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 17 percent in Pennsylvania</a>. Her steadfast voters could play a key role in determining the presidential election in November, yet there’s been little effort from the Trump campaign to pick up her supporters. For his part, Trump still hasn’t reached out to Haley since she left the race.</p>



<p>The jockeying for Trump’s No. 2 spot has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/trump-vice-president-candidates-00156496" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ramping up</a>&nbsp;in recent weeks, with vice presidential hopefuls — Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and New York Rep. Elise Stefanik — hitting the airwaves as they vie to be Trump’s running mate. The former president has also been weighing the contenders for Cabinet positions while watching closely to see how they perform with crowds during rally appearances.</p>



<p>In Charleston next week, Haley is set to meet with donors who supported her campaign as a “thank you.” Haley is not expected to endorse Trump, nor is she expected to ask her donors to support him.</p>



<p>Haley, when exiting the race, said it was up to Trump to win the support of moderate Republicans and independent voters who backed her across the country. The Biden campaign has continued to seize on Haley’s support as an example of Trump’s trouble in the suburbs and has tried to reel in these subsets of voters.</p>



<p>After Haley picked up support in Pennsylvania’s suburbs, the Biden campaign dropped a six-figure TV and digital ad buy across several counties,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/11/nikki-haley-voters-00157455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeting Haley voters</a>&nbsp;with an ad featuring Trump attacking his former U.N. ambassador and her supporters. Top campaign officials are also still working to recruit major Haley donors.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As Patriarch Kirill of Moscow grows increasingly radical, Orthodox priests and their congregations in Moldova and Estonia have starting severing ties with their Russian leadership.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Tiina Kaukvere</em><em> is an award-winning </em><em>Estonia</em><em>n journalist</em><em> currently </em><em>based</em><em> in Moldova.</em></p>



<p>An hour&#8217;s drive from Moldova&#8217;s capital city, in the village of Bozeini, Orthodox priest Tudor Roman lit three candles near the altar of a small countryside church. &#8220;I pray for forgiveness for Patriarch Kirill&#8217;s sins,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>For many Moldovan priests, it’s become clear that the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow — the overall leader of Moldova&#8217;s Orthodox Church — has veered onto the path of evil.</p>



<p>In Russia, religion has been used as a tool for justifying the war in Ukraine. And as many become convinced by the church that they’re part of God’s plan, and thus shouldn’t fear being killed while fighting for the “Russian world,” the cost has been tens of thousands of Ukrainian and Russian lives.</p>



<p>&#8220;You should not kill. The Orthodox Church cannot condone murder,&#8221; Roman asserted.</p>



<p>But Kirill has been growing increasingly extreme since the war began. In a recent statement, as outlined in an official document from the central church, he stated that <a href="https://linklock.titanhq.com/analyse?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.patriarchia.ru%2Fdb%2Ftext%2F6116189.html&amp;data=eJxNi0EKwyAUBU8TlxJTY5uFi25Cdz3Dj9ooKhrzjT1-XRYeMzDwlBR8HpWa9SYWzoiWOQWHTiVqKonyWC_xmeIr7e87OSV6qP4yxQx83CO4QFWKpMgA_qy9_Z-rtIh5uD2Hae1rrdEMWBwUZR3QUnvUWweaL3YJxgR7LNRiDD_lwjH0" target="_blank">Russia is waging a &#8220;Holy War&#8221; in Ukraine</a>, and that Ukrainian territory should be annexed by Russia.</p>



<p>Presently, the church&#8217;s position is that the “special military operation” in Ukraine is a holy war to protect the Russian world from the evil West. &#8220;Russia is the creator, pillar, and defender of the Russian World,&#8221; noted <a href="https://risu.ua/en/the-rocs-view-russian-world-extends-beyond-the-state-and-historical-borders_n147268" target="_blank">a document adopted at the end of March</a>.</p>



<p>But Russian Orthodox churches aren’t just found in Russia — they exist worldwide. And much like in Moldova, the church in Estonia is in moral turmoil — and there, the “Holy War” document is becoming the last straw.</p>



<p>Despite being one of the least religious countries in the world today, Orthodoxy remains Estonia’s biggest denomination, due to the country’s significant Russian population, comprising about 16 percent of the nation. The Russian church’s membership is over 100,000, while the Nevsky Cathedral — the main house of worship — is located just across the street from the Estonian Parliament in the heart of Tallinn.</p>



<p>However, authorities are now questioning whether the church in Estonia is acceptable. &#8220;The highest spiritual leader of their church has declared a holy war against the West, including Estonia. This amounts to incitement to terrorism — if a similar action were taken by an Islamic cleric, would we tolerate it? Certainly not,&#8221; said Estonia’s Minister of Interior Lauri Läänemets.</p>



<p>And he doubts Kirill will retreat from his stance. &#8220;On the contrary, they are becoming more aggressive over time, as the Russian people are mobilized behind Putin&#8217;s regime&#8217;s aggression, which requires justifying the aggression in Ukraine as serving a &#8216;higher purpose&#8217;,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is how an extremist group speaks, but not the leader of the church,&#8221; agreed Pavel Borşevschi, another Orthodox priest in Moldova.</p>



<p>Moldova is currently home to almost 1,000 Russian Orthodox churches, with over 90 percent of Moldovans identifying as Orthodox Christians. Indeed, Kirill is still formally the highest spiritual leader of Borşevschi’s St. Dumitru’s church in Chișinău — and yet, &#8220;Patriarch Kirill&#8217;s name is not mentioned in the church on workdays. People can no longer tolerate the Russian church, which has transformed into a sect,&#8221; Borşevschi said.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,height=683,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/12/GettyImages-1763670438.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4732461" style="aspect-ratio:1.499267935578331;width:790px;height:auto"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">n Russia, religion has been used as a tool for justifying the war in Ukraine. | Pool photo by Gavriil Grigorov via Sputnik/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>Then why, one might ask, is St. Dumitru’s Church still carrying on under Russian religious leadership, along with the entire Metropolis of Moldova?</p>



<p>&#8220;We must remain united regardless of everything. This is one of Christ&#8217;s teachings,&#8221; Borşevschi said. Instead, he hopes the Metropolitan of Moldova will spearhead a merger of the Moldovan Orthodox Church with the Romanian Orthodox Church.</p>



<p>Father Roman, however, has chosen not to wait. &#8220;When the war in Ukraine started, we said: That’s it!&#8221; he recounted. He rallied villagers to shift their allegiance from Russian religious leadership to the Romanian Patriarchate — a decision met with widespread agreement.</p>



<p>Since the outbreak of full-scale war in Ukraine, over 60 churches in Moldova have made the same transition. And according to Roman, many more long for the shift but are being pressured against it. &#8220;For example, they come from the Metropolis of Moldova with papers and announce that you no longer have the right to conduct services, or you are no longer the region&#8217;s priest,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Officially, the Moldovan Orthodox Church is still committed to remaining under the Russian patriarchate, though it does condemn Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Estonian Orthodox Church under the Moscow Patriarchate is also seeking to distance itself from Kirill&#8217;s pro-war statements. And earlier this year, the country’s security service deemed the leader of its Orthodox church, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/estonia-kick-out-russian-head-church-metropolitan-eugene/">Metropolitan Eugene Reshetnikov, a threat to Estonia’s security</a>, resulting in his residency visa not being extended.</p>



<p>Läänemets thus believes the church can no longer continue under Kirill&#8217;s leadership, and the state now plans to take legal steps to make that change.</p>



<p>For this, he outlines two options: Either the Orthodox churches in Estonia separate themselves from the Moscow Patriarchate — as churches in Moldova are currently doing — or the state intervenes for security reasons and terminates the activities of the Estonian Orthodox Church under the Moscow Patriarchate as an organization.</p>



<p>In Estonia&#8217;s neighboring country Latvia, for example, the local parliament approved a legislative amendment last year, <a href="https://cne.news/article/1750-latvia-persists-in-granting-independence-to-its-orthodox-church" target="_blank">declaring the Latvian Orthodox Church independent</a> of the authority of churches outside Latvia.</p>



<p>However, the fact remains that in the religious realm, such decisions aren’t made by politicians. And as it stands, the Estonian Orthodox Church wants to continue under the Russian Patriarchate despite its pro-war statements.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are not responsible for the patriarch’s words,&#8221; said the Estonian church’s Vicar Bishop Daniel of Tartu. He dismisses the &#8220;Holy War&#8221; document as irrelevant.</p>



<p>According to Daniel, Kirill’s just “making a mistake, like people do.” And in his mind, &#8220;shifting one&#8217;s church allegiance for every mistake isn’t the solution.”</p>



<p>However, there’s another option to consider.</p>



<p>In 2019, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/05/ukrainian-orthodox-church-breaks-away-from-russian-influence-.html" target="_blank">granted self-governance to the unified Orthodox Church of Ukraine</a>. And Speaker of Estonia’s Parliament Lauri Hussar sees this as a possible solution for the churches of Estonia — to come under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople.</p>



<p>“Ultimately, this issue will be resolved when Ukraine wins this war, prompting local Estonian churches to reconsider their affiliations,” he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[European Public Prosecutor's Office says budget move means it may no longer be able to focus on its investigative operations.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Top European prosecutors —&nbsp;who are <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/pfizergate-covid-vaccine-scandal-european-prosecutors-eu-commission/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/pfizergate-covid-vaccine-scandal-european-prosecutors-eu-commission/">investigating allegations</a> of criminal wrongdoing in connection with vaccine negotiations between Ursula von der Leyen and the CEO of Pfizer —&nbsp;are now threatening the European Commission with legal action.</p>



<p>On April 9, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/drug-kingpins-shift-stealing-eu-cash-europe-prosecutor-fight-back/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/drug-kingpins-shift-stealing-eu-cash-europe-prosecutor-fight-back/">Laura Codruța Kövesi</a>, who heads the European Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office (EPPO) — tasked with investigating serious financial crimes affecting the EU’s interests — took the unusual step of launching a so-called “amicable settlement procedure” with the Commission. This is the last legal step before litigation and if no agreement can be found, the fight could go&nbsp;as high as the EU’s General Court.</p>



<p>The prosecutors fear they will be unable to do their job properly if the Commission goes through with a plan to squeeze its budget — a move that was announced in February and came as a surprise, EPPO claims.</p>



<p><a href="https://api.politico.eu/editorial_documents/d6447735-8cac-4907-aed1-64ed773b4279" target="_blank">Kövesi’s letter</a> was shared in early April with three senior officials from the Commission, according to the document obtained by POLITICO. In it, the EPPO chief alleges that the Commission is depriving it of the means to carry out its work effectively by putting pressure on its budget, notably on the amount spent on IT.</p>



<p>When EPPO was launched in summer 2021, the Commission agreed to provide IT facilities with no end date given. The Commission has now told EPPO it wants to withdraw the IT support<strong>. </strong>The amount of money involved is around<strong> </strong>€5 million, according to <a href="https://www.eppo.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-02/2024.016_College_decision_seeking_additional_posts_and_resources_in_2024%20_mod2.pdf" target="_blank">EPPO’s estimates</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;The unilateral decision &#8230; to terminate, on 31 December 2024, the provision of the mentioned services to the EPPO risks that the Union’s independent prosecution office will be in the impossibility to carry out its tasks and achieve its mission,&#8221; Kövesi wrote, adding that &#8220;it is incumbent on the Commission to abstain from any measure that could jeopardize the attainment of the Treaty objective entrusted to EPPO in combating crimes affecting the financial interests of the Union.&#8221;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s potentially more at stake than a cut to the IT budget. A relatively new institution, EPPO is also a very important one as its prosecutors are empowered to lead cross-border investigations on something regularly denounced by the member states and the Commission as one of the biggest threats to the EU: criminal organizations going after the EU’s money.</p>



<p>In 2023, the number of EPPO investigations soared, the office wrote in its <a href="https://www.eppo.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-03/EPPO_Annual_Report_2023.pdf" target="_blank">annual report</a>. More than 200 fraud investigations were opened last year related to the EU-wide Recovery and Resilience Facility, which provides EU cash to help boost post-Covid economic recovery and is worth more than €800 billion. In 2022, when the disbursement of the EU cash was in its early phases, just 15 probes were launched.</p>



<p>Investigators from EPPO took over from Belgian prosecutors investigating von der Leyen over &#8220;interference in public functions, destruction of SMS, corruption and conflict of interest,&#8221; according to legal documents seen by POLITICO and a spokesperson from the Liège prosecutor&#8217;s office. While EPPO’s prosecutors are investigating alleged criminal offenses, no one has yet been charged in connection with the case.</p>



<p>The Commission, which was legally bound to answer within 15 days of EPPO’s letter, did send a response.</p>



<p>“The Commission has replied to EPPO within the designated period for an amicable settlement,” a spokesperson said. “In its reply, the Commission has expressed willingness to continue to support the IT services of EPPO for the foreseeable future under specific conditions. We cannot comment further.”</p>



<p>The Commission denied any attempt to interfere in EPPO’s independence and said in a statement that it “has been steadily supporting the EPPO&#8217;s activities from the very beginning and strongly rebuts any insinuation that the Commission decision in the budgetary procedure has any link with any investigation of the EPPO.”</p>

<p>It is unusual for an EU institution to threaten to sue the Commission, but tension had been building.</p>



<p>Through an open letter sent to MEPs and public remarks at the European Parliament, Kövesi has for weeks been asking the Commission to reevaluate its decision to cut a substantial part of the support it provides to the Luxembourg-based EPPO team, who have recently taken over a case looking into von der Leyen’s handling of Covid vaccine deals.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Pro-independence parties fall short of the 68 seats required to form a regional government in Catalonia for the first time in over a decade.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Pedro Sánchez&#8217;s Socialist Party won the biggest share of votes in Sunday&#8217;s regional election in Catalonia, in a result that boosted the Spanish prime minister and dealt a blow to the separatist movement.</p>



<p>Catalonia&#8217;s pro-separatist parties fell short of the combined 68 seats required to form a coalition government for the first time in over a decade, since before the push for independence known as &#8220;<em>el procés</em>&#8221; began.</p>



<p>Salvador Illa, leader of the Catalan wing of Sánchez’s Socialists, hailed the result as the start of a &#8220;new era&#8221; in the region and told supporters late Sunday that &#8220;it is my intention to become Catalonia’s next president.&#8221; But his party also fell short of a majority and will need to seek a deal with others in the chamber to form government.</p>



<p>The Socialists secured 42 out of 135 seats in the Catalan parliament, with almost all votes counted. The separatist Junts party of Carles Puigdemont, the man who as Catalan president in 2017 attempted to declare independence from Spain, came in second with 35 seats, while fellow separatists ERC won 20 seats, with others trailing further behind.</p>



<p>“The candidacy that I led had a good result, we are the only pro-independence force to increase in votes and seats, and we assume the responsibility that entails,” Puigdemont said as the election results came in. “But that is not enough to compensate the losses of the other separatists parties.”</p>



<p>The election leaves Puigdemont&#8217;s future uncertain. Before the ballot, he had pledged to leave active politics if he was not elected regional president, telling <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/catalonia-carles-puigdemont-spain-elections-independence-last-shot-at-pulling-it-off/">POLITICO</a> he had “a right to get some rest after these very difficult years.”</p>



<p>Catalan voters on Sunday also delivered a boost to the center-right People&#8217;s Party, which saw its share of seats jump to 15 from just three.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sergei Shoigu and Nikolai Patrushev have been among the most prominent figures in the Kremlin's war machine.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin announced he will replace the country&#8217;s top defense and security officials from their posts, as Moscow&#8217;s forces race to conquer territory across Ukraine before a new wave of Western weaponry arrives in Kyiv.</p>



<p>In a statement Sunday evening, Putin said he will remove Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who has overseen Russia&#8217;s armed forces since 2012. He will be replaced by Andrei Belousov, an economist with no military experience. Shoigu was appointed as secretary of Russia&#8217;s Security Council, a consultative body that advises Putin on military and strategic issues.</p>



<p>Intelligence chief Nikolai Patrushev was dismissed from that position despite being widely seen as one of Putin’s closest, and most hawkish, confidants.</p>



<p>Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov refused to elaborate on Patrushev’s fate, saying only&nbsp; that details would be announced in the coming days. His son, Dmitry Patrushev, has been promoted to deputy prime minister from agriculture minister&nbsp;as part of the same reshuffle.</p>



<p>The appointment of Belousov, a veteran economic adviser, to the top defense job is being interpreted as a sign that Putin is looking to switch gears, more than two years into the war against Ukraine and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-victory-day-vladimir-putin-war-ukraine-nazi-germany/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-victory-day-vladimir-putin-war-ukraine-nazi-germany/">just short of a year</a> after a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/yevgeny-prigozhin-wagner-troops-russia-ukraine-war-belarus/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/yevgeny-prigozhin-wagner-troops-russia-ukraine-war-belarus/">failed mutiny</a> by mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin.</p>



<p>&#8220;This move allows Putin to keep Shoigu on side, while bringing in someone who may be able to deal with the impact of corruption across the Russian Ministry of Defense,&#8221; said Philip Ingram, a former British military intelligence colonel and NATO planner.</p>



<p>“Whoever is more open to innovation is the one who is victorious on the battlefield,&#8221; Peskov told journalists, commenting on the logic behind Belousov’s appointment.</p>



<p>Other key Putin allies, including Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, have so far kept their roles in the reshuffle, which comes soon after Putin was  sworn in for an unprecedented fifth term.</p>



<p>In a speech from the gilded throne room in the Kremlin, Putin claimed his re-election was proof Russian citizens &#8220;have confirmed the correctness of the country’s course&#8221; and recognition that &#8220;we are facing serious challenges.&#8221; The nationwide ballot in March was marred by reports of widespread vote rigging, the banning of international observers and the fact that opposition politicians had been barred from standing, forced into exile or, in the case of anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, died behind bars just weeks before the election.</p>



<p>Commenting on Shoigu&#8217;s exit, British Defense Secretary Grant Shapps <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://x.com/grantshapps/status/1789741774547685487" target="_blank">wrote online</a> that the long-time official&#8217;s legacy was having &#8220;overseen over 355,000 casualties amongst his own soldiers and mass civilian suffering with an illegal campaign in Ukraine.&#8221;</p>



<p>Over the weekend, Russian forces launched a surprise attack across the border toward the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv — which had been liberated by Kyiv&#8217;s troops just six months after the start of the full-scale war. </p>



<p>A trickle of additional weaponry, ammunition and military hardware has begun reaching Ukraine&#8217;s military in recent weeks after the U.S. and the EU signed off on long-awaited aid packages that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said will be key to defending the country.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Right-wing VMRO party, which rejects a 2018 agreement not to call the country "Macedonia," won presidential and parliamentary elections last week.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>North Macedonia&#8217;s newly elected nationalist president hadn&#8217;t even been sworn in on Sunday before triggering a diplomatic spat with neighboring Greece.</p>



<p>During the swearing-in ceremony in the country’s parliament, Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, who is the young nation&#8217;s first female president, referred to her country as “Macedonia” rather than by its constitutional name, “North Macedonia.”</p>



<p>Greece’s ambassador to Skopje, Sophia Philippidou, immediately left the inauguration ceremony in protest.</p>



<p>In a statement, Greece&#8217;s Foreign Ministry said the new president’s words had violated the terms of the 2018 international <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/north-macedonia-enters-electoral-race-that-will-define-its-eu-path/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/north-macedonia-enters-electoral-race-that-will-define-its-eu-path/">Prespa Agreement</a> between Athens and Skopje, and had endangered both bilateral relations and North Macedonia’s prospects of joining the European Union.</p>



<p>Under the historic Prespa deal, the country’s name and constitution were changed, allowing North Macedonia to join NATO in 2020 and start its EU accession process.</p>



<p>“For North Macedonia to continue its successful path on EU accession, it is paramount that the country continues on the path of reforms and full respect for its binding agreements, including the Prespa Agreement,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen <a href="https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1789644015853298000" target="_blank">posted</a> on X.</p>



<p>Greece has blocked North Macedonia’s EU and NATO accession for decades, alleging that by calling itself “Macedonia,” its Balkan neighbor was appropriating a Greek name as well as the history of the ancient Greek Kingdom of Macedonia.</p>



<p>For the past two years, Bulgaria has also blocked North Macedonia’s EU bid, demanding its constitution be amended once again to acknowledge the country’s Bulgarian minority.</p>



<p>The Prespa Agreement was signed by the government at the time, led by the socialist SDSM party. By contrast the nationalist VMRO, to which Siljanovska-Davkova belongs, has always bucked the deal. During his campaign for last week&#8217;s parliamentary election, VMRO leader Hristijan Mickoski accused the SDSM of having made humiliating compromises to settle disputes with national neighbors, and continued to call the country “Macedonia” despite the Prespa accord.</p>



<p>“For me, Macedonia is and will remain Macedonia,” Mickoski repeated.</p>



<p>VMRO now returns to power after seven years, having secured <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/north-macedonias-conservatives-on-track-for-election-victory/">big wins</a> in parliamentary and presidential elections last week. Its results are expected to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/north-macedonia-enters-electoral-race-that-will-define-its-eu-path/">further complicate relations</a> with both Greece and Bulgaria, not to mention the country&#8217;s EU accession path. Although VMRO supports EU membership, it says it will not agree to the constitutional changes demanded by Bulgaria, a pre-condition for the country’s accession to the bloc.</p>



<p>In Greece, the left-wing Syriza opposition party condemned Siljanovska-Davkova&#8217;s use of the term Macedonia and called on the country&#8217;s government “to abandon this passive stance&#8221; and to mobilize &#8220;all available diplomatic means at international and European level&#8221; to address &#8220;with severity &#8230; any use of terms or actions by the new president and members of the new government of North Macedonia that violate the Prespa Agreement.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A report released Friday found that Israeli forces may have violated international humanitarian law, though it did not formally find that they had done so.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday continued to walk the fine line laid out in a long-awaited report released Friday about whether Israel has violated international humanitarian law.</p>



<p>The report, which Blinken submitted to Congress on Friday after a brief delay, found that Israeli forces have potentially violated international humanitarian law, though it&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israeli-forces-in-gaza-u-s-assessment-says/" target="_blank">did not formally find that they had done so</a>.</p>



<p>Blinken didn’t go any further when asked Sunday whether Israel has violated international humanitarian law.</p>



<p>“As you know, we put out a full report on that,” Blinken said, asked during an interview with Margaret Brennan on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”</p>



<p>“The report that we put out lays out some of the concerns that we’ve had throughout this period when it comes to humanitarian assistance, particularly the early months after October 7,” Blinken said. “And when it comes to the use of weapons, concerns about incidents, where given the totality of the damage has been done to children, women, men, it was reasonable to assess that, in certain instances, Israel acted in ways that are not consistent with international humanitarian law.”</p>



<p>But Blinken declined to say that the U.S. had concluded that Israel violated weapons-sharing agreements, saying that Hamas’ style of fighting “makes it very difficult to determine, particularly in the midst of war, exactly what happened, and to draw any final conclusions from any one incident.”</p>



<p>The U.S. does not plan to slow down any further weapons shipments to Israel, beyond the high-payload bombs that have been held up as Israel begins its incursion into Rafah, Blinken affirmed.</p>



<p>“What we’ve been clear about is that&nbsp;<em>if&nbsp;</em>Israel launches [its] major military operation into Rafah then there’s certain systems that we’re not going to be supporting and supplying for that operation,” he said.</p>



<p>“But at present, the only thing that we’ve delayed and are holding back are these high payload bombs, because we’re in an ongoing conversation with Israel, given the impact that those weapons can have when they’re used in densely populated areas.” Israel has&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2024/05/09/israel-has-gone-into-rafah-wheres-the-red-line-00157116" target="_blank">already entered Rafah, according to satelite images</a>.</p>



<p>Sen.&nbsp;Bernie Sanders&nbsp;(I-Vt.) said during an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday that while he has “a lot of respect” for Blinken, “the reality is, I think any objective observer knows Israel has broken international law, it has broken American law, and in my view Israel should not be receiving another nickel in U.S. military aid.”</p>



<p>Sanders has for months said that Israel’s actions in Gaza constitute a violation of international law.</p>



<p>The report released Friday, known as National Security Memorandum 20, drew backlash from some progressive members of Congress, who claimed it failed to serve as the mechanism for accountability it was meant to be.</p>



<p>“The [Biden] Administration created a tool to promote accountability but has come up very short in its implementation. When it comes to applying international law and human rights, you can’t cherry-pick the facts and the law,” Sen.&nbsp;Chris Van Hollen&nbsp;(D-Md.) said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-statement-on-administrations-nsm-20-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a statement</a>&nbsp;Friday, noting that the report “largely fails to meet the mark of what NSM-20 requires.”</p>



<p>House Foreign Affairs Chair&nbsp;Michael McCaul&nbsp;(R-Texas), however, said he was not surprised by the report’s findings and slammed the reporting requirement as politically motivated.</p>



<p>“NSM-20 serves no purpose other than to provide political cover to the president with his base. I am not surprised the administration concluded Israel is in compliance as this self-imposed reporting requirement is wholly redundant and unnecessary, and only contributes to politically-motivated anti-Israel sentiment,” McCaul&nbsp;<a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/mccaul-statement-on-nsm-20-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a statement</a>.</p>
