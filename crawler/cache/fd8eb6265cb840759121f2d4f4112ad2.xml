					<description><![CDATA[By calling for conquest, Xi has made an enemy of the Taiwan's tribes, which rightfully say their ancestors inhabited the island long before the dawn of the Chinese era.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Dr. Alexander Görlach is a senior fellow to the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs. He was a visiting scholar in Taiwan and Hong</em><em> Kong</em><em>, and writes extensively about this region of the world.</em></p>



<p>After <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/william-lai-takes-early-lead-in-taiwan-presidential-race-in-snub-to-beijing/">the election of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te</a> in January, political leaders from Beijing to Washington all asserted he’d lean toward what they called “Taiwan’s independence.” And for this presupposed tendency, the Chinese Communist Party and state-controlled media <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-calls-taiwan-president-frontrunner-destroyer-peace-2023-12-31/" target="_blank">labeled Lai a “destroyer of peace</a>,” vowing that the little island nation’s “reunification&#8221; with China was looming.</p>



<p>As a sort of preemptive measure, after Lai’s victory, U.S.-president <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-us-does-not-support-taiwan-independence-2024-01-13/" target="_blank">Joe Biden said that Washington wouldn’t support any sort of declaration of independence</a>, highlighting that his administration seeks to maintain the status quo between the two nations. Biden thereby reiterated the U.S.’s One-China Policy, which &#8220;acknowledges&#8221; Beijing&#8217;s assertion that Taiwan is a part of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) without agreeing to this claim.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contrary to Beijing claims and Washington warnings, however, Lai and his Democratic Progressive Party haven’t shown any inclination toward changing the status quo. Both Lai and outgoing president Tsai Ing-wen say that Taiwan — under the full name “Republic of China” (ROC) — is already an independent state going back to 1912, and thus doesn’t have to seek independence.</p>



<p>As a matter of fact, according to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-parliament-calls-taiwan-independent-country-report-says-james-cleverly-visit-china/">a report issued by the British parliament’s foreign committee last August</a>, Taiwan does, indeed, possess all necessary markers of statehood: a territory, a people, a functioning government and the ability to form foreign relations.</p>



<p>Many countries around the globe maintain quasi-diplomatic relations with the island, and their engagement with Taipei has only increased in the last couple years — not least because the world has grown aware of Beijing’s belligerence toward the island and its inhabitants. However, as it stands, Taiwan has only 12 real diplomatic partners left. And if it were to one day be left with no such partners, it would cease to exist as a state and Beijing could claim it.</p>



<p>Having said all this, however, there is, indeed, talk of independence in Taiwan — though not from the PRC but rather the ROC itself. And there’s an argument to be made that the island’s Indigenous tribes may well hold the key.</p>



<p>Taiwan became part of the ROC after World War II, when Japan had to surrender all its former colonies. But just two years later, another defeat loomed: The ROC’s nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek lost the civil war against Mao Zedong and retreated to Taiwan with his around 2 million followers. Not welcomed there, he erected a military dictatorship that subjugated the whole population, including the island’s 16 Indigenous tribes that had been living there for six millennia.</p>



<p>And today, thoughts of independence from Chiang’s ROC also come from within these Indigenous groups who never really considered themselves to be a part of China to begin with — whether in its imperial, nationalist or communist iterations.</p>



<p>“The only possibility for Taiwan to truly achieve independence from China’s grasp is, in theory, only to first allow the Indigenous tribes of Taiwan to establish an independent nation named ‘Formosa,’” said Chuan-ju Cheng, an associate professor of Indigenous studies at the Taipei University of Education, alluding to the name the Portuguese gave the island when they sailed past it. After that, “the Han people of Taiwan could join the new state,” added Cheng, who is herself a member of the Truku nation in the Hualien mountains to the island’s east.</p>



<p>Most of Taiwan’s Indigenous tribes still live in those mountains, which make up 60 percent of the island’s topography. Neither Dutch, Portuguese nor Spanish sailors and merchants ever conquered these heights or established full control over its people. The same goes for imperial China, which never controlled much more than outposts by the western shores. Only Japanese conquerers at the dawn of the 20th century succeeded in annexing or acquiring all the native land.</p>



<p>“Taiwan&#8217;s Indigenous people, particularly the highland groups, lost their land during the Japanese colonial period and have been unable to reclaim it from the hands of the Republic of China government up to this point,” Chen said.</p>



<p>According to legal scholars, any full reconciliation with Taipei would require some sort of restitution and self-governance — and on that path there has been progress.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,height=683,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/30/GettyImages-1929852073.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4519755"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te | Annabelle Chih/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>The tribes are recognized in today’s democratic Taiwan, their languages are taught in schools, and their cultures are fully supported by the government in Taipei. An increasing number of Taiwanese are also discovering their own Indigenous heritage through widely available DNA analysis — which might also help explain why <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/11/19/taiwan-china-indigenous-peoples-tribes/" target="_blank">more and more people are starting to see themselves as Taiwanese and not Chinese</a>. And among the Taiwanese, there’s a small yet vocal group that wants nothing to do with the once-oppressive ROC and to found an entirely new state.</p>



<p>In a democracy, it’s their full right to express this belief and advocate for it — sentiments that are alien to Beijing’s totalitarianism. Yet, it’s important to note that these views are from being mainstream.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Maintaining the status quo is preferable, no one wishes to change it,” Cheng said — and that’s because living in Taiwan’s democracy as it is now is better than the looming conquest by the dictator next door, who would most certainly reverse all the progress made.</p>



<p>By calling for conquest, Xi has made himself an enemy of Taiwan’s tribes, which rightfully say the island was inhabited by their ancestors long before the dawn of the Chinese era and, therefore, it’s for them to decide its future — not Beijing.</p>



<p>Moreover, Taipei could leverage this newly found union with the First Nations of Taiwan by highlighting their long-standing Indigenous heritage. These tribes reach six millennia back; they set off and <a href="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2022/08/analysis-new-research-sheds-more-light-on-link-between-m-ori-and-taiwan.html" target="_blank">settled the islands of Oceania and reached shores as far as New Zealand</a> — this can be proven by the languages spoken by the Indigenous peoples on all these islands. So, by actively seeking a role in the gatherings and conferences of these First Nations, Taipei can implicitly make a case for Taiwan’s statehood aside from the ROC’s recent past.</p>



<p>However, the relationship isn’t fully untethered. For example, for the Indigenous tribe of the Pingpu, it seems all but impossible to reclaim the land of their forebears, simply because the city of Tainan with its roughly 1.9 million inhabitants is now located there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, in the grand scheme of things, Taiwan’s successful democracy is a good example of how to atone for the wrongdoings and crimes of a colonial past. By contrast, under Xi, the PRC continues to repeat the atrocities of imperialism, building an empire by subjugating the people of Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Hong Kong; intimidating all of its neighbors in the region; and cracking down on local cultures within the PRC.</p>



<p>And if Xi has his way, the Indigenous people of Taiwan would be re subjugated once more, sharing the catastrophic fate of all other peoples forcefully drawn into Beijing’s orbit.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Israeli prime minister has until Monday to abide by a court ruling curtailing subsidies for ultra-Orthodox men.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing a coalition crisis and a Monday deadline over drafting ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military, as the war in Gaza rages on and deepens the country’s political conflicts.</p>



<p>After an Israeli Supreme Court ruling&nbsp;on Thursday curtailing subsidies for ultra-Orthodox men, Netanyahu&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-ultra-orthodox-war-netanyahu-gaza-1536d26e9a2720d19210f513697ff5ed" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/israel-ultra-orthodox-war-netanyahu-gaza-1536d26e9a2720d19210f513697ff5ed" target="_blank">has until Monday</a> to present a plan to dismantle what the court called a system that privileges the ultra-Orthodox at the expense of the secular Jewish public.</p>



<p>If that plan alienates the ultra-Orthodox lawmakers <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-asks-israeli-court-defer-deadline-conscription-controversy-2024-03-28/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-asks-israeli-court-defer-deadline-conscription-controversy-2024-03-28/" target="_blank">on whose support Netanyahu depends</a>, his coalition could weaken and the country could be forced to hold new elections.</p>



<p>The Supreme Court on Thursday <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-asks-israeli-court-defer-deadline-conscription-controversy-2024-03-28/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-asks-israeli-court-defer-deadline-conscription-controversy-2024-03-28/" target="_blank">ordered the suspension of state subsidies</a> for ultra-Orthodox Jews studying in yeshivas instead of doing military service. The ruling could have far-reaching consequences for Netanyahu&#8217;s government and for the tens of thousands of religious men who currently are exempt from mandatory military service.</p>



<p>The court ruling came just days ahead of an April 1 deadline for the Israeli government to agree on a new law to allow the ultra-Orthodox community to avoid being drafted, according to media reports. The government is debating a bill which reportedly seeks to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-29/netanyahu-coalition-in-crisis-over-religious-draft-as-war-rages?srnd=homepage-europe" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-29/netanyahu-coalition-in-crisis-over-religious-draft-as-war-rages?srnd=homepage-europe" target="_blank">strike a compromise</a> by allowing exemptions with limitations.</p>



<p>It is the most serious threat to Netanyahu&#8217;s government since he cobbled together a shaky national unity administration in the days after the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-rockets-airstrikes-tel-aviv-11fb98655c256d54ecb5329284fc37d2" target="_blank">Oct. 7 attack</a> by the Hamas militant group.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Moscow court charged Antonina Favorskaya with participating in the activities of late Kremlin critic Aleksei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Russian journalist Antonina Favorskaya was charged with extremism on Friday and remanded in custody for two months, according to media reports.</p>



<p>A Moscow court <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-charges-journalist-who-covered-navalny-trials/32883609.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-charges-journalist-who-covered-navalny-trials/32883609.html" target="_blank">formally charged</a> Favorskaya with participating in the activities of late opposition leader Alexei Navalny&#8217;s Anti-Corruption Foundation, which was labeled as extremist in 2021, according to <a href="https://news.sky.com/video/russia-journalist-who-covered-alexei-navalnys-trial-arrested-for-extremism-13104135" data-type="link" data-id="https://news.sky.com/video/russia-journalist-who-covered-alexei-navalnys-trial-arrested-for-extremism-13104135" target="_blank">the reports</a>. The journalist <a href="https://t.me/moscowcourts/2823" data-type="link" data-id="https://t.me/moscowcourts/2823" target="_blank">faces up to six years</a> in prison.</p>



<p>Favorskaya on Feb. 15 recorded <a href="https://news.sky.com/video/russia-journalist-who-covered-alexei-navalnys-trial-arrested-for-extremism-13104135" data-type="link" data-id="https://news.sky.com/video/russia-journalist-who-covered-alexei-navalnys-trial-arrested-for-extremism-13104135" target="_blank">the last video of Navalny</a> at a court hearing he was taking part in via video-link from an Arctic prison. The next day, Navalny suddenly died in the prison.</p>



<p>Favorskaya, a correspondent for independent broadcaster Sotavision, was<a href="https://t.me/sotavisionmedia/28588" target="_blank">&nbsp;detained</a>&nbsp;for a <a href="https://t.me/moscowcourts/2823" data-type="link" data-id="https://t.me/moscowcourts/2823" target="_blank">second time on Wednesday</a> after initially serving a 10-day administrative sentence in the Moscow region on charges of disobeying police orders, Sotavision said in a <a href="https://t.me/sotavisionmedia/28588" data-type="link" data-id="https://t.me/sotavisionmedia/28588" target="_blank">post on Telegram</a>.</p>



<p>She had also extensively covered Navalny&#8217;s funeral in Moscow before she was detained at a cafe on an anonymous tip, the <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/03/28/2-russian-journalists-detained-in-navalny-extremism-case-a84663" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/03/28/2-russian-journalists-detained-in-navalny-extremism-case-a84663" target="_blank">Moscow Times</a> reported. Colleagues of Favorskaya were also detained; the charges against those individuals remain unclear, the newspaper said.</p>



<p>Prosecutors say Favorskaya posted materials on social media that are <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/russian-court-orders-journalist-navalny-145512645.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/russian-court-orders-journalist-navalny-145512645.html" target="_blank">banned in Russia</a>, AFP reported. In court on Friday, she said the case was retribution for an article she wrote about how Navalny was &#8220;tortured&#8221; in prison, according to the report.</p>



<p>Navalny&#8217;s team has <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/russian-court-orders-journalist-navalny-145512645.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/russian-court-orders-journalist-navalny-145512645.html" target="_blank">condemned the case</a> and said the Russian regime was trying to create a &#8220;new wave of fear&#8221; among its critics.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ukrainian president also dismisses three advisers and two other officials.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed a longtime aide and several advisers on Saturday in a continuing reshuffle of the top ranks in Kyiv.</p>



<p>Zelenskyy dismissed top aide Serhiy Shefir from his post of first assistant, where he had served since 2019, according to a <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/documents/2072024-50289" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.president.gov.ua/documents/2072024-50289" target="_blank">brief statement</a> issued on Saturday. The Ukrainian president also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-reshuffle-143897f01e56fec1303c63766c0cc5f1" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-reshuffle-143897f01e56fec1303c63766c0cc5f1" target="_blank">let go three advisers</a>, as well as two presidential representatives overseeing volunteer activities and soldiers’ rights, according to <a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-president-dismisses-longtime-friend-105100732.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://au.news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-president-dismisses-longtime-friend-105100732.html" target="_blank">media reports</a>.</p>



<p>No explanation was given for the latest changes in a wide-reaching personnel shakeup over recent months. Saturday&#8217;s moves follow the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/zelenskyy-yanks-outspoken-security-council-boss-appoints-spy-chief-in-his-stead/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/zelenskyy-yanks-outspoken-security-council-boss-appoints-spy-chief-in-his-stead/">dismissal on Tuesday of Oleksii Danilov</a>, who served as secretary of the National Security and Defense Council. Danilov is being replaced by Oleksandr Lytvynenko, head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence service.</p>



<p>Last month, Zelenskyy removed Valerii Zaluzhnyi as head of the armed forces. He was appointed Ukraine’s&nbsp;ambassador to the United Kingdom&nbsp;earlier this month.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://t.me/s/kpszsu" data-type="link" data-id="https://t.me/s/kpszsu" target="_blank">Ukraine’s air force said</a> on Saturday that Russia launched 12 Shahed drones overnight, nine of which were shot down, and fired four missiles into eastern Ukraine. Russia has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-reshuffle-143897f01e56fec1303c63766c0cc5f1" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-reshuffle-143897f01e56fec1303c63766c0cc5f1" target="_blank">unleashed a barrage</a> of 38 missiles, 75 airstrikes and 98 attacks from multiple rocket launchers over the last 24 hours, Ukraine’s armed forces said in social media posts.</p>



<p>Ukrainian energy company Centrenergo announced on Saturday that the Zmiiv Thermal Power Plant, one of the largest thermal power plants in the eastern Kharkiv region, was destroyed following Russian shelling last week. Power outage schedules were still in place for around 120,000 people in the region, where 700,000 people had lost electricity after the plant was hit on March 22, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-reshuffle-143897f01e56fec1303c63766c0cc5f1" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-reshuffle-143897f01e56fec1303c63766c0cc5f1" target="_blank">Associated Press reported</a>.</p>



<p>Russia has escalated its&nbsp;attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure recently, causing significant damage in several regions. Officials in the Poltava region said Saturday there had been “several hits” to an infrastructure facility, without specifying whether it was an energy facility.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[By failing to publish a report on the nation's colonial history, Belgium signals it is not yet ready to shake off its past.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Belgium&#8217;s attempts to confront its brutal colonial past keep running into problems.</p>



<p>After two years of work by a parliamentary commission, a report was drawn up earlier this year, along with political recommendations on the next steps the country should take. But the full report, as well as its recommendations, has not been released to the public.</p>



<p>The point of contention? Apologizing to the former colonies, including the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Rwanda.</p>



<p>It comes against a backdrop of a looming national election, and attempts&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/decolonizing-cities-king-leopold-ii-black-lives-matter-belgium-colonial-history/" target="_blank">to foster</a>&nbsp;awareness of and contextualize — but not remove — the numerous colonial monuments still found all across Brussels and elsewhere.</p>



<p>In the latest example of this effort, the authorities this month unveiled an art installation that aims to contextualize the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_to_the_Belgian_Pioneers_in_Congo" target="_blank">colonial monument</a>&nbsp;in Brussels&#8217; Parc du Cinquantenaire glorifying Belgian colonizers who conquered Congo. The monument has frequently been a target of vandalism in recent years. Visitors to the park can now read the contextualization on panels in front of the monument and access additional information through a QR code.</p>



<p>Yet a formal apology for Belgium&#8217;s atrocities during the era of Leopold II remains a big no-no for the country.</p>



<p>The parliamentary commission came into existence in June 2020 in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests and was expected to come up with recommendations on how Belgium should best deal with the legacy of colonialism as well as racism and discrimination in the country. On the commission were MPs from across the political spectrum. </p>



<p>It was problematic from the get-go.</p>



<p>“Some of the members of the commission were not in favor of its existence … when it&#8217;s so political, it&#8217;s risky,” said historian Valérie Rosoux, who worked on the report.<strong> </strong></p>



<p>Belgium’s King Philippe broke the royal family&#8217;s silence on the subject in 2020 when he&nbsp;<a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/121931" data-type="link" data-id="https://pro.politico.eu/news/121931" target="_blank">expressed</a> “profound regret” for the wounds of the colonial past and the “acts of violence and cruelty&#8221; committed under Belgian occupation on the 60th anniversary of Congo’s independence.</p>



<p>Several years later, the notion of a formal apology remains just as contentious and ultimately was the reason why the commission failed.<br><br>&#8220;Why should all Belgians today apologize?&#8221; <a href="https://www.letemps.ch/monde/europe/belgique-echoue-presenter-excuses-passe-colonial" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.letemps.ch/monde/europe/belgique-echoue-presenter-excuses-passe-colonial" target="_blank">asked</a> Flemish liberal Maggie De Block in December 2022 when the commission finished its work.</p>



<p>Tensions flared up again earlier this year after the lawmakers in favor of an apology attempted to bring the publication of the report back onto the agenda.</p>



<p>But nothing has changed: MPs who sat on the commission from the French-speaking liberals (MR), the Flemish far right (Vlaams Belang), and the Flemish nationalists (N-VA) were opposed to the publication of the report.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A non-existent commission</strong></h3>



<p>“What happened was that the commission was dissolved after we failed to agree on recommendations.<em>&nbsp;</em>We cannot publish the report of a commission that does not exist anymore,” MR member of parliament Benoit Piedboeuf <a href="https://www.rtbf.be/article/commission-passe-colonial-deux-ans-de-travaux-pour-rien-11322110" target="_blank">told</a> Le Soir.</p>



<p>But according to historian Sarah Van Beurden, who participated in writing the preliminary report, the parliament is hiding behind a technicality. “If there is enough political will, they can find a way to make it happen,” she said, adding that not publishing the report represents “a deep political failure.”</p>



<p>&#8220;I almost don&#8217;t have words for it. I think it&#8217;s deeply politically irresponsible, but also sort of irresponsible on the human level … it’s deeply offensive on a human level to those who devoted their time to testimonies and hearings,&#8221; said Van Beurden.</p>



<p>Geneviève Kaninda, coordinator of Collectif Mémoire Coloniale et Lutte contre les Discriminations, a movement aiming to decolonize society, said publishing the report was a question of decency. “Colonization was a really horrible story,” she said. “It’s not about decolonization anymore, it’s about how a couple of political parties can hold a parliament hostage.”</p>



<p>Some 200 historians and several politicians have now signed a petition asking the parliament to <a href="https://www.lesoir.be/564645/article/2024-01-30/lappel-de-plus-de-200-personnalites-pour-la-publication-du-rapport" target="_blank">publish</a> the report. </p>



<p>“This was the first time that the parliament of the ancient colonial power was coping with its political past, which is a traumatic and dark past, the historical importance is quite obvious … the researchers all over the world should be able to consult the results,” said Wouter De Vriendt, a Green MP who chaired the commission.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A detailed report</h3>



<p>The almost 700-page report, shared with POLITICO, builds on testimonials from about 300 academics, diplomats and witnesses, as well as upon visits to former colonies. Parts of the report have been published on the parliament’s website, but the documents are not easy to find.</p>



<p>“I have no issue with publication of the report, what I am against is the publication of the political recommendations,” Thomas Roggeman, of the N-VA, told POLITICO, adding that the commission took a different turn over the years. “In the end, it was just about getting votes in the African communities, nothing to do with historical past.”</p>



<p>In 2022, those working on the report failed to find consensus on the notion of apologies to be made to the former colonies. Some claimed this would have led to financial reparations, even though one of the political recommendations states that the &#8220;recognition of Belgium&#8217;s role is sincere and necessary. It does not, however, imply any legal liability, and therefore cannot give rise to any financial reparation.”<br><br>Other recommendations — there are 128 in total — include the establishment of a Remembrance Day, the creation of a knowledge center, and facilitating easier visa procedures for scholars in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Rwanda.</p>



<p>“There were also practical things that could change the way in which the colonial past is represented in the public sphere, how the colonial collections are handled or change the way Congolese historians struggle to get visas to access archival collections in Belgium … and they just swept all of it off the table,” said Van Beurden.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>&#8216;Belgo-Belge issue</strong>&#8216;</h2>



<p>It’s not the first time Belgium has set up a commission aimed at dealing with its colonial past. One of the most notable was the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/lumumba-tooth-belgium-unfinished-reckoning-colonial-past/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/lumumba-tooth-belgium-unfinished-reckoning-colonial-past/">Lumumba Commission</a>, which concluded that &nbsp;Belgium was “morally responsible” for the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, the first democratically elected prime minister of Congo. <br><br>“It was a Belgian exercise. It’s what the Congolese like to call the Belgo-Belge issue,” said Van Beurden. “The Belgians are going to discuss this amongst themselves and then they’re going to make judgments about the colonial past that concern all of us. So there was skepticism from the beginning about the process.”<br><br>Nyanchama Okemwa, chair of the European Network Against Racism (ENAR), who has been living in Belgium for 30 years, was also dubious about the idea from the start.</p>



<p>“I was very sure it was not going to work, even when it started. Because how do you start when you have not yet even understood that your laws are obsolete? And that your policy is anchored upon obsolete ways of thinking,” she said.<br><br>According to Okemwa, the colonial mentality is embedded in Belgium and it will take many years to change that.</p>



<p>“Belgium is now very diverse, but this diversity is not reflected in the law,” she said, adding that compared to 30 years ago, the country has changed. </p>



<p>“I would not be doing this job for 30 years if I didn&#8217;t see certain changes. I&#8217;m very patient; the changes are slow, but they are happening. We cannot expect a problem of 500 years to change overnight.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The collective show of maritime force against China will be a centerpiece of next month’s trilateral summit in Washington.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S., Japan and the Philippines will launch joint naval patrols in the South China Sea later this year, according to a U.S. official and a foreign diplomat familiar with the planning. It’s a major move to counter China in the region — and one likely to elicit a strong response from Beijing.</p>



<p>The three-country naval maneuvers are part of a package of initiatives that President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will unveil at their first-ever trilateral summit next month, the official and the diplomat said.</p>



<p>The White House is also expected to announce that it will “seriously consider” having Japan as a technological partner in elements of the “AUKUS” security partnership between the U.S., U.K. and Australia, according to a Defense Department official and another person familiar with the planning, both granted anonymity to speak ahead of an announcement.</p>



<p>The April 11 trilateral summit is seen as key to cementing efforts by the three countries to counter China’s regional influence. White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/18/statement-from-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-on-the-upcoming-trilateral-leaders-summit-of-the-philippines-japan-and-the-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a statement last week</a>&nbsp;that the three leaders will discuss ways to “further peace and security in the Indo-Pacific,” but did not provide further details.</p>



<p>The South China Sea has become increasingly tense in recent years as China has used its military might to lay claim to waters&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uscc.gov/research/south-china-sea-arbitration-ruling-what-happened-and-whats-next" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internationally recognized as belonging to the Philippines</a>&nbsp;— establishing bases and harassing Philippine Coast Guard units. There are rising concerns in Washington that Beijing and Manila could tip into open conflict. Beijing could also use those military outposts to support a blockade or invasion of Taiwan in coming years.</p>



<p>The joint naval patrols will mark the most robust assertion of the Biden administration’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017e-f997-d39c-abfe-ff9794c60000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indo-Pacific Strategy</a>&nbsp;hinged to rallying allies and partners to offset China’s growing economic, diplomatic and military footprint in the region.</p>



<p>While the U.S. and the Philippines have conducted joint patrols previously, this will be the first time Japan’s navy has joined with them in doing so — a show of force designed to show Beijing its belligerence won’t be tolerated. Japan’s involvement also reflects the Kishida government’s moves to make Tokyo a bigger player in regional security alongside the U.S. that began with his announcement in 2022 of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mod.go.jp/en/publ/w_paper/wp2022/DOJ2022_Digest_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubling of the country’s defense budget</a>&nbsp;within five years.</p>



<p>The National Security Council, DOD and the Japanese embassy in Washington declined to comment. The Philippine embassy didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>The joint operations also raise the risk of possible confrontations with Chinese forces operating in the region. Beijing has already&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-philippines-blinken-marcos-south-china-sea-0c39aa94e32469f3d608561c2c0f167c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ignored repeated warnings</a>&nbsp;from the Biden administration that the U.S.-Philippine Mutual Defense Treaty obligates the U.S. to intervene if Philippine forces come under armed attack.</p>



<p>In recent months, Chinese vessels have on multiple occasions&nbsp;<a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-coast-guard-hits-philippine-boat-with-water-cannons-crew-hurt/7539925.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deployed water cannons</a>&nbsp;against Philippine Coast Guard vessels, injuring Filipino sailors.</p>



<p>Chinese forces “will continue to take resolute steps to safeguard its territorial interests,” China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/202403/t20240325_11270550.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lin Jian said Monday</a>. Marcos warned on Thursday that his government would respond with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/28/philippiness-marcos-promises-measures-after-chinas-dangerous-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a “countermeasure package”</a>&nbsp;aimed to deter “aggressive and dangerous attacks” by China in the South China Sea.</p>



<p>It is not clear how soon the Japan-U.S.-Philippines patrols will start. The three militaries have been laying the groundwork for joint patrols already — they began holding&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/1/us-philippines-japan-set-to-hold-first-ever-joint-naval-drills" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joint maritime training exercises</a>&nbsp;in the region in June.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The Crocus City complex in northwest Moscow was once a gleaming beacon of President Vladimir Putin’s promise of comfort and stability.</p>



<p>A glitzy shopping and entertainment complex built by billionaire Aras Agalarov, it was the venue for Donald Trump to host his Miss Universe contest in 2013.</p>



<p>Today, the concert hall’s charred skeleton is a smoldering testament to foreign-inspired extremism and willful, home-bred ignorance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russia’s worst terror attack in two decades caught Putin halfway through the post-election victory lap of his life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Days before, he had been cheered by a flag-waving crowd on Red Square and received a&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/RIAKremlinpool/12543" target="_blank">standing ovation</a>&nbsp;from an elite group of public figures in the Kremlin’s opulent St. Andrew’s Hall.</p>



<p>His message to the different groups was one and the same: that Russia was fighting a historic war against Ukraine and that in order to win (as no doubt it would) total unity was paramount.</p>



<p>So was an understanding of the enemy; in a speech to Russia&#8217;s Federal Security Service (FSB), Putin dismissed a U.S. warning about an imminent terror attack as “outright blackmail and an intention to intimidate and destabilize our society,” telling his spooks to hone in on finding “traitors.”</p>



<p>It took nineteen hours after gunmen descended on Crocus, killing at least 140 people, for Putin to give a televised address. By then the Islamic State group had claimed the attack as its own, providing gruesome first-hand footage as evidence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Putin, however, did not name the group. He spoke in general terms of “international terrorism.&#8221; He said four suspects had been caught trying to flee to Ukraine, compared them to “Nazis” and vowed revenge against those “guiding them.”</p>



<p>“Our common duty now, comrades-in-arms at the front, all citizens of this country, is to stand together in single formation,” he said.</p>



<p>In a different galaxy, the heinous attack could have served as the ultimate wake-up call for Russia and jolted it out of its current destructive orbit.</p>



<p>But all the evidence suggests that Putin will instead shape the narrative of the atrocity to suit his own plans as the first autocrat-in-chief in modern Russian history.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tampering</h3>



<p>Since Putin’s ascent to power a quarter century ago, every election has been deemed less free and fair than the one before it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this March vote,&nbsp;<a href="https://golosinfo.org/articles/146794" target="_blank">denounced</a>&nbsp;by the independent election monitor Golos as pure “imitation,” was a qualitative leap in Russia’s creeping journey towards autocracy.</p>



<p>Months ahead of the event, various independent media had already&nbsp;<a href="https://meduza.io/feature/2023/07/18/v-kremle-reshili-chto-na-vyborah-2024-goda-putin-dolzhen-nabrat-bolshe-80" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;that the presidential administration had instructed regional officials to ensure Putin would get around 80 percent of the vote.</p>



<p>That number would trump his last result in 2018, and buttress his claim that a large majority of Russians support his full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>In light of disparate but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russian-election-alexei-navalnys-final-plan-to-cause-vladimir-putin-maximum-damage/">persistent</a>&nbsp;protests in recent months, it would also have stretched credibility to breaking point.</p>



<p>But instead of those protests acting as a natural brake on tampering —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/burial-from-the-grave-alexei-navalny-takes-a-last-jab-at-putin-russia/">thousands of Russians</a> taking to the streets despite military censorship hardly communicates consensus — Putin’s state apparatus appears to have went for the jugular, handing him 87 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/29/GettyImages-2105323901-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4519095" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/29/GettyImages-2105323901.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/29/GettyImages-2105323901.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">It took nineteen hours after gunmen descended on Crocus, killing at least 140 people, for Vladimir Putin to give a televised address. | Olga Maltseva/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>That result, coming a month after the sudden death of Putin’s number one foe, Alexei Navalny, does not just communicate the absence of any significant opposition, as appeared to have been the initial goal.</p>



<p>It communicates the absence of any opposition at all.</p>



<p>As the pro-Kremlin tabloid&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mk.ru/politics/2024/03/17/rossiya-eto-putin-politicheskie-posledstviya-87-prezidenta.html" target="_blank">Moskovsky Komsomоlets</a>’ front-page headline summarized for those readers who did not instinctively grasp the dogma behind the number: “Russia is Putin.”</p>



<p>“It has now been recognized and officially proven that there can be no opposition (or even the hint of it) to the president,” the article went on to say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also marks a definitive break with an era during which the Kremlin strove to maintain a carefully curated facade of democracy over a blatant display of Putin’s power.</p>



<p>For Temur Umarov “it feels like home,” he told POLITICO in a phone conversation from Tashkent, Uzbekistan.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/29/GettyImages-2008718478-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4519119" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/29/GettyImages-2008718478.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/29/GettyImages-2008718478.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The election result came a month after the sudden death of Vladimir Putin’s number one foe, Alexei Navalny. | AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>On Telegram, the Central Asia expert and fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/TemurUm/109" target="_blank">compared</a>&nbsp;Putin’s landslide result with those of autocratic leaders in various ex-Soviet countries.</p>



<p>Putin&#8217;s margin of victory ranked somewhere behind those belonging to the leaders of Azerbaijan (92.12) and Tajikistan (90.92), but was ahead of Belarus&#8217; Alexander Lukashenko (80.20).</p>



<p>Umarov said that Putin today most reminds him of Uzbekistan strongman Islam Karimov (90.39 percent in 2015) who clung onto power for almost three decades by centralizing all control and ruthlessly repressing dissent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it also resulted in him suffering “delusional beliefs” about the state of affairs in his country, as underlings feared sharing any information that could be seen as negative, Umarov said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He added that although there are clear parallels between the autocracies in Central Asian countries and Russia today, there is also an important difference.</p>



<p>Speaking several days before the Crocus terror attack, he said that “these countries didn’t declare such sky-high results after an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/wagner-group-russia-forces-turn-back-moscow-prigozhin-declares/">attempted coup</a>, a hugely popular opposition leader&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/alexei-navalny-dead-russia-prison/">dying&nbsp;</a>in prison,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/alexei-navalny-funeral-detentions-vladimir-putin-arch-rival-burial/">people coming out in protest</a>, or a war that put the country under strain.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Rather than a reflection of real consolidation, it feels as if Putin is trying to overcompensate for the destabilized situation in his country,&#8221; Umarov said.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Not ISIS</h3>



<p>Two days after the attack, a more confident Putin appeared on television once again. This time he spoke of “radical Islamists” who had acted on the instruction of the “neo-Nazi Kyiv regime.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By then, his propagandists had already found culprits in Ukraine, Britain and the United States, who had&nbsp;apparently&nbsp;used the radical islamists to cover their tracks.</p>



<p>“Deep down the collective West always despised us and felt a hatred bordering on a death wish,” prominent TV personality Tina Kandelaki wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A commentator on Russian state TV described the attack as bearing the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8TdHrU88qg" target="_blank">signature</a>&nbsp;of European nazism.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another columnist accused “foreign agents,” a term used to stigmatize&nbsp;Kremlin-critical Russians, of being behind the incident.</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="717" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/24/GettyImages-925926734-1-1024x717.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4167885" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/24/GettyImages-925926734-1.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/24/GettyImages-925926734-1.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Opponents of the Kremlin or those with alternate lifestyles have been branded as terrorists and extremists. | Mladen Antonov/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>That fits within a trend which has seen opponents of the Kremlin or those with alternate lifestyles be branded as terrorists and extremists; a conflation of terms that, many now argue, might have facilitated the Crocus attack by distracting the security services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The same people who are meant to monitor potential terrorists have also been dealing with cases of people who have been accused of justifying terrorism for defending Ukraine, or&nbsp;persecuting&nbsp;who belong to certain&nbsp;religious minorities,” Alexander Verkhovsky of the Research SOVA center&nbsp;for extremism told POLITICO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s only so much capacity,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The blame game has been accompanied by an undisguised thirst for revenge. Footage of the suspected gunmen showing them being tortured by what appeared to be vigilantes has been broadly circulated by top Kremlin media figures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the suspects was filmed having his ear cut off and then having it forced into his mouth. A blogger then put the blooded knife up for auction. Another suspect appeared to be missing an eye and was brought into court barely conscious in a wheelchair.</p>



<p>All of it seems designed to distract from any public discussion of real accountability&nbsp;for the failures that appear to have contributed to the atrocity and its scope&nbsp;— including intelligence missteps, a slow police response and locked doors that meant concertgoers could not escape.</p>



<p>Тhe drive to control the narrative goes far. In some places local authorities have<a href="https://t.me/horizontal_russia/35108" target="_blank">&nbsp;instructed</a>&nbsp;civil servants to lay flowers and visit makeshift memorial sites, just as they ordered them to vote&nbsp;еаrlier this month,&nbsp;despite the large (and spontaneous) outpouring of solidarity across the country presumably rendering that unnecessary.</p>



<p>But&nbsp;the attack exposes Putin, whose promise since launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has been one of maintaining normalcy. Instead of addressing Russia’s real vulnerabilities, his state apparatus is even more motivated&nbsp;than before&nbsp;to demonstrate its total control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ordinary Russians, not to mention the country’s neighbors, will pay the price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Putin’s supporters do not seem mournful at leaving democracy behind. “I support fair elections whenever they are relevant,” 22-year-old Sofia Nekrasova, who voted for Putin, told POLITICO. </p>



<p>“But at a time when we are fighting against Western arms and mercenaries, we as a country don’t need democracy.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Biden administration has some two dozen proposals to reform a much-reviled institution it hopes will run postwar Gaza.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. is near a deal with the Palestinian Authority to end its contentious “martyr payments” for people who commit acts of violence against Israel, two Biden administration officials said.</p>



<p>That would be a key win for the multifaceted U.S. push to reform the PA — from instituting anti-corruption measures to improving basic services — so that it can take over governance of the Gaza Strip whenever the Israel-Hamas war ends.</p>



<p>The PA oversees parts of the West Bank, and it is seen by the Biden administration as the best option for governing Gaza in the future. But the PA is reviled by many Palestinians, as well as Israelis and Arab leaders, who see it as corrupt, inefficient and out of touch.<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://eb2.3lift.com/pass?tl_clickthrough=true&amp;redir=https%3A%2F%2Frtb-us-east.linkedin.com%2Flax%2Fclk%3Ftrk%3DCwEAAAGOi0eLlL1Nahm2WOdHEeVb7C84728IbdT8qKRt6AcK4wnKvUbX2QFwV5GpWaeHgvX4UeacwYAAizDOUGIjwOYaGpWtXnwlbSEUx2VKtgZvhELN7KueHjbCe2_8E0b5_T1wyGj-6uTPbtdPuZnW5DPdTWlpzuYXjEoqkWRx0ju9lo2TI9ZcQJ-3CHdcOLj2dnKSmQrI7ASG0M-WLUevCrohGSRNm3POtRMLaTTm9IR9bDzBVTZR89qkRDpCNiwtSwIkUfMn3OscfrKzKSekHwTiI6Yza1L_KFiqtkl8nVB7r56y0Ht3TvMVFRwTPjg6_6lB5THOKbcD-zS6RknhNCp_qDJgVaodS_h72Ga4bGa2q4EIOLF-rYfdmLWpL0FoPa3xI1yQ5ibdp3lcmQhSV5Dw6vPffxS5UK7QkJ8i8ndOGftXsXMKMb9Wya_c5vEyqFR9iSAkSv5gzUrKeA7qq3U6bYPfB1_BLsMw4z_C3-DT-FO5mwWYlzLz20yaSkXTpaWnZ8E6FvCgiOggbVI5EaB6-oLypeW8ISE42zxO9kIRNWb15mCpq1nKfKyEKHDl90m1LlGMm8GbKtfDSaEg9Ky_b5-UcCqtQf4sMwz4WR3x6hsVm454yvo1CJPgRPTDWIBGrIrSkkbeVYkYsFGQIDlt1NfC_JG2miPMukCuQUxU_cXkb-FwpOC7OC1SjHotFwcVbstNI91iULfY8SdYbE72CXmrc6NKd7P9ZleMV93riCvznMm1dZk5Ov3Jj7D3xgtHIvcx8ZIP6JQ1iw1f0FElQYzor0VKUzT7QthAEHHd777nRwZJF8O2-IKM8j7ZSJBSzLWUI-u3kG3P-jaJrzFc1FnfaC9ptumT9x9PpqDw4O7tp3YxLvJwDnA2TKioa4j-lJdKg5yJIQZQcdC4YCLGTvEn5DsI9Wpvw5M6icCgnYS2TwNHyezo9AboaUzxiwE6BKhLjzZcyKx5pJH7ZS-xPeEqXFyMUzy25GPp7BwhPc27dWIUEr6lFgwfJbSt96kAd1WEe7VjehwDyLq_0YWfH5tScD33hJ4x--Z9GzOm1oindASMLSxa2GfQEhYFkWbp1exlpJdwrKN-9_2uP9EqsnEE9BS07vUa0VWvFamSyXa8d8JskutVgmrYo7sK3Ka1yWCR-BoYhCUtnn0xlNACylYHIh2ZjIkmK_vRilvJ3m4cKcLN6kPtLtoM-5vyg4IBUCoLYvMqtxB2i_E57n3IUmTJv3Y4rDXGNGl5dlB1JojqR0ztWZMf30l3Pg1Ddcbm5dbZeaPtGrTBVl3NMkjNRI5l48OzU7MzHNbu89uvyGH6NYQgdwlDBfhgiHP0ir8P2XLVMkUfp3B28CjAFf_HeapO_-ssO0Nmv1cTw7OqY0Lf39U5sxcxhTVeqKHZAJnl_jzHOSJNHEykd9CeIH_8WQ2pdfiyIIl7WOMBD6XWCxxaXdsd-m5CyM0L1tbB88r1Z9x2bnY-63Y5mlLRbbHJ7ILPOgPnOKOc2Gb3kKWWwm8cNpvZnnQbZnh9aQpdqSGT9sKm1-yDnG0wDk87ifOfKl8QR1RhWpCU9vrkCrDDzjotxO0YMfC8HljdFRR36XUsti1rA7q8gUBn7-q3MDkD-No1_TiB7Sqsri_G6glsT3xNPaHxDLs%26action%3Dclick%26laxrid%3D29a24ba8-cf81-461d-b6d2-17f22a0224cb%26laxbid%3D2%26eid%3D3%26crtype%3Dvid%26laxerid%3D3823221105984736853101-289%26adfmt%3D6%26wp%3D%24%7BTL_AUCTION_PRICE%7D%26urle%3DCwEAAAGOi0eLmQ63fzmVuZ94-xrn4vN1F2tg1f01WYfKMedRpRItX3Qg6xc4wN-ppws_aQxc_jYokKyEgXTqBQokjlD0R6qLOg6zrVlv3n3uZqGOg-XOCGPrcs_2ou6gfzldvOI99fIlJIuF3Q%26urlhash%3D87j6&amp;pr=0.413&amp;bc=1.049&amp;aid=38232211059847368531011&amp;bmid=6250&amp;biid=7777&amp;sid=66552&amp;brid=556676&amp;adid=382733584&amp;crid=232100109&amp;ts=1711733705&amp;bcud=1049&amp;ss=12&amp;cb=14763" target="_blank"></a></p>



<p>The “martyr payments” program&nbsp;<a href="https://israelpolicyforum.org/2021/04/02/palestinian-prisoner-and-martyr-payments-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financially supports Palestinians and their families if they are wounded, imprisoned or killed while carrying out acts of violence</a>&nbsp;against Israel. It has long infuriated Israelis who say it incentivizes terrorism and call it “pay for slay.” Many Palestinians say it provides crucial support for people standing up to an oppressive Israeli occupation.</p>



<p>Drafts of the PA payments reform plans seen by U.S. officials indicate that Palestinian leaders will replace the current scheme with a general welfare program. Further specifics were not immediately available.</p>



<p>“There’s been a great deal of work on this behind the scenes, and the progress is encouraging,” a senior Biden administration official said. Another administration official confirmed changes to the system were expected soon. That said, as with all things involving Israel and the Palestinians, new roadblocks could emerge.</p>



<p>The officials, and others in this story, were granted anonymity to discuss sensitive topics candidly.</p>



<p>The White House and the State Department declined to comment. A spokesperson for the PA did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>The push for specific reforms has been complicated by the question of whether the leadership of the Palestinian Authority is willing or capable of making changes. The PA’s overall leader, 88-year-old President Mahmoud Abbas, seems unwilling to exit the scene and has not held elections in nearly two decades, frustrating many Palestinians.</p>



<p>But Abbas is taking some steps that have encouraged U.S. negotiators. He recently tapped a new prime minister, Mohammad Mustafa, partly in response to U.S. demands for fresh leadership.</p>



<p>On Thursday, Abbas unveiled a new Cabinet. Most of the incoming names are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/pas-abbas-announces-new-cabinet-with-little-known-figures-taking-key-roles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">little-known figures</a>, though some are believed to have ties to Gaza.</p>



<p>The broader U.S. reform plan for the PA consists of roughly two dozen proposals, according to a person familiar with the issue.</p>



<p>Some are long-standing requests, such as creating a new anti-corruption mechanism. Others are more mundane but still important, such as changes to how retirees are paid and ways to save money on their health care referral system. The U.S. also intends to help train Palestinian security forces to operate in Gaza as part of a longer-term stabilization effort.</p>



<p>Two U.S. officials familiar with the Middle East file confirmed the existence of the broader plan and some of the details. The plan is not static, nor is it a diktat to the Palestinians, the person familiar with the issue said. In many ways, its proposals are the result of years of thinking and conversations.</p>



<p>Although in the immediate aftermath of the war, which broke out on Oct. 7, Abbas dismissed the notion of PA rule in Gaza, he appears more open to the idea now. The PA previously governed in Gaza until being pushed out by Hamas militants in 2007.</p>



<p>Still, some of Abbas’ decisions so far aren’t bold enough for some American officials.</p>



<p>The new prime minister, Mustafa, is U.S.-educated, has worked at the World Bank and is considered a technocrat. But he’s also seen as close to Abbas, and&nbsp;<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/01/palestine-abbas-mohammed-mustfafa-resignation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there are questions about his role in past alleged PA corruption</a>.</p>



<p>Some members of the Biden administration, particularly in the State Department, expressed reservations about the choice, as did some former U.S. officials.</p>



<p>“Mohammad Mustafa is not someone who sends a message of reform,” said Dennis Ross, a former U.S. diplomat who spent years negotiating various Middle East peace deals.</p>



<p>But others at State, as well as top Middle East hands at the White House National Security Council, said it wasn’t worth having a dust-up with Abbas over Mustafa. They also argued that the U.S. should avoid looking as if it is imposing a leader on the Palestinians.</p>



<p>“We do think Mustafa is a serious technocrat. He’s not ideal, but he can be a big upgrade” over the prime minister who recently resigned, Mohammad Shtayyeh, one of the U.S. officials familiar with the Middle East file said.</p>



<p>U.S. leverage over the PA is limited, not least because America’s financial support for the institution is far less than it once was.</p>



<p>But the war in Gaza has damaged the West Bank’s economy, partly because Israel has tried to curb the PA’s access to funds, and that added weakness may be making the PA more open to Washington’s ideas.</p>



<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes a PA role in Gaza, despite U.S. insistence that there’s no other institution that could take on the job if Israel doesn’t want to occupy the densely populated territory.</p>



<p>Netanyahu has often said the PA is little different from Hamas, and that it fosters hate against Israelis. But Netanyahu’s own political future is cloudy given Israeli fury over the security failure that allowed Hamas militants to attack Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting around 240 others.</p>



<p>Another factor Abbas, Mustafa and others in the PA are weighing is the support of Arab states. Many Arab leaders agree with ordinary Palestinians that the PA doesn’t represent the desires of the people it supposedly serves and is poorly run.</p>



<p>“The powers that be in the region can’t see themselves engaging in a serious way absent Palestinian Authority reform,” a third U.S. official familiar with Middle East issues said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After years of discussions, the British Army has lifted its more than 100-year-old ban on beards, it said in a statement obtained by POLITICO.</p>



<p>The change comes after the army conducted a months-long review of its policy on personal appearance, which had previously only allowed for a mustache. King Charles III, British politicians and allies of the United Kingdom were all consulted in the decision, Sgt. Maj. Paul Carney said in a video sent to troops and made available to the media.</p>



<p>“There was an overwhelming majority who felt that the army ought to change its policy and allow soldiers to wear beards,” Carney said. “We&#8217;ve listened and we&#8217;ve taken action.”</p>



<p>Officers and soldiers will be allowed to grow beards — but they must maintain a professional appearance and adhere to specific guidance on what their beards can look like, Carney said. The policy went into effect on Friday to allow those on Easter vacation to immediately start growing out their facial hair. </p>



<p>Those going unshaven should expect to have their appearance reviewed to ensure that beards are in line with army regulations. On occasion, beards will still have to come off if the operational situation demands it.</p>



<p>Grant Shapps, who is U.K. secretary of defense, is among the proponents of the new measure. He told <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/army-ends-beard-ban-by-royal-command-c6836nwrl" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/army-ends-beard-ban-by-royal-command-c6836nwrl" target="_blank">the Times</a> last year that banning beards in the army was “ridiculous” and called on the institution to “modernize.”</p>



<p>With the change, Britain joins the armies of  Denmark, Germany and Belgium, which already allow their troops to grow beards, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68691987" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68691987" target="_blank">BBC reported</a>. </p>
