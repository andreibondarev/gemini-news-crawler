					<description><![CDATA[A report released Friday found that Israeli forces may have violated international humanitarian law, though it did not formally find that they had done so.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday continued to walk the fine line laid out in a long-awaited report released Friday about whether Israel has violated international humanitarian law.</p>



<p>The report, which Blinken submitted to Congress on Friday after a brief delay, found that Israeli forces have potentially violated international humanitarian law, though it&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israeli-forces-in-gaza-u-s-assessment-says/" target="_blank">did not formally find that they had done so</a>.</p>



<p>Blinken didn’t go any further when asked Sunday whether Israel has violated international humanitarian law.</p>



<p>“As you know, we put out a full report on that,” Blinken said, asked during an interview with Margaret Brennan on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”</p>



<p>“The report that we put out lays out some of the concerns that we’ve had throughout this period when it comes to humanitarian assistance, particularly the early months after October 7,” Blinken said. “And when it comes to the use of weapons, concerns about incidents, where given the totality of the damage has been done to children, women, men, it was reasonable to assess that, in certain instances, Israel acted in ways that are not consistent with international humanitarian law.”</p>



<p>But Blinken declined to say that the U.S. had concluded that Israel violated weapons-sharing agreements, saying that Hamas’ style of fighting “makes it very difficult to determine, particularly in the midst of war, exactly what happened, and to draw any final conclusions from any one incident.”</p>



<p>The U.S. does not plan to slow down any further weapons shipments to Israel, beyond the high-payload bombs that have been held up as Israel begins its incursion into Rafah, Blinken affirmed.</p>



<p>“What we’ve been clear about is that&nbsp;<em>if&nbsp;</em>Israel launches [its] major military operation into Rafah then there’s certain systems that we’re not going to be supporting and supplying for that operation,” he said.</p>



<p>“But at present, the only thing that we’ve delayed and are holding back are these high payload bombs, because we’re in an ongoing conversation with Israel, given the impact that those weapons can have when they’re used in densely populated areas.” Israel has&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2024/05/09/israel-has-gone-into-rafah-wheres-the-red-line-00157116" target="_blank">already entered Rafah, according to satelite images</a>.</p>



<p>Sen.&nbsp;Bernie Sanders&nbsp;(I-Vt.) said during an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday that while he has “a lot of respect” for Blinken, “the reality is, I think any objective observer knows Israel has broken international law, it has broken American law, and in my view Israel should not be receiving another nickel in U.S. military aid.”</p>



<p>Sanders has for months said that Israel’s actions in Gaza constitute a violation of international law.</p>



<p>The report released Friday, known as National Security Memorandum 20, drew backlash from some progressive members of Congress, who claimed it failed to serve as the mechanism for accountability it was meant to be.</p>



<p>“The [Biden] Administration created a tool to promote accountability but has come up very short in its implementation. When it comes to applying international law and human rights, you can’t cherry-pick the facts and the law,” Sen.&nbsp;Chris Van Hollen&nbsp;(D-Md.) said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-statement-on-administrations-nsm-20-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a statement</a>&nbsp;Friday, noting that the report “largely fails to meet the mark of what NSM-20 requires.”</p>



<p>House Foreign Affairs Chair&nbsp;Michael McCaul&nbsp;(R-Texas), however, said he was not surprised by the report’s findings and slammed the reporting requirement as politically motivated.</p>



<p>“NSM-20 serves no purpose other than to provide political cover to the president with his base. I am not surprised the administration concluded Israel is in compliance as this self-imposed reporting requirement is wholly redundant and unnecessary, and only contributes to politically-motivated anti-Israel sentiment,” McCaul&nbsp;<a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/mccaul-statement-on-nsm-20-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a statement</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[U.N. chief Guterres renews demands for an immediate cease-fire, unconditional release of all hostages, and a surge in humanitarian aid.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Israeli forces are reported to be attacking across the Gaza Strip on Sunday, intensifying bombardments in the Jabalia refugee camp&nbsp;in the north of the enclave while increasing pressure on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. </p>



<p>Israeli tanks entered the Jabalia camp, which holds more than 100,000 people, on Sunday following heavy overnight bombardments of the area, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-pushes-back-into-northern-gaza-ups-military-pressure-rafah-2024-05-12/" target="_blank">Reuters report</a>. The Israeli army said its aim is to eliminate &#8220;attempts by Hamas to rehabilitate its military capabilities in Jabalia.&#8221; </p>



<p>Israel has also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-05-11-2024-7cc8784d8c6eec017ecaef696f492b25" target="_blank">ordered</a> new evacuations in the city of Rafah, bordering Egypt — which is sheltering about 1.4 million people — as it prepares to expand Israeli military operations there.</p>



<p>The United Nations has <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/highlight/2024-05-10.html" target="_blank">warned</a> against a full-scale ground attack on Rafah, saying it would lead to an &#8220;epic humanitarian disaster&#8221; and would undermine attempts to support refugees amid a looming famine. U.S. President Joe Biden has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/us-biden-warns-red-line-israel-rafah-cyprus-aid-ship-gets-ready-open-humanitarian-sea-corridor-gaza/">called</a> an Israeli ground offensive against Rafah a &#8220;red line,&#8221; <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/rafah-israel-hamas-war-benjamin-netanyahu-joe-biden-us/">warning</a> that the U.S. would withhold weapons shipments if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&nbsp;goes ahead with the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-evacuation-order-rafah-jabalia-hamas-war/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-evacuation-order-rafah-jabalia-hamas-war/">prospective attack</a>. </p>



<p>On Sunday, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres used a video <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2024-05-12/un-secretary-generals-video-message-the-9th-conference-effective-partnership-for-better-humanitarian-aid" target="_blank">address</a> to a Kuwait humanitarian conference to urge, again, for &#8220;an immediate humanitarian cease-fire, the unconditional release of all hostages, and an immediate surge in humanitarian aid.&#8221;</p>



<p>A cease-fire &#8220;will only be the start. It will be a long road back from the devastation and trauma of this war,&#8221; Guterres said.</p>



<p>An Israeli offensive in Rafah doesn&#8217;t have the support of the U.K. government either, Foreign Secretary David Cameron  <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1789582592729108875" target="_blank">said</a> on Sunday. </p>



<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t believe they should go in for a major operation in Rafah unless they have a plan to move people out of the way and to make sure they have shelter and food and medicine,&#8221; Cameron <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68998654" target="_blank">told the BBC</a>. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t seen that plan, so we don&#8217;t support a major operation in Rafah,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>But Cameron pushed back against calls to halt arms deliveries to Israel. &#8220;Just to simply announce today: We&#8217;re going to change our whole approach to arms exports rather than go through our careful process — it would strengthen Hamas, it would make a hostage deal less likely, I don&#8217;t think it would be the right approach,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>A cease-fire <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/biden-in-seattle-cease-fire-possible-tomorrow-if-hamas-frees-hostages/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/biden-in-seattle-cease-fire-possible-tomorrow-if-hamas-frees-hostages/" target="_blank">could be possible “tomorrow”</a> if Hamas releases hostages, Biden said on Saturday  at a private fundraiser in Seattle. “Israel said it’s up to Hamas,” Biden said. “If they wanted to do it, we could end tomorrow.”</p>



<p>More than <a href="https://twitter.com/gazanotice/status/1789619617255858578" data-type="link" data-id="https://twitter.com/gazanotice/status/1789619617255858578" target="_blank">35,000 Palestinians have been killed</a> and almost 79,000 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, the Gaza health ministry said on Sunday.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the U.K. government is investigating Hamas claims that a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68998654" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68998654" target="_blank">British-Israeli hostage</a>, Nadav Popplewell, has died. Hamas abducted the 51-year-old Popplewell from Kibbutz Nirim along with his mother during the militant group&#8217;s Oct. 7 attack on Israel. On Saturday, Hamas <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-release-video-fate-israeli-hostage-nadav-popplewell-2024-05-11/" target="_blank">said</a> he had died from wounds sustained in an Israeli airstrike more than a month ago, hours after circulating a video of Popplewell.</p>



<p>Cameron said he had seen the video, but added that &#8220;we don&#8217;t want to say anything until we have better information.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[He’s still under threat of jailtime if he violates a gag order.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After spending the week sitting in silence as a parade of witnesses — from porn star Stormy Daniels to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/10/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/westerhout-undercuts-prosecution-00157292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>a former White House aide</u></a>&nbsp;— testified in court, Donald Trump had to get a lot off his chest.</p>



<p>Speaking before tens of thousands of people in Wildwood, New Jersey, Trump called the hush money case a “sham.” He mocked Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg as “Fat Alvin.” He insulted the judge overseeing the case as “corrupt” and “highly conflicted.” And according to Trump, Joe Biden was to blame for it all.</p>



<p>“As you know, I’ve come here from New York, where I’m being forced to endure a Biden show trial — all done by Biden,” Trump said.</p>



<p>Trump’s tirade came after a pivotal week in his New York criminal trial, where Daniels’ eye-popping testimony resulted in an excruciating few days for the former president. And Monday is set to be another big day at the courthouse, when Trump’s former fixer Michael Cohen is expected to take the stand.</p>



<p>But Trump on Saturday avoided mentioning the witnesses or jurors in the case, likely aware that any public attack would violate the gag order imposed by Justice Juan Merchan. While Merchan already held Trump in contempt for violating the order 10 times and fined him a total of $10,000, the judge also threatened Trump last week with jail time for future violations.</p>



<p>Surrounded by roller coasters and amusement park thrills along a boardwalk in Wildwood, the former president railed against the trial that has largely taken him off the campaign trail. This was only the third rally Trump has held since the case began almost one month ago.</p>



<p>But in recent events, Trump has been escalating his attacks on the justice system and Biden. During&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/05/trump-retreat-biden-2024-elections-00156171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>a private donor retreat last week</u></a>&nbsp;in Palm Beach, Trump accused Biden of “running a Gestapo administration.” And on Saturday, he said the president is “surrounded by fascists around the Oval Office.”</p>



<p>“All of this persecution is only happening because I’m running for president. If I wasn’t leading in the polls by a lot and running for president, they wouldn’t be after me. I’d have a nice place. I’d be down in Palm Beach. I’d be traveling the world,” Trump said, before repeating falsehoods about the 2020 election that he lost to Biden.</p>



<p>During the speech, Trump threw well-worn lines on the border, windmills and electric vehicles, China and migrants. And he compared himself to the infamous gangster Al Capone, which has become a regular bit on the campaign trail.</p>



<p>“Al Capone was so mean that if you went to dinner with him and he didn’t like you, you’d be dead the next morning. And I got indicted more than him. On bullshit, too. Just bullshit,” Trump said. The crowd erupted into cheers of “bullshit.”</p>



<p>While Trump hit many familiar targets in his speech — like criticizing countries for not contributing more to NATO — he also attacked Biden over his pledge to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/08/biden-says-u-s-will-cut-off-offensive-weapons-to-israel-if-they-go-into-rafah-00156943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>withhold weapons from Israel</u></a>&nbsp;if it launches any assaults on the highly populated city of Rafah. Other Republicans have also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-threat-withhold-weapons-from-israel-shows-he-favors-hamas-victory-republicans-argue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>strongly criticized</u></a>&nbsp;Biden’s warning to Israel and accused him of emboldening Hamas.</p>



<p>“He has truly set the world on fire,” Trump said. “This week, he announced that he will withhold shipping weapons to Israel as they fight to eradicate Hamas terrorists in Gaza. That was shocking to hear it, even as there are still American hostages being held by Hamas.”</p>



<p>And Trump vowed to deport any foreign student who brings “jihadism or antisemitism” to U.S. college campuses, saying that America’s biggest enemies are “from within.”</p>



<p>“The enemies from within are more dangerous to me than the enemies on the outside. Russia and China we can handle, but these lunatics within our government that are going to destroy our country, we have to get it stopped,” Trump said. “They’re not on the right, they’re on the left.”</p>



<p>Trump was met with a massive crowd of supporters in Wildwood, who waited in lawn chairs outside the event for days, according to local media. One local official told the Associated Press that&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-new-jersey-president-trial-gag-order-59a8073e5a22f7a1e13f1461e9998419" target="_blank">there were approximately 80,000 people in attendance</a>. The crowd cheered as the former president flew over the rally site and the beachside amusement park on his Trump-branded private plane.</p>



<p>North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a former presidential challenger-turned top surrogate and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/09/doug-burgum-trump-vice-president-00156922" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>vice presidential contender</u></a>, and Christian Craighead, a former British Special Air Service operative and hero in the 2019 Nairobi terrorist attack, introduced Trump.</p>



<p>“Who are we going to send back to the White House — Trump!” Burgum said.</p>



<p>While the court proceedings have put a damper on Trump’s campaigning, he has held campaign events in Michigan and Wisconsin as well as fundraisers and campaign events at his private club in Florida.</p>



<p>Trump lost the historically Democratic state of New Jersey to Joe Biden in 2020 by 16 points, but the rally was held in an area that has leaned Republican. Cape May County, where Wildwood is located, voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020.</p>



<p>It’s also an area that attracts residents — and media attention — from the battleground state of Pennsylvania and it is a quick trip from New York, where Trump has been spending four days a week inside a chilly courtroom over charges he falsified business records to cover up an alleged affair with Daniels ahead of the 2016 election.</p>



<p>Trump was visibly frustrated with Daniels’ testimony last week in court, where she described in embarrassing detail their alleged sexual encounter. Next week, Cohen — Trump’s former attorney and closest aide turned public antagonist — will be taking the stand to discuss his involvement in making the hush money payment to Daniels and orchestrating her payouts. In 2018 Cohen was charged with campaign finance violations, tax fraud and bank fraud, and was sentenced to three years in prison.</p>



<p>While Trump was stumping on the East Coast, Biden was making his pitch to donors on the West Coast with fundraising stops in San Francisco and Seattle on Friday and Saturday.</p>



<p>Ahead of Trump’s rally, Biden’s campaign and surrogates knocked his visit to New Jersey and his team’s recent assertion that they believe states like Minnesota and Virginia are in play. They also took a jab at Trump’s plans to campaign in New York.</p>



<p>“They’re talking about holding concerts in Madison Square Garden to turn out voters in states like New York and here, on planet Earth, in the Biden campaign, we’re going to remain laser focused on the pathway to 270 electoral votes,” Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler told reporters on Friday.</p>



<p>“We’re focused on communicating directly with the voters who are actually going to decide this presidential election,” he continued. “So, no matter where the Trump team decides they want to spend their time, the fact of the matter is, as I said at the top of this call, they do not have the infrastructure to reach the voters who are going to decide this election.”</p>



<p>Trump on Saturday also went after some of New Jersey’s most famous residents, including Bruce Springsteen and former Gov. Chris Christie. Trump claimed he attracted a bigger crowd than Springsteen, and invited the crowd to boo Christie, a former Trump ally turned critic.</p>



<p>“Does anybody like Chris Christie?” Trump said, before calling Christie “unhinged” and suffering from a major case of Trump derangement syndrome.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Song competition was marked by protests over Israel's participation and the Dutch entrant's disqualification.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Swiss singer Nemo won the Eurovision Song Contest late Saturday in a competition marked by controversy over the presence of Israel and the disqualification of the Dutch entrant.</p>



<p>The competition in Malmö, Sweden, was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c03drw23zewo" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c03drw23zewo" target="_blank">overshadowed by protests</a> over Israel&#8217;s participation in the contest amid the ongoing <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-evacuation-order-rafah-jabalia-hamas-war/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-evacuation-order-rafah-jabalia-hamas-war/">Israeli military campaign</a> in the Gaza Strip.</p>



<p>Nemo triumphed with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eurovision-song-contest-final-israel-protests-09e31963ed7db607ea137c9333eabf87" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/eurovision-song-contest-final-israel-protests-09e31963ed7db607ea137c9333eabf87" target="_blank">“The Code,” a pop-rap ode</a> to the singer’s journey toward embracing a non-gender identity. Croatia, which led the public vote, came in second with &#8220;Rim Tim Tagi Dim.&#8221; Israel&#8217;s entrant, Eden Golan, came fifth after receiving a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/sweden-gears-up-eurovision-final-amid-israel-protests-dutch-controversy-2024-05-11/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/sweden-gears-up-eurovision-final-amid-israel-protests-dutch-controversy-2024-05-11/" target="_blank">mixture of boos and cheers</a> as she performed on stage in Malmö.</p>



<p>Switzerland’s Nemo beat Croatian singer Baby Lasagna to the title by winning the most points from a combination of national juries and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/in-the-safe-hands-of-sweden-here-comes-eurovision-2024/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/in-the-safe-hands-of-sweden-here-comes-eurovision-2024/">viewers around the world</a>.</p>



<p>“I hope this contest can live up to its promise and continue <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eurovision-song-contest-final-israel-protests-09e31963ed7db607ea137c9333eabf87" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/eurovision-song-contest-final-israel-protests-09e31963ed7db607ea137c9333eabf87" target="_blank">to stand for peace and dignity</a> for every person,” Nemo said after the result was announced. Nemo expressed pride in accepting the trophy for “people that are <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c03drw23zewo" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c03drw23zewo" target="_blank">daring to be themselves</a> and people that need to be heard and need to be understood.”</p>



<p>Joost Klein, the Dutch entrant in the song contest, was <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eurovision-dutch-kicked-out-final-police-threats-woman/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/eurovision-dutch-kicked-out-final-police-threats-woman/">banned from Saturday night&#8217;s final</a> following a formal complaint by a female member of the production crew, the event’s organizer, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), said in&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://eurovision.tv/mediacentre/release/statement-dutch-participation-eurovision-song-contest" target="_blank">a statement</a>&nbsp;on Saturday. </p>



<p>The decision followed an investigation by Swedish police into the woman’s complaint.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Italy&#8217;s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who leads the right-wing Brothers of Italy party, will face Italian opposition leader Elly Schlein in a televised debate on May 23 ahead of the European Parliament election. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/giorgia-meloni-european-election-2024-italy-prime-minister/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/giorgia-meloni-european-election-2024-italy-prime-minister/">long-awaited confrontation</a> is set to take place on the television show &#8220;Porta a Porta&#8221; hosted by&nbsp;Bruno Vespa on Rai1, Italian media <a href="https://www.theitaliantimes.it/2024/05/11/meloni-schlein-confronto-tv-rai-1-porta-porta-quando-dove/" target="_blank">reported</a> on Saturday. The candidates are expected to discuss key policy areas including employment, health and migration. </p>



<p>Schlein, secretary of the center-left Democratic Party, has been vocal against Meloni for her politics, including her proposal to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/melonis-dangerous-constitutional-change-in-italy/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/melonis-dangerous-constitutional-change-in-italy/">change the Italian constitution</a> to allow citizens to directly vote for the prime minister, which Schlein describes as a &#8220;a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/eu-election-debate/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/eu-election-debate/">botched and dangerous reform</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meloni <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/179200" target="_blank">announced</a> she would be running in the European elections last month, with the ambition to create a majority that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0JYqstzOiI&amp;t=1s" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0JYqstzOiI&amp;t=1s" target="_blank">&#8220;brings together the center-right forces&#8221;</a> and to &#8220;send the left <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-epp-ursula-von-der-leyen-conservatives-european-election/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-epp-ursula-von-der-leyen-conservatives-european-election/">into the opposition</a> even in the EU,&#8221; she said at a party event in Pescara, Italy.</p>



<p>Her party already&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.adnkronos.com/politica/europee-sondaggio-fratelli-ditalia-si-conferma-primo-partito-con-il-27-2-pd-sale-al-20-3_1XYCZrNqXqvbi4uM4v28bB" target="_blank">tops recent polls</a>&nbsp;in Italy, and is predicted to get 27.2 percent of the vote, ahead of the Democratic Party (20.3 percent) and the Five Stars Movement (16.8 percent).</p>



<p>The Brothers of Italy party is part of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, which <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/von-der-leyen-hard-right-maastricht-debate-giorgia-meloni-viktor-orban-schmit/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/von-der-leyen-hard-right-maastricht-debate-giorgia-meloni-viktor-orban-schmit/">could become part of a coalition</a> with the European People&#8217;s Party (EPP) as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/179270" target="_blank">hinted</a> during the Maastricht debate late last month. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk says the country faces a "hybrid war" in illegal migration.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Poland will strengthen its eastern border infrastructure to deter migrants entering from Belarus, as the number of illegal crossing attempts increases. </p>



<p>Tusk said that Poland is facing a &#8220;hybrid war&#8221; in illegal migration from Belarus, as he visited the village fo Karakule on the border to meet with troops, according to the <a href="https://www.pap.pl/en/news/poland-faces-escalating-hybrid-war-tusk-says-poland-belarus-border" target="_blank">Polish Press Agency</a>. &#8220;There will be no limit of funds when it comes to the the security of Poland,&#8221; he said. </p>



<p>The prime minister reaffirmed his belief that Alexander Lukashenko&#8217;s regime in Belarus is &#8220;co-organizing this practice&#8221; as the country has been demonstrating increasingly aggressive intentions towards Poland. In 2021, Poland accused Belarus of letting in thousands of <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/british-troops-deployed-to-help-poland-guard-its-border-with-belarus/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/british-troops-deployed-to-help-poland-guard-its-border-with-belarus/">undocumented migrants</a> through the border into the European Union, accusations that Belarus denies. </p>



<p>Tusk on Saturday said the bolstered fortifications would be along the &#8220;entire eastern border,&#8221; which could also include Ukraine and Russia. He gave no details on the planning.</p>



<p>Belarus has also come under fire recently for its customs union with Russia. On Monday, the European Commission called for sweeping trade sanctions against Belarus, saying that concerns over food security should not be used as an argument to give Moscow’s closest ally any exceptions, <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/179546" target="_blank">according to a proposal seen by POLITICO</a>.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, a high-level Polish judge <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-judge-asks-for-asylum-in-belarus-protest-against-unjust-policy-towards-russia/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-judge-asks-for-asylum-in-belarus-protest-against-unjust-policy-towards-russia/">sought political asylum</a> in Belarus, saying the move was in “protest against Poland’s unjust and harmful policy” toward Belarus and Russia.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The decision follows a police investigation into a formal complaint by a female member of the production crew. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> Joost Klein, the Dutch candidate in the Eurovision song contest, has been banned from the competition&#8217;s final taking place tonight in Malmö, Sweden, following a formal complaint by a female member of the production crew.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The Dutch artist Joost Klein will not be competing in the Grand Final of this year’s Eurovision Song Contest,&#8221; the event’s organizer, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), said in <a href="https://eurovision.tv/mediacentre/release/statement-dutch-participation-eurovision-song-contest" target="_blank">a statement</a> Saturday. The decision follows an investigation by Swedish police into the woman&#8217;s complaint, which was made &#8220;after an incident following his performance in Thursday night’s Semi Final,&#8221; according to the statement.</p>



<p>&#8220;While the legal process takes its course, it would not be appropriate for him to continue in the contest,&#8221; the EBU said.</p>



<p>The case has now been passed to a prosecutor, the Swedish press <a href="http://According to information to Swedish broadcaster SVT, a physical confrontation has occurred between the Dutch artist Joost Klein and a photographer." target="_blank">reported</a>. The complaint accuses Klein of making threats, according to the reports. Further details were unavailable. </p>



<p>Reports of a possible &#8220;incident&#8221; concerning <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/dutch-eurosong-entry-turns-political-timmermans-links-eu-successes/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/dutch-eurosong-entry-turns-political-timmermans-links-eu-successes/">the singer</a> circulated on Friday after Klein was unexpectedly banned from taking his turn during the second dress rehearsal, even though he attended the traditional &#8220;flag parade&#8221; at the beginning of the competition. </p>



<p>Confusion over the matter prompted the EBU  to issue a statement on Friday saying that it was &#8220;currently investigating an incident &#8230; involving the Dutch artist.&#8221;</p>



<p>A spokesperson from the Swedish police confirmed that a man is suspected of unlawful threats at Malmö Arena on Thursday evening, <a href="https://www.svt.se/kultur/incident-utreds-kring-nederlandske-artisten-joost-klein" target="_blank">according to Swedish media outlet SVT Nyheter</a>. </p>



<p>Speculation that the investigation had something to do with the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-eurovision-song-contest-hamas-war-finland-sweden/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-eurovision-song-contest-hamas-war-finland-sweden/">Israeli participant Eden Golan</a> grew after a tense exchange between the two performers during a Eurovision press conference on Thursday evening.  </p>



<p>Asked if her participation in the song contest presented a security risk to others in the show given that her presence, song and recent qualification for the semi-final had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/may/09/israel-qualifies-eurovision-song-contest-final-protests" target="_blank">sparked fierce protests</a> in Malmö, a representative of the EBU told Golan she didn&#8217;t have to answer but Klein shouted back asking &#8220;Why not?&#8221; </p>



<p>In its statement on Saturday, the EBU said that &#8220;<a href="https://eurovision.tv/mediacentre/release/statement-dutch-participation-eurovision-song-contest" data-type="link" data-id="https://eurovision.tv/mediacentre/release/statement-dutch-participation-eurovision-song-contest" target="_blank">contrary to some media reports</a> and social media speculation, this incident did not involve any other performer or delegation member.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to the Eurovision <a href="https://eurovisionworld.com/esc/the-netherlands-joost-klein-not-rehearsing-until-further-notice" target="_blank">website</a>, the &#8220;Rest of the World&#8221; vote — which allows people in non-participating countries to vote — has been postponed until the &#8220;ongoing investigation regarding the Dutch participant has been concluded.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Israel&#8217;s Golan earlier <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/defying-haters-israels-eden-golan-advances-to-the-eurovision-grand-final-on-saturday/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.timesofisrael.com/defying-haters-israels-eden-golan-advances-to-the-eurovision-grand-final-on-saturday/" target="_blank">qualified for the Eurovision final</a> hours after thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in the streets of Malmö to show their support for Gaza.

					<description><![CDATA[The Israeli army plans to "work with great force" against Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces said. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Israel Defense Forces told people in parts of Rafah and in the city of Jabalia to leave &#8220;immediately&#8221; Saturday morning, as Israel prepares to expand its military operation in the Gaza Strip. </p>



<p>The Israeli army plans to &#8220;work with great force&#8221; against the Hamas militant group,  Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Avichai Adraee said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1789171670105636971" data-type="link" data-id="https://twitter.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1789171670105636971" target="_blank">post on X</a>, calling the areas to be evacuated a &#8220;dangerous combat zone.&#8221;</p>



<p>The evacuation order covers the southeastern part of Rafah along the Israeli border and the Egyptian border — including <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/08/israel-rafah-scott-anderson-unrwa-00156924" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/08/israel-rafah-scott-anderson-unrwa-00156924" target="_blank">the Rafah crossing</a>, which the Israeli military blocked on Tuesday. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1789224467165503733" data-type="link" data-id="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1789224467165503733" target="_blank">IDF statement</a>, Hamas has been &#8220;trying to rebuild its capabilities in the region.&#8221;</p>



<p>People were told to go to a humanitarian zone in Al-Mawasi in the western part of the Gaza Strip, where more than 400,000 people have sought refuge, according to the <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-106-situation-gaza-strip-and-west-bank-including-east-Jerusalem" target="_blank">latest situation report</a> from the U.N.&#8217;s Palestinian humanitarian agency UNRWA. </p>



<p>But the humanitarian camp cannot house any more people, the agency said, as about 80,000 people have already fled Rafah and moved to the area since the Israeli army issued its first evacuation order on Monday. </p>



<p>The evacuation orders come as a much-anticipated U.S. State Department report on the Israel-Hamas conflict stopped short of declaring that Israel has violated international law in its war with the militant group. </p>



<p>“It is reasonable to assess” that Israel used U.S.-provided weapons in ways that are “inconsistent” with international law, the report states. But Israel didn’t give Washington enough evidence to adjudicate whether those arms were used to violate human rights in Gaza, the West Bank or East Jerusalem, according to the document.</p>



<p>On Friday, the U.N. General Assembly voted to grant new <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/10/un-assembly-palestine-membership-resolution-00157391" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/10/un-assembly-palestine-membership-resolution-00157391" target="_blank">“rights and privileges” to Palestine</a> and called on the Security Council to reconsider Palestine’s request to become the 194th member of the U.N. The 193-member world body approved the resolution by a vote of 143-9 with 25 abstentions. The United States voted against the resolution, along with Israel, Argentina, Czechia, Hungary, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Papua New Guinea.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s the first time crypto has become an issue in the general election of a presidential race.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Donald Trump is making presidential history all over again: He’s poised to be the first major party nominee to court cryptocurrency traders. It’s leaving some Democrats feeling uneasy.</p>



<p>Trump told crypto backers at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday that they “better vote” for him because of the way the Biden administration has unleashed a regulatory crackdown on the industry.</p>



<p>“They are against it,” he said at an event promoting his own non-fungible token, or NFT.</p>



<p>Trump’s overt play for the crypto faithful is a big shift from the criticism he dished out in his first term, but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/08/donald-trump-crypto-savior-00132417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s not unexpected</a>. The GOP has become increasingly friendly toward bitcoin and other digital assets in recent years, while key Democrats remain at odds over whether to grant the industry legitimacy after a series of scandals. Trump’s direct embrace is a landmark moment for crypto firms that have undertaken an intense Washington lobbying effort and are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/18/crypto-firms-investors-78m-super-pacs-00132199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spending tens of millions of dollars</a>&nbsp;to influence the 2024 elections.</p>



<p>“President Trump’s remarks signal a sea change in the importance of digital assets this election cycle,” said Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, a top crypto industry lobbying group.</p>



<p>The issue is giving Trump a fresh line of attack on Biden. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, a Biden nominee, has pursued an extensive series of enforcement actions against crypto firms that he says are flouting federal securities laws. The White House on Wednesday angered crypto advocates when it threatened to veto bipartisan&nbsp;House legislation&nbsp;that would undo SEC guidelines the industry hates.</p>



<p>“Gensler is very much against it,” Trump said Wednesday of the administration’s approach to crypto. “The Democrats are very much against it.”</p>



<p>Not all Democrats are against it. Twenty-one Democrats on Wednesday defied Biden’s veto threat and joined with Republicans in voting for a resolution&nbsp;to overturn SEC crypto guidance. Trump’s embrace could add a new partisan tinge to the debate over crypto regulation — a risk for the industry, which is courting both sides.</p>



<p>Following Trump’s comments, Rep.&nbsp;Wiley Nickel, a pro-crypto North Carolina Democrat,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/wileynickel/status/1788608778843074658?s=46" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>&nbsp;that his party “cannot hand this issue to the Republicans.” But key Democrats like Sen.&nbsp;Elizabeth Warren&nbsp;(D-Mass.) have stood in the way of industry-friendly policies while warning of risks to consumers and the financial system, as well as crypto’s role in financial crime.</p>



<p>It’s unclear, though, whether courting digital asset traders can win a significant number of votes. A Pew Research Center Survey&nbsp;released last year&nbsp;found that most Americans weren’t confident in crypto’s safety or reliability. The industry has suffered major blowups in the last few years, including the implosion of the FTX exchange in a huge fraud scandal and the U.S. government’s $4.4 billion settlement with the Binance exchange over allegations that it facilitated financial crimes.</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://theblockchainassociation.org/swingstatevoter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poll released by crypto industry groups</a>&nbsp;this week showed that more than 20 percent of voters in six key swing states identify crypto as a major issue.&nbsp;<a href="https://policy.paradigm.xyz/writing/March-2024-Polling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A separate nationwide survey</a>&nbsp;of registered voters commissioned by the crypto firm Paradigm found that crypto ownership is higher among communities of color and young people — key constituencies that helped boost Biden in 2020 but are now proving to be challenging for him to win over.</p>



<p>Crypto has gained support from politicians on the right who tout it as an alternative to the mainstream financial system. The Paradigm poll found earlier this year that crypto owners favor Trump over Biden, 48 percent to 39 percent, with 13 percent undecided.</p>



<p>“President Trump understands freedom and liberty, he knows that innovation needs to be protected here in America and he knows that the role government should play is to make sure we create an environment in which innovation grows and prospers,” said Ohio GOP Senate candidate Bernie Moreno, a longtime crypto booster. “That’s why it’s no surprise to see him making those comments about crypto.”</p>



<p>Former Republican presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy, who is seen as a potential cabinet official in a second Trump administration, championed crypto during the GOP primary and helped push the former president to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/18/trump-vows-to-block-any-fed-effort-to-launch-digital-currency-00136328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">come out against the adoption of a government-backed central bank digital currency</a>. Crypto firms also oppose a potential Federal Reserve digital currency, and conservatives warn it’s a threat to privacy.</p>



<p>“I was impressed with President Trump’s ability to dive deep into a subject area that was newer to him,” Ramaswamy said in an interview last month.</p>



<p>Ramaswamy declined to comment on whether he hopes to work on crypto policy in a second Trump administration, saying he is “focused on winning the election.”</p>



<p>Trump’s support for digital assets wasn’t always a given. He&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/11/trump-attacks-facebooks-libra-currency-1411914" target="_blank">derided crypto on social media</a>&nbsp;during his presidency, and key cabinet members&nbsp;took a skeptical approach to the industry. Trump’s SEC chair initiated major litigation against a prominent crypto firm.</p>



<p>But Trump has gone on to dabble in crypto since leaving office. He has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/minutes/congress/12-15-2022/donald-trump-nft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued his own NFT</a>, and as of last August he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/16/trump-owns-even-more-crypto-than-first-known-new-documents-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">owned $2.8 million in a crypto wallet</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s pretty remarkable to see, in the few years since he’s left office, the 180 that he has done on crypto,” said Cody Carbone, chief policy officer at the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a crypto advocacy group. “It’s pretty great to see him come out and be supportive of the industry.”</p>



<p>Trump’s embrace of crypto carries potential risks. Digital asset markets have experienced dramatic booms and busts in recent years, and key industry players like Sam Bankman-Fried have been sentenced to prison time for breaking the law.</p>



<p>The shift also carries risk for Washington’s crypto lobby. Trump could make the politics of digital asset regulation even more partisan moving forward. The industry has spent years — as well as millions of dollars in campaign contributions — trying to build support in both parties, which will likely be key to enacting legislation that crypto firms want.</p>



<p>“I don’t want this to become a partisan issue,” Carbone said. “I think this presents an opportunity for Democrats to start to really have an introspective look and educate themselves on the benefits of digital assets.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A new State Department report, criticized as inconclusive, drew immediate fire from both progressive Democrats and Republicans.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Biden administration once again pulled its punches when it comes to Israel.</p>



<p>Despite pressure from Democratic lawmakers and his efforts to stop a major Israeli ground operation in Rafah, President Joe Biden did not use a much-anticipated report on Friday to declare that Israel has violated international law in its war with Hamas. Instead, the State Department document, mandated by a Biden-backed review policy, punted on one of the most controversial issues in the president’s support for Israel.</p>



<p>“It is reasonable to assess” that Israel used American-provided weapons in ways that are “inconsistent” with international law, per the report obtained by POLITICO. It goes on to say that Israel didn’t give the U.S. enough evidence to adjudicate whether those arms were used to violate human rights in Gaza, the West Bank or East Jerusalem.</p>



<p>There have been “sufficient reported incidents to raise serious concerns,” the report continues, flipping between criticism of Israel’s conduct without explicitly calling it out for human rights violations.</p>



<p>Put together, the U.S. offered fodder for both critics and supporters of Israel. There was a whiff of accountability but ultimately no greater reprimand, allowing the Biden administration to continue sending weapons to Israel as it fights Hamas while gingerly appeasing vocal critics. The findings could also be used as a precedent to keep supplying Israel with arms, so long as not enough evidence is produced to clearly prove violations of international law were committed with American weaponry.</p>



<p>The Biden administration promised months ago to issue the report amid growing pressure from Democrats. The goal of the report was to review whether American-provided weapons are being used in conflicts in ways that violate international laws.</p>



<p>The document&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/israel-gaza-state-report-00156619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was originally slated to be released Wednesday</a>, but it was updated right up until it was sent to lawmakers on Friday.</p>



<p>Tensions have been mounting since Biden&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/inside-bidens-public-ultimatum/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to pause a shipment of weapons to Israel containing thousands</a>&nbsp;of warheads over concern about Israel’s plans to invade Rafah without a credible plan to protect civilians. In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Biden threatened to halt additional weapons sales if Israel launches a major ground operation in the southern Gaza city.</p>



<p>But Israel is already conducting operations in Rafah, where more than a million civilians are sheltering.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/08/world/middleeast/israel-incursion-rafah-satellite-image-map.html" target="_blank">Satellite imagery</a>&nbsp;indicates the Israeli forces have already moved beyond the Rafah crossing and into the main area of the city. Biden also recently acknowledged that U.S.-made bombs had killed civilians in the conflict.</p>



<p>The new report has already incensed many members of Congress, especially Republicans who saw it as harsh and unnecessary.</p>



<p>“The administration has given Israel a politically damaging assessment while publicly announcing it is withholding a select set of precision weapons,” Idaho’s Jim Risch, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s ranking member. He added that the president and his administration are “attempting to placate voters on the far left at the expense of a close ally in the midst of its justified war with Hamas terrorists.”</p>



<p>The findings also were outraging to Democratic lawmakers, human rights activists and leaders of non-governmental organizations who say the U.S. cannot keep assisting Israel as it bombards Gaza to root out Hamas militants.</p>



<p>Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), a leading critic of Israel’s conduct in the war, said the administration fell “far short” of its difficult mandate. “It fails to do the hard work of making the assessment and ducks the ultimate questions,” he told reporters Friday evening.</p>



<p>“They are staring at all these trees yet concluding that there’s no forest. It reads like a factual analysis and a politicized conclusion,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International.</p>



<p>“It is clear that Israel is violating international law and obstructing aid into Gaza. In turning a blind eye, the administration is allowing Israel to continue to do so without consequence,” said Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America.</p>



<p>The war began Oct. 7 after Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 others hostage in Gaza. But Israel’s overwhelming response has left some 35,000 Palestinians dead, according to Hamas-controlled Gazan health authorities who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p>



<p>Israel insists that it is following the laws of war and principles of humanitarian aid while doing its best to minimize civilian casualties, even though Hamas militants have embedded themselves and their arsenal within Gaza’s civilian population.</p>



<p>Still, there have been cases where Israeli actions in this war have infuriated U.S. officials. This includes imposing severe restrictions on humanitarian aid allowed to flow into Gaza — where U.S. officials say&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/11/politics/samantha-power-famine-gaza/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">famine has started to take root</a>&nbsp;— as well as an Israeli airstrike that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/02/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-death-of-world-central-kitchen-workers-in-gaza/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killed seven World Central Kitchen workers&nbsp;</a>last month.</p>



<p>White House spokesperson John Kirby declined to confirm the report’s contents earlier on Friday.</p>



<p>“We make clear to any ally or partner who is receiving U.S. military assistance, … make sure they understand our expectations for how those weapons are going to be used in the battlefield,” Kirby said.</p>



<p>Asked by POLITICO if the administration purposefully tried to bury the report right before the weekend, Kirby replied: “The eventual submission of this report is based on the speed work that had to get done to get it ready and not some nefarious effort to make it harder for you guys to report on it.”</p>
