					<description><![CDATA[Belgium, which holds the Council presidency, is meant to act as an honest broker in talks. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The EU’s flagship nature law is “bad” and needs to be revised after the June European election, Belgium’s prime minister said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bloc&#8217;s Nature Restoration Law, which aims to rehabilitate 20 percent of the EU’s degraded land by 2030, is in limbo after a ministerial vote <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/177600" target="_blank">had to be postponed</a>.</p>



<p>Belgium steers the talks on the legislation as the country currently holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU. This means the Belgian government is expected to act as an honest broker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in an interview <a href="https://www.dezondag.be/actua/politiek/premier-alexander-de-croo-open-vld-ons-land-heeft-een-nieuw-politiek-verhaal-nodig/" target="_blank">with De Zondag</a>, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said the bill “may sound good, but it is a bad law.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He added: “I am not against a law that protects our nature, on the contrary. I am against bad legislation. … This needs to go back to the drawing board. Let us find out carefully in the next legislature how we should approach this.”</p>



<p>Alain Maron, the environment minister of the Brussels region, <a href="https://twitter.com/alainmaron/status/1774391156115140884" target="_blank">said</a> De Croo’s comments were “unworthy of a President of the Council.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pointing out that the European Parliament and EU governments had reached an agreement on the law last year, Maron added: “The [law] deserves determination, not weakness.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maron, a Green politician, presided over last week’s environment ministers’ meeting where the bill was meant to be adopted. The Belgian presidency postponed the vote after it became clear that the law did not have the required majority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Belgium was already planning to abstain in any vote on the law, as there was no consensus among its regional governments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nature Restoration Law “will create more uncertainty,” De Croo argued. “Will people still be able to build and do business? …&nbsp; It may mean that you can hardly build and that land that is currently used for agriculture is taken away.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>During negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council, requirements for restoring agricultural land <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/177600" target="_blank">were made voluntary</a> for farmers and private landowners.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Rep. Tim Walberg said he really wasn’t advocating using nuclear weapons.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.) on Sunday said that his recent comment that the war in Gaza should “be like Nagasaki and Hiroshima” was not meant to be taken literally.</p>



<p>The reference by Walberg came in a town hall meeting last week, invoking the nuclear bombings by the United States of Japan that led to Japan’s surrender at the end of World War II, according to a video clip&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4PQ47OEU0Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on YouTube</a>.</p>



<p>“I don’t think any of our aid that goes to Israel to support our greatest ally, arguably maybe in the world, to defeat Hamas and Iran and Russia, and probably North Korea’s in there, and China, too, with them helping Hamas — we shouldn’t be spending a dime on humanitarian aid. It should be like Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Get it over quick. The same should be in Ukraine. Defeat Putin quick,” Walberg can be heard saying in the roughly three-minute clip of the meeting in Dundee, Michigan, posted online.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/RepWalberg/status/1774420222620950574?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement posted</a>&nbsp;on social media Sunday, the Michigan Republican said that the comment was metaphoric.</p>



<p>“As a child who grew up in the Cold War Era, the last thing I’d advocate for would be the use of nuclear weapons. In a shortened clip, I used a metaphor to convey the need for both Israel and Ukraine to win their wars as swiftly as possible, without putting American troops in harm’s way,” Walberg said.</p>



<p>“My reasoning was the exact opposite of what is being reported: the quicker these wars end, the fewer innocent lives will be caught in the crossfire. … The use of this metaphor, along with the removal of context, distorted my message, but I fully stand by these beliefs and stand by our allies,” Walberg continued.</p>



<p>Walberg’s remarks come as the situation in Gaza grows increasingly dire. The death toll in the besieged region has reached over 30,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and 70 percent of the people living there are experiencing catastrophic hunger,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/famine-is-imminent-in-northern-gaza-with-70-percent-of-people-experiencing-catastrophic-hunger-un-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the United Nations</a>. Israel has been fighting in Gaza since Oct. 7, when Hamas launched a deadly incursion into the country, killing 1,2000 and taking others hostage.</p>



<p>Michigan, which Walberg represents, is home to some of the country’s most prominent Arab American cities, as well as Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian American woman to serve in Congress.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Paris would send 'hundreds' of vehicles over the next year, Sébastien Lecornu tells La Tribune Dimanche. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>France will send new surface-to-air missiles and old armored vehicles to Ukraine, the country’s defense minister said on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sébastien Lecornu <a href="https://www.latribune.fr/economie/france/j-exige-la-constitution-de-stocks-pour-produire-des-munitions-sebastien-lecornu-ministre-des-armees-994261.html" target="_blank">told La Tribune Dimanche</a> that President Emmanuel Macron had asked him to design a “new aid package” to help Kyiv defend against Russia&#8217;s invasion.</p>



<p>This will “notably include old equipment from our armies, which is still functional,” he said. “To hold such a long frontline, the Ukrainian army needs, for example, our armored vehicles —&nbsp;this is absolutely key for troop mobility and is part of Ukraine’s requests.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked how many vehicles France would provide, Lecornu said: “We&#8217;re talking in the hundreds for 2024 and early 2025.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He said France would also provide a “new batch of Aster 30 missiles” to Ukraine.“We are also developing <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/1-dead-russia-launches-attacks-094915932.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.yahoo.com/news/1-dead-russia-launches-attacks-094915932.html" target="_blank">remotely operated munitions</a> in a very short timeframe, for delivery to the Ukrainians as early as this summer,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The arms deliveries come amid accusations —&nbsp;by Germany in particular —&nbsp;that Paris is not pulling its weight on military aid to Ukraine. German officials have publicly <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-aid-france-strikes-back-and-publishes-weapons-data-macron-kiel-taurus-scalp/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-aid-france-strikes-back-and-publishes-weapons-data-macron-kiel-taurus-scalp/">voiced frustration</a> with the size of France&#8217;s assistance to Kyiv. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has repeatedly called for an audit of national contributions amid discussions on how to calibrate an EU fund for reimbursing countries for their military donations to Kyiv.</p>



<p>Russia <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-hits-ukraines-energy-infrastructure-gas-production-facilities-2024-03-31/" target="_blank">continued hitting</a> Ukraine’s energy infrastructure on Sunday. A Russian missile strike in Ukraine’s western Lviv region on Sunday killed one man, while another man died in an attack in the northeast, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-energy-infrastructure-de446fa5182eb4b1480783b402b01d9b" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-energy-infrastructure-de446fa5182eb4b1480783b402b01d9b" target="_blank">Associated Press</a> reported.</p>



<p>The Ukrainian air force said it shot down nine of the 11 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, as well as nine out of 14 cruise missiles.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands in Ukraine’s Odesa region were left without power Sunday after debris from a downed Russian drone caused a blaze at an energy facility, the AP reported Gov. Oleh Kiper as saying.</p>



<p>Sunday&#8217;s attacks came just days after <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-ukraine-war-missile-attack-damaged-three-power-plants-in-ukraine/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-ukraine-war-missile-attack-damaged-three-power-plants-in-ukraine/">Moscow unleashed</a> 99 missiles and drones in a massive attack against Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Three power plants were seriously damaged in that onslaught, Ukrainian energy company DTEK <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/DTEKcompany/posts/pfbid0RWvEs5SBBi4WfBzu14UE3DpKT36zmwCnVber9DUuHoB48upG6FX7hQrAs7Wo8h2jl" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>



<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday signed a decree setting out the routine <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-signs-decree-spring-military-conscription-2024-03-31/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-signs-decree-spring-military-conscription-2024-03-31/" target="_blank">spring conscription campaign</a>, calling up 150,000 citizens for military service, a post on the Kremlin&#8217;s website indicated on Sunday. All men in Russia are required to serve one year of compulsory military service.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The former president is considering around a dozen contenders, though the list is in flux.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Donald Trump’s aides are vetting potential vice presidential candidates at Mar-a-Lago as the former president floats an expansive list of names in private conversations.</p>



<p>Susie Wiles, a top adviser to Trump, is leading a close-to-the-vest process of narrowing a list of around a dozen lawmakers and other Republican personalities under consideration, according to multiple people familiar with the process. The campaign has already hired an outside firm to vet candidates and prepare research documents. Former first lady Melania Trump, who influenced Trump’s decision to select Mike Pence in 2016, has been kept apprised. And Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. said he speaks with his father frequently about who is in contention.</p>



<p>While who is up or down seemingly changes by the minute, the list has included everyone from Tim Scott and Kristi Noem to Byron Donalds, Elise Stefanik, Tulsi Gabbard and J.D. Vance, whom Trump has called a “fighter.”</p>



<p>Trump, despite saying he doesn’t think the vice president matters all that much, regularly asks guests at his Mar-a-Lago club for their opinion on different options and, with a flair for suspense, teases his choices in private meetings and media interviews. The process is expected to take months.</p>



<p>“He’s going to draw this out ‘Apprentice’-style,” said one person close to the Trump campaign who was granted anonymity to speak freely.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-reveals-criteria-running-mate-name-drops-two-top-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The former president has said</a>&nbsp;his top criterion is picking someone “who is going to be a good president … in case of emergency.” But Trump is also sensitive to electoral needs, and part of the consideration is having someone who can help expand his appeal in November.</p>



<p>The names under consideration continue to be in flux, according to multiple people familiar with the list, who describe it as being in “pencil, not pen.” But it includes Sens. Scott of South Carolina, Vance of Ohio, Katie Britt of Alabama and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as Govs. Noem of South Dakota, Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas and Doug Burgum of North Dakota. Donalds, the Florida representative, and Gabbard, the former Hawaii representative, among others, are also being considered or have been floated by Trump.</p>



<p>Trump seems to relish the guessing game — which has been going on since he announced his third White House bid in November 2022, but has intensified since he clinched the nomination in March.</p>



<p>During one private meeting several weeks ago in Palm Beach, Florida, he went down the list of possible running mates with visitors, including one member of Congress, offering commentary on each. He spoke highly of Stefanik and Gabbard, according to a person with knowledge of the conversation and granted anonymity to speak freely. And he was dismissive of Scott, suggesting the senator may not be up to the job of being president, if needed.</p>



<p>Still, in a sign of his vacillation, Trump spoke positively about Scott as recently as last week, according to a person familiar with a private conversation with the former president. A spokesperson for Scott declined to comment.</p>



<p>“He’ll ask you about people,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), said in an interview.</p>



<p>The senator cautioned that those names being promoted by Trump allies or political consultants should be treated skeptically. “All I can tell you is, if you’re hearing any names, it ain’t going to be them. It’s all propaganda.”</p>



<p>The former football coach said all the name-floating felt familiar: “Like football coaches whenever there’s a job opening, my agent always put my name in there to get me a raise, get me publicity and all that.” Tuberville echoed Trump’s own advisers, who have expressed annoyance at some of the behind-the-scenes maneuverings of consultants.</p>



<p>Kellyanne Conway, the former senior counselor to Trump in the White House, suggested Trump should choose someone who can <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/05/opinion/trump-vice-president.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank"><u>help him win and govern</u></a>, and not be a distraction as he tries to expand his reach to minority voters, women and political independents. Specifically, she said Trump should select someone who can speak about abortion with “conviction and compassion” and articulate what it means to be a “pro-life Republican” versus “pro-choice Democrat” in 2024.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/30/trump-gop-primary-voters-exurbs-00149822" target="_blank"></a>“Unlike the Democrats who are stuck with a wildly unpopular president and vice president, Trump has an embarrassment of riches in terms of who he can choose,” Conway said in an interview.</p>



<p>She added that when Trump is thinking about vice president he is also considering people for other top positions in a potential administration: “The VP is the most important decision, but he is widely focused on personnel all around.”</p>



<p>But everyone has an opinion about the No. 2 job. Trump Jr. said last week that he speaks with his father frequently about the vice presidential selection process and is pushing him to choose a “fighter.” He implicitly criticized Trump’s former vice president, Pence, who declined to support efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p>



<p>“When people didn’t know Trump beyond sort of the TV personality or the business guy, you needed a little more balance. And I think that made a lot of sense with Mike Pence at the time,” Trump Jr. told POLITICO at a rally for Senate candidate Jim Banks in Indiana. “Now, I think we see where our country is, you need someone who’s actually going to fight.”</p>



<p>One contender Trump has viewed in that light is Vance, whom he called a “fighter” at a rally earlier this month.</p>



<p>“I would be interested in doing it if he asked me, but he also hasn’t asked me,” Vance said in an interview. “I don’t think he’s close to asking anybody. So I think it feels extremely premature.”</p>



<p>As he searches for a running mate this year, those under consideration are finding ways to be helpful with the campaign. Scott, for example, talks with Trump by call or text message nearly weekly, according to a person with knowledge of their relationship and granted anonymity to speak freely. The senator is also highly involved as a Trump campaign surrogate on TV.</p>



<p>Scott is making fundraising calls at the Trump campaign’s request and will attend rallies and fundraising events when asked, including appearing with Trump, Burgum and former GOP primary rival Vivek Ramaswamy next weekend at a big fundraiser in Palm Beach.</p>



<p>Burgum, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination, recently traveled to Nevada as a Trump campaign surrogate to speak to Clark County Republicans. He didn’t rule out serving in the Trump Cabinet or as vice president when pressed last week&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6349339412112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>by Fox News host Neil Cavuto</u></a>.</p>



<p>“I talk to the former president, but I know that he’s going to make a choice about his Cabinet and about who’s vice president at the time of his choosing,” Burgum said, adding that his “name has come up for about a half a dozen different Cabinet positions.”</p>



<p>The significance of a running mate on the election’s outcome has long been the subject of debate. Mitt Romney, who ran for president in 2012, seemed to agree with Trump’s skepticism, saying in an interview, “generally vice president picks make no difference” in an election.</p>



<p>“As they say, VP picks can hurt you, they rarely help you,” Romney said.</p>



<p>But any decision could make a difference in a general election that may be determined in a few critical counties across a handful of battleground states. In 2016, Trump selected Pence to give him conservative bona fides and deliver evangelical voters. And beyond helping Trump in 2024, the next vice presidential nominee may also have a leg up in who Republicans nominate in 2028.</p>



<p>“This person will not only be one heartbeat away from the presidency during President Trump’s next term, but will likely be our nominee in ‘28 and serve as president for the next eight years following President Trump’s term,” said Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who speaks to Trump regularly.</p>



<p>One Republican strategist close to Trump’s campaign said each candidate comes with their own set of baggage: “There’s no one that checks every single box that they’re looking for.” Britt, for one, had a widely panned&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/08/katie-britt-sotu-rebuttal-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>State of the Union</u></a>&nbsp;rebuttal, Noem just made a&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/kristi-noem-dentist-video-texas-dc931ee40c4613c3c5effc1dbfc3ba75" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>strange advertisement for veneers</u></a>, and several hopefuls have come across to Trump as too eager, according to two people close to Trump.</p>



<p>Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said Trump “will choose the best possible person for the job and someone who will fight for America First values.”</p>



<p>Trump is expected to make his decision before the Republican nominating convention in July. But it is likely not imminent, and his campaign faces some calendar restraints. Trump will be preoccupied with court appearances for a month this spring.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Trump’s campaign has turned the running mate selection process into a vehicle for their fundraising emails.</p>



<p>As one such email read recently: “Want to know who my VP will be?”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[New analysis suggests Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's party would win just 98 seats in next election. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak&#8217;s Conservative Party is on track to win fewer than 100 seats in the next election, with Labour likely to score a landslide victory, a new poll suggests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A seat-by-seat analysis based on a survey of 15,000 voters sees Sunak’s governing party winning in just 98 constituencies compared to Labour’s 468, the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/general-election-poll-tory-mp-party-cabinet-seats-6ktnbkt7b" target="_blank">Sunday Times reports</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The poll, conducted by agency <a href="https://www.survation.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.survation.com/" target="_blank">Survation</a> on behalf of the <a href="https://www.bestforbritain.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bestforbritain.org/" target="_blank">Best for Britain</a> campaign group, puts Keir Starmer’s Labour Party at 45 percent of the overall vote, a <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/public-stopped-listening-tories-poll-102914900.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/public-stopped-listening-tories-poll-102914900.html" target="_blank">19-point lead</a> over the Tories. </p>



<p>Reform U.K., the right-wing populist party set up by Nigel Farage, would score 8.5 percent and win seven seats, with the Liberal Democrats getting 22 seats, according to the survey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Wales and Scotland, the Conservatives would see a complete wipeout, winning no seats, according to the report. The analysis gives the Scottish National Party 41 seats and Plaid Cymru two seats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The poll did not account for undecided voters, which represented 15 percent of the people surveyed.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[By calling for conquest, Xi has made an enemy of the Taiwan's tribes, which rightfully say their ancestors inhabited the island long before the dawn of the Chinese era.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Dr. Alexander Görlach is a senior fellow to the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs. He was a visiting scholar in Taiwan and Hong</em><em> Kong</em><em>, and writes extensively about this region of the world.</em></p>



<p>After <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/william-lai-takes-early-lead-in-taiwan-presidential-race-in-snub-to-beijing/">the election of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te</a> in January, political leaders from Beijing to Washington all asserted he’d lean toward what they called “Taiwan’s independence.” And for this presupposed tendency, the Chinese Communist Party and state-controlled media <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-calls-taiwan-president-frontrunner-destroyer-peace-2023-12-31/" target="_blank">labeled Lai a “destroyer of peace</a>,” vowing that the little island nation’s “reunification&#8221; with China was looming.</p>



<p>As a sort of preemptive measure, after Lai’s victory, U.S.-president <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-us-does-not-support-taiwan-independence-2024-01-13/" target="_blank">Joe Biden said that Washington wouldn’t support any sort of declaration of independence</a>, highlighting that his administration seeks to maintain the status quo between the two nations. Biden thereby reiterated the U.S.’s One-China Policy, which &#8220;acknowledges&#8221; Beijing&#8217;s assertion that Taiwan is a part of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) without agreeing to this claim.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contrary to Beijing claims and Washington warnings, however, Lai and his Democratic Progressive Party haven’t shown any inclination toward changing the status quo. Both Lai and outgoing president Tsai Ing-wen say that Taiwan — under the full name “Republic of China” (ROC) — is already an independent state going back to 1912, and thus doesn’t have to seek independence.</p>



<p>As a matter of fact, according to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-parliament-calls-taiwan-independent-country-report-says-james-cleverly-visit-china/">a report issued by the British parliament’s foreign committee last August</a>, Taiwan does, indeed, possess all necessary markers of statehood: a territory, a people, a functioning government and the ability to form foreign relations.</p>



<p>Many countries around the globe maintain quasi-diplomatic relations with the island, and their engagement with Taipei has only increased in the last couple years — not least because the world has grown aware of Beijing’s belligerence toward the island and its inhabitants. However, as it stands, Taiwan has only 12 real diplomatic partners left. And if it were to one day be left with no such partners, it would cease to exist as a state and Beijing could claim it.</p>



<p>Having said all this, however, there is, indeed, talk of independence in Taiwan — though not from the PRC but rather the ROC itself. And there’s an argument to be made that the island’s Indigenous tribes may well hold the key.</p>



<p>Taiwan became part of the ROC after World War II, when Japan had to surrender all its former colonies. But just two years later, another defeat loomed: The ROC’s nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek lost the civil war against Mao Zedong and retreated to Taiwan with his around 2 million followers. Not welcomed there, he erected a military dictatorship that subjugated the whole population, including the island’s 16 Indigenous tribes that had been living there for six millennia.</p>



<p>And today, thoughts of independence from Chiang’s ROC also come from within these Indigenous groups who never really considered themselves to be a part of China to begin with — whether in its imperial, nationalist or communist iterations.</p>



<p>“The only possibility for Taiwan to truly achieve independence from China’s grasp is, in theory, only to first allow the Indigenous tribes of Taiwan to establish an independent nation named ‘Formosa,’” said Chuan-ju Cheng, an associate professor of Indigenous studies at the Taipei University of Education, alluding to the name the Portuguese gave the island when they sailed past it. After that, “the Han people of Taiwan could join the new state,” added Cheng, who is herself a member of the Truku nation in the Hualien mountains to the island’s east.</p>



<p>Most of Taiwan’s Indigenous tribes still live in those mountains, which make up 60 percent of the island’s topography. Neither Dutch, Portuguese nor Spanish sailors and merchants ever conquered these heights or established full control over its people. The same goes for imperial China, which never controlled much more than outposts by the western shores. Only Japanese conquerers at the dawn of the 20th century succeeded in annexing or acquiring all the native land.</p>



<p>“Taiwan&#8217;s Indigenous people, particularly the highland groups, lost their land during the Japanese colonial period and have been unable to reclaim it from the hands of the Republic of China government up to this point,” Chen said.</p>



<p>According to legal scholars, any full reconciliation with Taipei would require some sort of restitution and self-governance — and on that path there has been progress.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,height=683,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/30/GettyImages-1929852073.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4519755"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te | Annabelle Chih/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>The tribes are recognized in today’s democratic Taiwan, their languages are taught in schools, and their cultures are fully supported by the government in Taipei. An increasing number of Taiwanese are also discovering their own Indigenous heritage through widely available DNA analysis — which might also help explain why <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/11/19/taiwan-china-indigenous-peoples-tribes/" target="_blank">more and more people are starting to see themselves as Taiwanese and not Chinese</a>. And among the Taiwanese, there’s a small yet vocal group that wants nothing to do with the once-oppressive ROC and to found an entirely new state.</p>



<p>In a democracy, it’s their full right to express this belief and advocate for it — sentiments that are alien to Beijing’s totalitarianism. Yet, it’s important to note that these views are from being mainstream.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Maintaining the status quo is preferable, no one wishes to change it,” Cheng said — and that’s because living in Taiwan’s democracy as it is now is better than the looming conquest by the dictator next door, who would most certainly reverse all the progress made.</p>



<p>By calling for conquest, Xi has made himself an enemy of Taiwan’s tribes, which rightfully say the island was inhabited by their ancestors long before the dawn of the Chinese era and, therefore, it’s for them to decide its future — not Beijing.</p>



<p>Moreover, Taipei could leverage this newly found union with the First Nations of Taiwan by highlighting their long-standing Indigenous heritage. These tribes reach six millennia back; they set off and <a href="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2022/08/analysis-new-research-sheds-more-light-on-link-between-m-ori-and-taiwan.html" target="_blank">settled the islands of Oceania and reached shores as far as New Zealand</a> — this can be proven by the languages spoken by the Indigenous peoples on all these islands. So, by actively seeking a role in the gatherings and conferences of these First Nations, Taipei can implicitly make a case for Taiwan’s statehood aside from the ROC’s recent past.</p>



<p>However, the relationship isn’t fully untethered. For example, for the Indigenous tribe of the Pingpu, it seems all but impossible to reclaim the land of their forebears, simply because the city of Tainan with its roughly 1.9 million inhabitants is now located there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, in the grand scheme of things, Taiwan’s successful democracy is a good example of how to atone for the wrongdoings and crimes of a colonial past. By contrast, under Xi, the PRC continues to repeat the atrocities of imperialism, building an empire by subjugating the people of Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Hong Kong; intimidating all of its neighbors in the region; and cracking down on local cultures within the PRC.</p>



<p>And if Xi has his way, the Indigenous people of Taiwan would be re subjugated once more, sharing the catastrophic fate of all other peoples forcefully drawn into Beijing’s orbit.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Israeli prime minister has until Monday to abide by a court ruling curtailing subsidies for ultra-Orthodox men.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing a coalition crisis and a Monday deadline over drafting ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military, as the war in Gaza rages on and deepens the country’s political conflicts.</p>



<p>After an Israeli Supreme Court ruling&nbsp;on Thursday curtailing subsidies for ultra-Orthodox men, Netanyahu&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-ultra-orthodox-war-netanyahu-gaza-1536d26e9a2720d19210f513697ff5ed" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/israel-ultra-orthodox-war-netanyahu-gaza-1536d26e9a2720d19210f513697ff5ed" target="_blank">has until Monday</a> to present a plan to dismantle what the court called a system that privileges the ultra-Orthodox at the expense of the secular Jewish public.</p>



<p>If that plan alienates the ultra-Orthodox lawmakers <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-asks-israeli-court-defer-deadline-conscription-controversy-2024-03-28/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-asks-israeli-court-defer-deadline-conscription-controversy-2024-03-28/" target="_blank">on whose support Netanyahu depends</a>, his coalition could weaken and the country could be forced to hold new elections.</p>



<p>In the middle of the coalition crisis, the prime minister&#8217;s office said that Netanyahu would undergo surgery for a hernia Sunday night, following a diagnosis during a routine examination late Saturday. Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Yariv Levin will serve as acting prime minister while Netanyahu is sedated, according to a statement.</p>



<p>The Supreme Court on Thursday <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-asks-israeli-court-defer-deadline-conscription-controversy-2024-03-28/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-asks-israeli-court-defer-deadline-conscription-controversy-2024-03-28/" target="_blank">ordered the suspension of state subsidies</a> for ultra-Orthodox Jews studying in yeshivas instead of doing military service. The ruling could have far-reaching consequences for Netanyahu&#8217;s government and for the tens of thousands of religious men who currently are exempt from mandatory military service.</p>



<p>The court ruling came just days ahead of an April 1 deadline for the Israeli government to agree on a new law to allow the ultra-Orthodox community to avoid being drafted, according to media reports. The government is debating a bill which reportedly seeks to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-29/netanyahu-coalition-in-crisis-over-religious-draft-as-war-rages?srnd=homepage-europe" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-29/netanyahu-coalition-in-crisis-over-religious-draft-as-war-rages?srnd=homepage-europe" target="_blank">strike a compromise</a> by allowing exemptions with limitations.</p>



<p>It is the most serious threat to Netanyahu&#8217;s government since he cobbled together a shaky national unity administration in the days after the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-rockets-airstrikes-tel-aviv-11fb98655c256d54ecb5329284fc37d2" target="_blank">Oct. 7 attack</a> by the Hamas militant group.</p>



<p>The Biden administration, meanwhile, has authorized the transfer of billions of dollars in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/03/29/us-weapons-israel-gaza-war/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/03/29/us-weapons-israel-gaza-war/" target="_blank">bombs and fighter jets to Israel</a> despite U.S. concerns about an anticipated military offensive in southern Gaza. the Washington Post reported. The new arms shipments include more than 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 500 500-pound bombs, according to the report, which cited Pentagon and State Department officials familiar with the matter.</p>



<p> The latest package comes as Washington and others have been raising concerns about increasing civilian deaths in Gaza and humanitarian access to the enclave, which the U.N. says is on the verge of famine.</p>



<p>The Palestinian foreign ministry <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68698357" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68698357" target="_blank">criticized the U.S. for inconsistencies</a> over the Israel-Hamas war. &#8220;Demanding Netanyahu stop killing civilians and supplying him with weapons is an unprecedented principled and moral contradiction,&#8221; it said in a post on social media.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Moscow court charged Antonina Favorskaya with participating in the activities of late Kremlin critic Aleksei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Russian journalist Antonina Favorskaya was charged with extremism on Friday and remanded in custody for two months, according to media reports.</p>



<p>A Moscow court <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-charges-journalist-who-covered-navalny-trials/32883609.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-charges-journalist-who-covered-navalny-trials/32883609.html" target="_blank">formally charged</a> Favorskaya with participating in the activities of late opposition leader Alexei Navalny&#8217;s Anti-Corruption Foundation, which was labeled as extremist in 2021, according to <a href="https://news.sky.com/video/russia-journalist-who-covered-alexei-navalnys-trial-arrested-for-extremism-13104135" data-type="link" data-id="https://news.sky.com/video/russia-journalist-who-covered-alexei-navalnys-trial-arrested-for-extremism-13104135" target="_blank">the reports</a>. The journalist <a href="https://t.me/moscowcourts/2823" data-type="link" data-id="https://t.me/moscowcourts/2823" target="_blank">faces up to six years</a> in prison.</p>



<p>Favorskaya on Feb. 15 recorded <a href="https://news.sky.com/video/russia-journalist-who-covered-alexei-navalnys-trial-arrested-for-extremism-13104135" data-type="link" data-id="https://news.sky.com/video/russia-journalist-who-covered-alexei-navalnys-trial-arrested-for-extremism-13104135" target="_blank">the last video of Navalny</a> at a court hearing he was taking part in via video-link from an Arctic prison. The next day, Navalny suddenly died in the prison.</p>



<p>Favorskaya, a correspondent for independent broadcaster Sotavision, was<a href="https://t.me/sotavisionmedia/28588" target="_blank">&nbsp;detained</a>&nbsp;for a <a href="https://t.me/moscowcourts/2823" data-type="link" data-id="https://t.me/moscowcourts/2823" target="_blank">second time on Wednesday</a> after initially serving a 10-day administrative sentence in the Moscow region on charges of disobeying police orders, Sotavision said in a <a href="https://t.me/sotavisionmedia/28588" data-type="link" data-id="https://t.me/sotavisionmedia/28588" target="_blank">post on Telegram</a>.</p>



<p>She had also extensively covered Navalny&#8217;s funeral in Moscow before she was detained at a cafe on an anonymous tip, the <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/03/28/2-russian-journalists-detained-in-navalny-extremism-case-a84663" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/03/28/2-russian-journalists-detained-in-navalny-extremism-case-a84663" target="_blank">Moscow Times</a> reported. Colleagues of Favorskaya were also detained; the charges against those individuals remain unclear, the newspaper said.</p>



<p>Prosecutors say Favorskaya posted materials on social media that are <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/russian-court-orders-journalist-navalny-145512645.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/russian-court-orders-journalist-navalny-145512645.html" target="_blank">banned in Russia</a>, AFP reported. In court on Friday, she said the case was retribution for an article she wrote about how Navalny was &#8220;tortured&#8221; in prison, according to the report.</p>



<p>Navalny&#8217;s team has <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/russian-court-orders-journalist-navalny-145512645.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/russian-court-orders-journalist-navalny-145512645.html" target="_blank">condemned the case</a> and said the Russian regime was trying to create a &#8220;new wave of fear&#8221; among its critics.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ukrainian president also dismisses three advisers and two other officials.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed a longtime aide and several advisers on Saturday in a continuing reshuffle of the top ranks in Kyiv.</p>



<p>Zelenskyy dismissed top aide Serhiy Shefir from his post of first assistant, where he had served since 2019, according to a <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/documents/2072024-50289" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.president.gov.ua/documents/2072024-50289" target="_blank">brief statement</a> issued on Saturday. The Ukrainian president also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-reshuffle-143897f01e56fec1303c63766c0cc5f1" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-reshuffle-143897f01e56fec1303c63766c0cc5f1" target="_blank">let go three advisers</a>, as well as two presidential representatives overseeing volunteer activities and soldiers’ rights, according to <a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-president-dismisses-longtime-friend-105100732.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://au.news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-president-dismisses-longtime-friend-105100732.html" target="_blank">media reports</a>.</p>



<p>No explanation was given for the latest changes in a wide-reaching personnel shakeup over recent months. Saturday&#8217;s moves follow the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/zelenskyy-yanks-outspoken-security-council-boss-appoints-spy-chief-in-his-stead/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/zelenskyy-yanks-outspoken-security-council-boss-appoints-spy-chief-in-his-stead/">dismissal on Tuesday of Oleksii Danilov</a>, who served as secretary of the National Security and Defense Council. Danilov is being replaced by Oleksandr Lytvynenko, head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence service.</p>



<p>Last month, Zelenskyy removed Valerii Zaluzhnyi as head of the armed forces. He was appointed Ukraine’s&nbsp;ambassador to the United Kingdom&nbsp;earlier this month.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://t.me/s/kpszsu" data-type="link" data-id="https://t.me/s/kpszsu" target="_blank">Ukraine’s air force said</a> on Saturday that Russia launched 12 Shahed drones overnight, nine of which were shot down, and fired four missiles into eastern Ukraine. Russia has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-reshuffle-143897f01e56fec1303c63766c0cc5f1" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-reshuffle-143897f01e56fec1303c63766c0cc5f1" target="_blank">unleashed a barrage</a> of 38 missiles, 75 airstrikes and 98 attacks from multiple rocket launchers over the last 24 hours, Ukraine’s armed forces said in social media posts.</p>



<p>Ukrainian energy company Centrenergo announced on Saturday that the Zmiiv Thermal Power Plant, one of the largest thermal power plants in the eastern Kharkiv region, was destroyed following Russian shelling last week. Power outage schedules were still in place for around 120,000 people in the region, where 700,000 people had lost electricity after the plant was hit on March 22, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-reshuffle-143897f01e56fec1303c63766c0cc5f1" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-reshuffle-143897f01e56fec1303c63766c0cc5f1" target="_blank">Associated Press reported</a>.</p>



<p>Russia has escalated its&nbsp;attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure recently, causing significant damage in several regions. Officials in the Poltava region said Saturday there had been “several hits” to an infrastructure facility, without specifying whether it was an energy facility.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[By failing to publish a report on the nation's colonial history, Belgium signals it is not yet ready to shake off its past.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Belgium&#8217;s attempts to confront its brutal colonial past keep running into problems.</p>



<p>After two years of work by a parliamentary commission, a report was drawn up earlier this year, along with political recommendations on the next steps the country should take. But the full report, as well as its recommendations, has not been released to the public.</p>



<p>The point of contention? Apologizing to the former colonies, including the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Rwanda.</p>



<p>It comes against a backdrop of a looming national election, and attempts&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/decolonizing-cities-king-leopold-ii-black-lives-matter-belgium-colonial-history/" target="_blank">to foster</a>&nbsp;awareness of and contextualize — but not remove — the numerous colonial monuments still found all across Brussels and elsewhere.</p>



<p>In the latest example of this effort, the authorities this month unveiled an art installation that aims to contextualize the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_to_the_Belgian_Pioneers_in_Congo" target="_blank">colonial monument</a>&nbsp;in Brussels&#8217; Parc du Cinquantenaire glorifying Belgian colonizers who conquered Congo.

<p>Yet a formal apology for Belgium&#8217;s atrocities during the era of Leopold II remains a big no-no for the country.</p>



<p>The parliamentary commission came into existence in June 2020 in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests and was expected to come up with recommendations on how Belgium should best deal with the legacy of colonialism as well as racism and discrimination in the country. On the commission were MPs from across the political spectrum. </p>



<p>It was problematic from the get-go.</p>



<p>“Some of the members of the commission were not in favor of its existence … when it&#8217;s so political, it&#8217;s risky,” said historian Valérie Rosoux, who worked on the report.<strong> </strong></p>



<p>Belgium’s King Philippe broke the royal family&#8217;s silence on the subject in 2020 when he&nbsp;<a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/121931" data-type="link" data-id="https://pro.politico.eu/news/121931" target="_blank">expressed</a> “profound regret” for the wounds of the colonial past and the “acts of violence and cruelty&#8221; committed under Belgian occupation on the 60th anniversary of Congo’s independence.</p>



<p>Several years later, the notion of a formal apology remains just as contentious and ultimately was the reason why the commission failed.<br><br>&#8220;Why should all Belgians today apologize?&#8221; <a href="https://www.letemps.ch/monde/europe/belgique-echoue-presenter-excuses-passe-colonial" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.letemps.ch/monde/europe/belgique-echoue-presenter-excuses-passe-colonial" target="_blank">asked</a> Flemish liberal Maggie De Block in December 2022 when the commission finished its work.</p>



<p>Tensions flared up again earlier this year after the lawmakers in favor of an apology attempted to bring the publication of the report back onto the agenda.</p>



<p>But nothing has changed: MPs who sat on the commission from the French-speaking liberals (MR), the Flemish far right (Vlaams Belang), and the Flemish nationalists (N-VA) were opposed to the publication of the report.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A non-existent commission</strong></h3>



<p>“What happened was that the commission was dissolved after we failed to agree on recommendations.<em>&nbsp;</em>We cannot publish the report of a commission that does not exist anymore,” MR member of parliament Benoit Piedboeuf <a href="https://www.rtbf.be/article/commission-passe-colonial-deux-ans-de-travaux-pour-rien-11322110" target="_blank">told</a> Le Soir.</p>



<p>But according to historian Sarah Van Beurden, who participated in writing the preliminary report, the parliament is hiding behind a technicality. “If there is enough political will, they can find a way to make it happen,” she said, adding that not publishing the report represents “a deep political failure.”</p>



<p>&#8220;I almost don&#8217;t have words for it. I think it&#8217;s deeply politically irresponsible, but also sort of irresponsible on the human level … it’s deeply offensive on a human level to those who devoted their time to testimonies and hearings,&#8221; said Van Beurden.</p>



<p>Geneviève Kaninda, coordinator of Collectif Mémoire Coloniale et Lutte contre les Discriminations, a movement aiming to decolonize society, said publishing the report was a question of decency. “Colonization was a really horrible story,” she said. “It’s not about decolonization anymore, it’s about how a couple of political parties can hold a parliament hostage.”</p>



<p>Some 200 historians and several politicians have now signed a petition asking the parliament to <a href="https://www.lesoir.be/564645/article/2024-01-30/lappel-de-plus-de-200-personnalites-pour-la-publication-du-rapport" target="_blank">publish</a> the report. </p>



<p>“This was the first time that the parliament of the ancient colonial power was coping with its political past, which is a traumatic and dark past, the historical importance is quite obvious … the researchers all over the world should be able to consult the results,” said Wouter De Vriendt, a Green MP who chaired the commission.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A detailed report</h3>



<p>The almost 700-page report, shared with POLITICO, builds on testimonials from about 300 academics, diplomats and witnesses, as well as upon visits to former colonies. Parts of the report have been published on the parliament’s website, but the documents are not easy to find.</p>



<p>“I have no issue with publication of the report, what I am against is the publication of the political recommendations,” Thomas Roggeman, of the N-VA, told POLITICO, adding that the commission took a different turn over the years. “In the end, it was just about getting votes in the African communities, nothing to do with historical past.”</p>



<p>In 2022, those working on the report failed to find consensus on the notion of apologies to be made to the former colonies. Some claimed this would have led to financial reparations, even though one of the political recommendations states that the &#8220;recognition of Belgium&#8217;s role is sincere and necessary. It does not, however, imply any legal liability, and therefore cannot give rise to any financial reparation.”<br><br>Other recommendations — there are 128 in total — include the establishment of a Remembrance Day, the creation of a knowledge center, and facilitating easier visa procedures for scholars in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Rwanda.</p>



<p>“There were also practical things that could change the way in which the colonial past is represented in the public sphere, how the colonial collections are handled or change the way Congolese historians struggle to get visas to access archival collections in Belgium … and they just swept all of it off the table,” said Van Beurden.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>&#8216;Belgo-Belge issue</strong>&#8216;</h2>



<p>It’s not the first time Belgium has set up a commission aimed at dealing with its colonial past. One of the most notable was the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/lumumba-tooth-belgium-unfinished-reckoning-colonial-past/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/lumumba-tooth-belgium-unfinished-reckoning-colonial-past/">Lumumba Commission</a>, which concluded that &nbsp;Belgium was “morally responsible” for the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, the first democratically elected prime minister of Congo. <br><br>“It was a Belgian exercise. It’s what the Congolese like to call the Belgo-Belge issue,” said Van Beurden. “The Belgians are going to discuss this amongst themselves and then they’re going to make judgments about the colonial past that concern all of us. So there was skepticism from the beginning about the process.”<br><br>Nyanchama Okemwa, chair of the European Network Against Racism (ENAR), who has been living in Belgium for 30 years, was also dubious about the idea from the start.</p>



<p>“I was very sure it was not going to work, even when it started. Because how do you start when you have not yet even understood that your laws are obsolete? And that your policy is anchored upon obsolete ways of thinking,” she said.<br><br>According to Okemwa, the colonial mentality is embedded in Belgium and it will take many years to change that.</p>



<p>“Belgium is now very diverse, but this diversity is not reflected in the law,” she said, adding that compared to 30 years ago, the country has changed. </p>



<p>“I would not be doing this job for 30 years if I didn&#8217;t see certain changes. I&#8217;m very patient; the changes are slow, but they are happening. We cannot expect a problem of 500 years to change overnight.”</p>
