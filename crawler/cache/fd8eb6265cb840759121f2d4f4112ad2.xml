					<description><![CDATA[Bipartisan legislation would let the U.S. seize $5B to $8B in Russian assets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Congress is gearing up to give President Joe Biden a powerful new financial tool to strengthen Ukraine, in a move that could redefine modern economic diplomacy.</p>



<p>At issue is bipartisan legislation approved by House and Senate committees that would let the administration confiscate around $5 billion to $8 billion in Russian sovereign assets under U.S. jurisdiction and use the money to help finance Ukraine’s recovery. Discussions on the plans are expected to ramp up in the coming weeks as Congress hashes out a new Ukraine aid bill.</p>



<p>In a Fox News interview Sunday, Speaker Mike Johnson floated the Russian asset seizure proposal as one of the ideas that Republicans will pursue in response to a Biden administration request for more Ukraine aid. In addition, he signaled that Republicans may try to provide some of the Ukraine aid as a loan and are also weighing an expansion of U.S. natural gas exports to “un-fund” Russia’s war effort.</p>



<p>The next move by lawmakers on seizing Russian assets is poised to set a new precedent for how the U.S. navigates future geopolitical conflicts.</p>



<p>“When you look at global power rivals, you have to recognize you have a military, diplomatic and economic diplomacy that must be coordinated and must be effective,” Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), one of the drivers of the effort, said in an interview. “To me, this is a significant part of economic diplomacy that goes way beyond adding more names to a sanctions list that aren’t going to ever be sanctioned.”</p>



<p>While the policy has been taking shape for several months, a series of tense issues and key details still need to be resolved.</p>



<p>A big underlying concern among some lawmakers looking to help Ukraine is that it could be seen as a substitute for enacting more aid, which leaders on the legislation say it’s not.</p>



<p>On the global stage, the general idea has also run into some resistance in Europe, where most of the frozen assets at issue — around $200 billion — are held. EU leaders are moving ahead in a more narrow fashion by <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/euroclear-missing-profits-ukraine-eu-russia-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clawing back profits</a> from Russian assets immobilized there, rather than seizing them outright. Part of the thinking behind the U.S. legislation is that it would help make the EU more comfortable with the more legally, politically and economically fraught step of confiscation. Amid European unease, the question of whether the U.S. should have to get G7 buy-in to seize the smaller pool of Russian assets under its jurisdiction has also been one of the points of debate on Capitol Hill.</p>



<p>“It would substantially strengthen the ability of the U.S. if it chose to seize the reserves,” said David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings. “That’s important because even though there are not a lot of reserves in the U.S. — they’re mostly in Europe — it would give the U.S. more backbone to push the Europeans to do more.”</p>



<p>Hill has been heavily involved in the legislation as a member of House Foreign Affairs, which approved it, and House Financial Services, which has separate jurisdiction over economic sanctions. Hill is a former banker, Treasury Department official and Senate aide.</p>



<p>While he’s been supportive of the main House bill, known as the REPO for Ukrainians Act, Hill is also pushing to expand the umbrella of potential funds that could be seized and how they could be used. For example, he wants the legislation to go beyond Russian sovereign assets and also cover state-owned enterprises. He’s tried to help rally Europe behind the confiscation plan, including via a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-make-russia-pay-for-ukraine-frozen-reserves-albania-us-putin-house-bill-248f742b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joint Wall Street Journal op-ed</a> with Albanian lawmaker Lulzim Basha. He wrote in <a href="https://hill.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=9269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a separate piece</a> with former Speaker Newt Gingrich last month that the U.S. “cannot wait for G7 approval to lead or act.”</p>



<p>“You had a sovereign country invade another sovereign country using the most brutal warfare possible,” Hill said. “It’s not a civil war. It’s an invasion by a P5 member of the United Nations violating every international law that we know. And therefore, when there is a peace settlement, Russia owes to that sovereign neighbor some form of reparation. This is an excellent way to establish a fund for reconstruction of Ukraine following peace.”</p>



<p>The Biden administration has also warmed up to the idea. A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said the administration supports the goals of the “robust bipartisan REPO for Ukrainians Act introduced in the Senate.” The administration is also in active conversations with allies and partners including the G7 “to ensure we are all coordinated in making Russia pay.”</p>



<p>Staff for House Foreign Affairs Republicans said the differences between the House and Senate approaches are bridgeable and that the real-world impacts of the two plans would be close, if not identical. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/faf98acc-a22c-a542-2cc7-64f91f027fa4/01%2024%202024%20--%20Business%20Meeting%20--%20as%20of%20Feb.%208%20--%20compressed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the lone vote against</a> the Senate version in committee.</p>



<p>But the REPO bills aren’t the only game in town. Some House Democrats are also pushing for the chamber to take up a separate bipartisan bill by Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) that would impose a 100 percent tax on the income from Russian assets, echoing the approach taking shape in Europe. One House Democratic aide said it could “garner broad international support, and this would continue to pay over time.”</p>



<p>“These bills can move together as they did when approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee,” Doggett said in a statement. “I am a cosponsor of Chair [Michael] McCaul’s REPO legislation, and he is supportive of my bill. We both seek every reasonable way to hold [Vladimir] Putin accountable and offer at least modest restitution to a long-suffering Ukraine.”</p>



<p>What would happen if Congress enacted REPO? Peterson Institute senior fellow Nicolas Véron said he’s “very skeptical” the U.S. would act on the assets before Europe. European leaders face a host of fears that may hold them back, including concerns about the future of the euro as a reserve currency and Russian retaliation. Unlike the paralyzed U.S. Congress, Europe <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-ukraine-aid-war-50-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has also pledged</a> €50 billion in Ukraine aid, in addition to tapping earnings from Russian assets.</p>



<p>“I find it unlikely the U.S. would confiscate without doing it jointly with Europeans,” said Véron, who’s also a senior fellow at the Brussels think tank Bruegel. “It would create perceptions that it’s more risky to hold reserves in dollars than in euros, and I’m not sure the U.S. government wants to do that.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Some of the weapons could take years to arrive in Israel, but the move comes as the administration faces pressure to condition arms transfers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. government is considering major new weapons sales to Israel of fighter jets, air-to-air missiles and guidance kits, as calls grow for the U.S. to withhold arms if Israel won’t do more to limit civilian casualties in Gaza.</p>



<p>The Biden administration is weighing selling Israel up to 50 new F-15 fighter jets, 30 AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles, and a number of Joint Direct Attack Munition kits, which turn dumb bombs into precision-guided weapons, according to a congressional aide and a person familiar with the discussions. The people were granted anonymity to speak ahead of an announcement.</p>



<p>While the sale is still pending U.S. government approval — and it will be years before the weapons arrive in Israel — the administration has already informally notified the relevant congressional committees, according to the congressional aide. That step typically means the administration is ready to move forward with the sale.</p>



<p>A Defense Department spokesperson referred questions to the State Department. A State Department spokesperson said the department does not comment on potential future sales.</p>



<p>News of the potentially pending agreements comes as critics inside and outside the U.S. government say President Joe Biden has a responsibility to limit weapons sales to Israel as the death toll rises in Gaza. Even members of Biden’s party have recently criticized Israel harshly for its operations in the enclave. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish official in the U.S. government and historically a strong ally of Israel, last month called for new Israeli elections, prompting outrage from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.</p>



<p>It also comes amid a rift among Democrats about whether Biden should leverage arms sales in his efforts to pressure Netanyahu not to launch a large-scale invasion of the southern city of Rafah, where more than 1 million civilians are sheltering from fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants in the north.</p>



<p>Hamas still holds over 100 Israeli hostages — the majority of them civilians — after snatching them during its Oct. 7 assault on Israeli towns, and officials are negotiating swapping hostages for Palestinian prisoners.</p>



<p>Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/12/rafah-gaza-israel-biden-netanyahu-weapons-00146586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>has said that blocking sales of offensive weapons</u></a>, something Biden has been reluctant to do, should be under consideration.</p>



<p>Josh Paul, who resigned from the State Department in protest over America’s continued lethal assistance to Israel, said the consummation of the deal would be “further proof” that the administration is unwilling to take a tough tack with Netanyahu.</p>



<p>“I think for all the president’s talk of wanting to restrain Israel’s operations in Rafah, this is continuing evidence that in practice, the administration continues to move on transfers for Israel, regardless of the situation on the ground in Gaza and the political context in the U.S.,” Paul said. “It is committed to its support for Israel, and this is proof of that.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tehran said senior commander was killed in the blast, which it said was conducted by Israel.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An explosion in the Syrian capital, Damascus, has leveled an Iranian diplomatic mission and killed a senior commander in Tehran&#8217;s armed forces, Syrian and Iranian media <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/building-close-iranian-embassy-hit-syria-iranian-media-report-2024-04-01/" target="_blank">claimed</a> Monday.</p>



<p>In what could be a dramatic escalation in the conflict in the Middle East, Iran said the blast resulted from a strike by Israeli warplanes. Six people are <a href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1403/01/13/3061796/%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%AF%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B3%D9%BE%D8%A7%D9%87-%D9%82%D8%AF%D8%B3-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%AA-%D8%B1%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%82" target="_blank">reported</a> to have died, including Mohammad Reza Zahedi, an officer in an elite unit of Iran&#8217;s Revolutionary Guards Corps. </p>



<p>According to Iranian state media, several diplomats were also killed, although the ambassador, Hossein Akbari, is <a href="https://nournews.ir/fa/news/169045/%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%B1%DA%98%DB%8C%D9%85-%D8%B5%D9%87%DB%8C%D9%88%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%B3%D8%AA%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86-%DA%A9%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%87-%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85" target="_blank">reported</a> to have been unharmed.</p>



<p>Photos and <a href="https://twitter.com/TreyYingst/status/1774835571845714186?s=20" target="_blank">videos from the scene</a> appear to show the building flattened, with emergency services personnel sifting through the rubble. </p>



<p>Responding to the news, Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad &#8220;strongly condemned&#8221; the alleged attack and said &#8220;the Israeli occupation entity will not be able to impact ties between Iran and Syria.&#8221; Tehran has provided military support to the Syrian regime since the start of the country&#8217;s civil war in 2011.</p>



<p>Speaking to his Syrian counterpart later on Monday, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian claimed that Israel was behind the alleged strike, which he described as “a breach of all international conventions.”</p>



<p>The Israeli Ministry of Defense didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment from POLITICO, although a spokesman told other media outlets, including Reuters: &#8220;We do not comment on reports in foreign media.&#8221;</p>



<p>Israel has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-shifts-deadlier-strikes-iran-linked-targets-syria-2024-01-08/" target="_blank">repeatedly carried out air strikes against Iranian targets in Syria</a> and Iran-backed Hezbollah militias in Lebanon since the start of its war against Tehran&#8217;s ally, Hamas, in Gaza in October.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[French foreign minister made comments during visit to China.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>China should reason with Russia about the war in Ukraine, said French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné in Beijing. </p>



<p>The Chinese government “plays a key role in &#8230; the respect of international law, including on Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty, and therefore we are clearly expecting that China will send very clear messages to Russia,” <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240401-france-expects-clear-messages-from-china-to-russia-over-ukraine-war" target="_blank">Séjourné said during a press conference</a> in the Chinese capital speaking alongside his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi.</p>



<p>Séjourné&#8217;s comments come as Chinese President Xi Jinping <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/177248" target="_blank">is expected</a> to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris in early May. </p>



<p>China presents itself as neutral on the Ukraine war and hasn&#8217;t formally condemned Russia for the invasion. Instead, Beijing has <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20231018-xi-praises-deepening-trust-between-china-and-russia-in-talks-with-putin" target="_blank">deepened ties</a> with Moscow — even <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/russia-china-completely-abandon-us-dollar-in-bilateral-trade-says-russian-pm-671667" target="_blank">deciding to ditch</a> the United States dollar for bilateral trade.  </p>



<p>Last month, China&#8217;s special envoy for Eurasian affairs <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-see-crisis-eventually-resolved-through-talks-chinas-special-envoy-2024-03-22/" target="_blank">warned about</a> the war escalating and said both Ukraine and Russia “agree that negotiations, rather than guns, will ultimately end this war.” China <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/177248" target="_blank">wants</a> Europe to let Russia sit at the table for future peace talks — or Beijing will boycott such discussions. </p>



<p>Séjourné also said France doesn&#8217;t want to “decouple” from the Chinese economy, but rather engage in an “economic rebalancing” to make sure the trade ties are “healthy and sustainable.”</p>



<p>The European Union has been <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/177481" target="_blank">developing rules</a> to de-risk Europe&#8217;s economy and make sure it&#8217;s not overly reliant on China. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Berlin “smoke-in” marked the occasion.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Germany&#8217;s new law legalizing recreational cannabis use came into effect on April 1. </p>



<p>At midnight, hundreds of Berliners held a “smoke-in” at the Brandenburg Gate to publicly consume marijuana and celebrate decriminalization. </p>



<p>Germany is the third country in the European Union to legalize recreational use of cannabis, after Malta in 2021 and Luxembourg in 2023, <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2024/04/01/en-allemagne-la-legalisation-du-cannabis-a-usage-recreatif-entre-en-vigueur_6225294_3210.html" target="_blank">according to Agence France-Presse</a>. </p>



<p>Medical associations, police organizations and judges have misgivings about the law, arguing that marijuana can have a negative effect on the brain, which is still developing up until age 25 —&nbsp;or that the rules are not clear enough. </p>



<p>The legislation was <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/176101" target="_blank">part of an agreement</a> by the country’s three-party coalition government. It allows the possession of cannabis possession (up to 25 grams) and home cultivation for adults (up to three plants). </p>



<p>Cannabis consumption may “now come out of the taboo zone,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Karl_Lauterbach/status/1774709282161750231" target="_blank">posted German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach</a> on X (formerly Twitter) Monday morning. He&#8217;d argued that <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/cannabis-possession-cultivation-legal-germany-april/">legalization</a> would help shut down the black market.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">VIDEO: Berlin holds &#39;smoke-in&#39; as recreational cannabis use law comes into force.<br><br>Several hundred cannabis enthusiasts gathered at midnight under the Brandenburg Gate to smoke marijuana in public as the new law legalising its recreational use comes into effect on April 1 <a href="https://t.co/gULtOS5P55" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/gULtOS5P55</a></p>&mdash; AFP News Agency (@AFP) <a href="https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1774708292495000021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">April 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>Further parts of the legislation will allow “cannabis social clubs” to supply up to 500 members with a daily maximum of 25 grams and a monthly maximum of 50 grams. Members will have to have been residents of Germany for at least six months. </p>



<p>Those clubs won&#8217;t be fully operational before summer, however, as the part of the law that regulates cultivation in cannabis clubs will come into effect on July 1. </p>



<p>Consuming marijuana remains forbidden in a radius of 100 meters around schools, child care facilities and playgrounds. </p>

<p>The worldwide phenomenon of unexplained health incidents known as Havana Syndrome may be linked to Russia’s military intelligence agency GRU,&nbsp;according to a wide-ranging investigation published by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://theins.ru/en/politics/270425" target="_blank">the Insider</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPSD1SUYCY" target="_blank">60 Minutes</a> and <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/havanna-syndrom-setzten-russische-agenten-mikrowellenwaffen-gegen-us-diplomaten-ein-a-1d5d1c2e-ed83-44c8-a446-45bb50f712d5" target="_blank">der Spiegel</a>. </p>



<p>&#8220;Members of the Kremlin’s infamous military intelligence sabotage squad have been placed at the scene of suspected attacks on overseas U.S. government personnel and their family members,&#8221; the Insider, which is based in Riga, Latvia, writes. </p>



<p>In the past decade, more than 100 cases of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/06/havana-syndrome-pentagon-research-00085686" target="_blank">unexplained health incidents</a>&nbsp;have been recorded worldwide — affecting American spies, diplomats, military officers, contractors — and in some cases their spouses, children and pets. Dubbed Havana Syndrome after what was initially thought to be the first patient — a CIA agent in the Cuban capital — was affected in 2016, symptoms include ringing in the ears, chronic headaches and lasting psychophysiological impairment. </p>



<p>Now, evidence gathered by the three media outlets present links to GRU&#8217;s Unit 29155, an entity entirely dedicated to assassination and political destabilization. “Their mission is to find, fix, and finish, all in support of Vladimir Putin’s imperial dreams,” a former high-ranking CIA officer told Insider. </p>



<p>Clues include geolocation of Russian operatives in places across the globe before or during the appearance of Havana Syndrome — known formally within the United States government as anomalous health incidents, or AHIs. Patients also identified Russian agents known to have worked in the unit from photos, the investigation outlines.</p>



<p>Causing Havana Syndrome is reportedly the use of directed energy weapons — and senior members of Unit 29155 have received awards for developing “non-lethal acoustic weapons,” the investigation reports. </p>



<p>Additionally, health incidents might not have started in the Cuban capital in 2016, as originally thought — but rather at the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt in 2014 a few months after Putin illegally annexed Crimea. </p>



<p>More recently, nearly a dozen U.S. officials suffered from an attack involving Havana Syndrome symptoms ahead of a visit by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris in 2021 to Hanoi, 60 Minutes reported. As part of the investigation, evidence emerged indicating that Russia may be sending long-range acoustic weapons to foreign governments such as Vietnam.</p>



<p>A U.S. intelligence report from last year found that a foreign adversary was &#8220;very unlikely&#8221; to be involved in the ailment. According to AHI victims contacted by the media, the U.S. government has not officially recognized a cause for the syndrome. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[European Public Prosecutor's Office looking into texts between Ursula von der Leyen and boss of Pfizer.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Top European prosecutors are investigating allegations of criminal wrongdoing in connection with vaccine negotiations between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the CEO of Pfizer, according to a<strong> </strong>spokesperson from the Liège prosecutor&#8217;s office. </p>



<p>Investigators from the European Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office (EPPO) have in recent months taken over from Belgian prosecutors investigating von der Leyen over &#8220;interference in public functions, destruction of SMS, corruption and conflict of interest,&#8221; according to legal documents seen by POLITICO and a spokesperson from the Liège prosecutor&#8217;s office.&nbsp;While EPPO’s prosecutors are investigating alleged criminal offenses, no one has yet been charged in connection with the case.</p>



<p>The probe was originally opened by Belgian judicial authorities in the city of Liège in early 2023 after a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/criminal-complaint-frederic-baldan-european-commission-president-ursula-von-der-leyen-pfizer-albert-bourla-coronavirus-vaccine/">criminal complaint</a> lodged by local lobbyist Frédéric Baldan. He was later joined by the Hungarian and Polish governments — although the latter is in the process of withdrawing its complaint after the election win by a pro-EU government led by Donald Tusk, a Polish government spokesperson told POLITICO.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Baldan’s complaint centered around an alleged exchange of text messages between von der Leyen and Pfizer boss Albert Bourla in the run-up to the EU’s biggest vaccine deal at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, in an affair dubbed “Pfizergate.” </p>



<p>The New York Times, which first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/world/europe/european-union-pfizer-von-der-leyen-coronavirus-vaccine.html" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the exchange had taken place as the two leaders hashed out the terms of the deal, has launched a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/new-york-times-sue-european-union-ursula-von-der-leyen-pfizer-texts/">parallel lawsuit</a> against the Commission after it refused to disclose the content of the messages following an access to documents request.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>News that EPPO is now investigating the case risks putting further scrutiny on the Commission president&#8217;s role in the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/covid19-european-commission-ursula-von-der-leyen-pfizer-the-eu-and-disappearing-ink/">mega vaccine deal</a>, which had an estimated value of over €20 billion. EPPO leads pan-European investigations into financial crimes, and in theory could seize phones and other relevant material from Commission offices or in other countries in Europe such as von der Leyen&#8217;s native Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The development comes at a delicate moment for the EU’s chief, as she navigates the transition to what Brussels observers expect will be a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-second-term-european-commission-president/">second term</a> at the head of the Berlaymont.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Commission has so far refused to reveal the content of the text messages, or even confirm their existence. </p>



<p>The deal, negotiated at the height of the pandemic in 2021, was originally seen as a triumph for von der Leyen. But the sheer amount of vaccines purchased has since raised eyebrows, with POLITICO revealing late last year that there were at least <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-bonfire-covid-vaccines-coronavirus-waste-europe-analysis/">€4 billion</a> worth of wasted doses. The vaccine contract with Pfizer has since been <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-pfizer-renegotiate-coronavirus-vaccine-contract/">renegotiated</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/secrecy-around-von-der-leyens-vaccine-texts-hurting-eu-reputation/">Transparency campaigners</a> and some <a href="https://twitter.com/Lega_gruppoID/status/1773027869360288120?s=20" target="_blank">political opponents</a> have sought to put pressure on the Commission to discuss the case, but von der Leyen has so far avoided addressing it. In a reply to a direct question put to her by POLITICO about missing text messages, von der Leyen <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/politico-eu-influence/uber-files-postmortem-2/">said</a>: “Everything necessary about that has been said and exchanged. And we will wait for the results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.eppo.europa.eu/en/news/ongoing-eppo-investigation-acquisition-covid-19-vaccines-eu#:~:text=The%20European%20Public%20Prosecutor's%20Office,made%20public%20at%20this%20stage." target="_blank">2022</a>, EPPO announced it was looking into the EU’s vaccine procurement more generally, but this is the first time that the office has been linked with Pfizergate explicitly. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Trading legal barbs&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The case now being looked at by EPPO brings together several different legal, political and financial strands — and it intersects with lawsuits that pharmaceutical giant Pfizer brought against Hungary and Poland.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/29/GettyImages-1365349654-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4519077" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/29/GettyImages-1365349654.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/29/GettyImages-1365349654.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The sheer amount of vaccines purchased since the vaccine deal has since raised eyebrows, with POLITICO revealing late last year that there were at least €4 billion worth of wasted doses. | Sean Gallup/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>Last year, Baldan, a 36-old Belgian lobbyist with ties to vaccine-skeptic group Bon Sens, lodged a criminal complaint in Belgium in connection to von der Leyen’s role in the vaccine negotiations with Pfizer over what he alleges were acts of &#8220;interference in public functions, destruction of SMS, corruption and conflict of interest,&#8221; according to legal information provided by his lawyer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The addition of European governments to his complaint adds weight to what might otherwise have been seen as a personal crusade. Hungary, led by Viktor Orbán, a steadfast opponent of von der Leyen, also filed a complaint in connection to the Commission president’s role in vaccine negotiations with Pfizer, according to two insiders with knowledge of the case, speaking on condition of anonymity because of its sensitivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Poland lodged its own complaint last November, a Polish government spokesperson confirmed. However, following the election of Tusk in December, “the new government is working [to] withdraw Poland from these proceedings,” the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The details of the case are not public but the insiders said that while the complaint brought by Hungary is distinct from Baldan’s, it centers on the same text message exchange. Poland’s complaint was along the same lines, the two people familiar with the details of the case said.</p>



<p>Both Hungary and Poland are also <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/pfizer-biontech-sues-hungary-pandemic-court-cases-mount-covid-19/">being sued by Pfizer</a> over missing payments for vaccine doses after stopping deliveries, citing oversupply and the financial strain of the Ukraine war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A European Commission official said the Commission had no knowledge about possible proceedings other than from press articles. </p>



<p>The Hungarian government didn&#8217;t reply to a request for comment. Pfizer and EPPO declined to comment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The message revived old grudges against his legal nemeses.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Former President Donald Trump’s Easter Sunday message on Truth Social consisted of seven words about Easter and 161 complaining about the legal system and various enemies of his.</p>



<p><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112191452263257064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The all-caps message</a>&nbsp;began “HAPPY EASTER TO ALL” and ended “HAPPY EASTER EVERYONE!” but it otherwise consisted of attacks on those leading the legal cases against him, including Special Counsel Jack Smith, Fulton County (Ga.) District Attorney Fani Willis (whom he brands as “MRS. FANI “FAUNI” WADE) and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, with a secondary swipe at President Joe Biden and the Justice Department.</p>



<p>Descriptive words in the message include “EVIL,” “SICK” (which appears in quotes), “DERANGED” (also in quotes), “CORRUPT,” and “CROOKED,” which shows up twice. The post also includes “ILLEGAL” and “ILLEGALLY.”</p>



<p>Trump has been indicted on 91 charges in various cases, though he has yet to be convicted on any of them.</p>



<p>The post was not unusual for a holiday greeting from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. His posts last year on Christmas Eve and Christmas covered similar terrain with one ending “IT’S CALLED ELECTION INTERFERENCE. MERRY CHRISTMAS!” Another message concluded: “MAY THEY ROT IN HELL. AGAIN, MERRY CHRISTMAS!”</p>



<p>Trump’s jam-packed TruthSocial feed Sunday also included derogatory material about Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), who is set to retire from the House in April, as well as Judge Arthur F. Engoron and Judge Juan Merchan — and Merchan’s daughter. There were also polling stories and a photo of him receiving a golf trophy from Jack Nicklaus, winner of 18 major championships and perhaps the most accomplished golfer of all time. Trump boasted last week that he had won championships at his club in West Palm Beach, Florida.</p>



<p>In contrast, Biden posted Sunday: “Jill and I send our warmest wishes to Christians around the world celebrating Easter Sunday. Easter reminds us of the power of hope and the promise of Christ’s Resurrection.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/31/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-easter-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Biden’s message ended</a>: “From our family to yours, happy Easter and may God bless you.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In short — and let me be blunt — if governments aren’t prepared, or are unwilling, to turn words into action, the entire strategy will be useless.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Rabbi Menachem Margolin is the chairman of the European Jewish Association, which represents hundreds of Jewish Communities across the Continent.</em></p>



<p>Part of my job as a rabbi is to inspire, to show my fellow Jews beauty in the seemingly mundane. It is to rally, lead and keep the flame of Judaism alight — a flame that’s endured for thousands of years despite repeated efforts to extinguish it.</p>



<p>But with reported or documented cases of antisemitism through the roof since the Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel — in <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/spains-jewish-community-denounces-the-biggest-increase-in-anti-semitism/" target="_blank">Spain</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2024/01/25/anti-semitic-acts-in-france-quadrupled-in-2023_6463787_7.html" target="_blank">France</a> <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/london-police-report-1353-rise-in-antisemitic-hate-crimes-since-hamas-onslaught/amp/" target="_blank">and the U.K.</a>, the rise is over 1,000 percent<strong> </strong>— my role has become even more challenging, to say the least.</p>



<p>“Never again.” Everybody knows these words. But what exactly do they mean? No more concentration camps? No more mass murder? One would certainly hope so.</p>



<p>And what about never allowing the circumstances that led to Nazi barbarity happen again? Does “never again” mean that too? The Jewish communities across Europe certainly hope so.</p>



<p>But it appears we’re laboring under misapprehension.</p>



<p>Back in 2021, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic and a worrying rise in antisemitism across the Continent, <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/combating-antisemitism/eu-strategy-combating-antisemitism-and-fostering-jewish-life-2021-2030_en" target="_blank">the European Commission published a detailed strategy for combating antisemitism</a>. The strategy was handed to member countries, which, in turn, were to adopt measures and develop national plans — and many did. A great many also signed up to <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/combating-antisemitism/definition-antisemitism_en" target="_blank">the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism</a>, patting themselves on the back for doing so.</p>



<p>Of course, we welcomed this.</p>



<p>But any strategy must ultimately pass a “real-world” test. So, how have these strategies and plans held up in the post-Oct. 7 landscape?</p>



<p>Earlier this year in the Netherlands, Holocaust Memorial Day events at universities were cancelled due to security worries and vociferous opposition to memorialization. And just recently in Amsterdam, there were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/10/amsterdam-holocaust-museum-an-overdue-reckoning-with-history" target="_blank">protests at the opening of a new Holocaust Museum</a>.</p>



<p>Across many the Continent’s capitals — and it must be said, mainly in those with significant Muslim populations — there are now regularly occurring protests where one can see Nazi images referring to Jews and images drawing parallels between Gaza and Auschwitz; one can hear calls for Jewish genocide and ethnic cleansing “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFb-FfPwMgI" target="_blank">from the river to the sea</a>.”</p>



<p>Across Europe, one can find placards calling Jews terrorists; the blood libel of child killers is used regularly; death threats against rabbis are common; Jews are insulted on the street daily; and our children are cursed at. Europeans who have served in the Israel Defense Forces are outed in their communities via letter campaigns, saying a “child killer” is living next door to them. Flights arriving from Israel are tracked and met by protesters, and the Jewish Community President in Porto takes his child to nursery wearing a bullet proof vest.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,height=768,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/30/GettyImages-2105322312.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4519773"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Posters from the &#8220;We will survive&#8221; collective pasted on a wall on Chaussee d&#8217;Antin street in the 9th arrondissement with slogans repeating anti-Semitic prejudices such as &#8220;they say the Jews control the world and you?&#8221; or &#8220;they say the Jews are rich and you?&#8221;, in Paris | Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>These are just a few of the many, many examples of daily life for Jews in Europe today. And they answer any questions regarding the worth of all the plans and strategies that were put in place.</p>



<p>Regrettably, these measures currently have no visible or demonstrable practical application across Europe. Or, as one Dutch Jewish community president put it: “They aren’t worth the paper they’re printed on.”</p>



<p>So, what’s happening in the real world? Police departments are hamstrung in the face of openly antisemitic protests, unsure, and therefore unable, to stop public manifestations of hate. The courts, too, seem to have little to no framework available when it comes to prosecuting the antizionists and antisemites who have made our collective Jewish life here in Europe hell.</p>



<p>The result? Jew haters are emboldened because they can act with impunity.</p>



<p>Today, the number one cost for Jewish communities is security. Jews are largely on their own, footing the bill for private security and equipment — funds that could be used for Sunday schooling, community development or holiday celebrations. I should also add here that the EU just put out a call for funding the security of Jewish institutions, but the bloc’s bureaucracy is often so cumbersome that — as one prominent rabbi put it — “it’s like asking someone to fill out a lengthy insurance form while your house is on fire.”</p>



<p>In short — and let me be blunt — if governments aren’t prepared, or are unwilling, to turn words into action, all the plans and IHRA adoptions, the entire strategy will be useless.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Olivier Véran and Nick Clegg are just two of the ex-politicians who've gone off to make the big bucks. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Who says politics is for life?</p>



<p>While some politicians cling to power as long as they can, others decide that a life of public service is not all it’s cut out to be. Sometimes, they simply retire. Other times, they find another calling.</p>



<p>We looked at a few former politicians who traded their careers and found new (sometimes lucrative) passions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Doctor Botox</strong></h3>



<p>Olivier Véran, a former French government spokesperson and ex-minister of health, <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/la-nouvelle-vie-d-olivier-veran-a-la-reconquete-des-macronistes-perdus-a-gauche-20240317" target="_blank">recently announced his next career venture</a> at the Clinique des Champs-Élysées in Paris. For Véran, who was a neurologist before turning to politics, going back to medicine is not all that surprising. What was shocking — and <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2024/03/20/la-reconversion-d-olivier-veran-de-neurologue-a-medecin-esthetique-le-symbole-est-terrible_6223030_3224.html" target="_blank">caused some uproar</a> in the medical community — was his decision to join a high-end clinic specializing in cosmetic medicine and surgery. Véran was quick to defend his choice, saying he won’t perform cosmetic surgery procedures, focusing instead on aesthetic medicine. “I won&#8217;t touch penises or buttocks, and I&#8217;ll be very far from breast implants,&#8221; <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/je-serai-tres-loin-des-protheses-mammaires-veran-s-explique-sur-sa-reconversion-dans-la-medecine-esthetique-20240321" target="_blank">he promised.</a> That didn&#8217;t stop <a href="https://www.lepoint.fr/sante/olivier-veran-se-reconvertit-dans-la-chirurgie-esthetique-21-03-2024-2555628_40.php" target="_blank">Le Point</a> from christening him &#8220;Doctor Botox.&#8221; </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Facebook flack</h3>



<p>Former U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has found a niche — and the big bucks — in Silicon Valley. As president of global affairs at  Meta, he handles the company&#8217;s relationships with governments, a thankless task in an era when Facebook has become synonymous with political disinformation. In 2021, the Guardian dubbed him the &#8220;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/14/insufficient-very-defensive-how-nick-clegg-became-fall-guy-facebook-failures" target="_blank">fall guy</a>&#8221; for the company&#8217;s troubles.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Honey, honey</strong></h3>



<p>A former French economy minister, socialist Arnaud Montebourg got creative with his post-politics endeavors. After resigning in 2014 and trying — <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/29/europe/french-elections-hamon-valls/index.html" target="_blank">without success</a> — to win the Socialist nomination for the presidential election in 2017, Montebourg turned to … honey. In 2018, he founded <a href="https://www.bleu-blanc-ruche.fr/" target="_blank">“Bleu, Blanc, Ruche”</a> (“Blue, White, Beehive”), a company that produces and sells 100 percent French-made honey while focusing on bee repopulation. And he’s seemingly pretty good at it: <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/entreprises/fondateur-de-bleu-blanc-ruche-arnaud-montebourg-remporte-un-prix-au-salon-du-made-in-france_AV-202111120409.html" target="_blank">He won the environment prize</a> at the 2021 &#8220;Made in France&#8221; exhibition.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Welcome to Hollywood</h3>



<p>Former U.S. President Barack Obama has been raking in cash thanks to lucrative speaking engagement that command <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/barack-obama-speeches-fee-wall-street-latest-a7954156.html" target="_blank">fees of up to €370,000 per speech</a>. He signed a multimillion dollar book deal for his memoir &#8220;A Promised Land,&#8221; which became an international bestseller. Together with his wife, former First Lady Michelle Obama, he also launched a movie production company in 2018, which has produced content for Netflix, and a podcast in an exclusive partnership with Spotify. Those ventures have allowed the Obamas to live a very comfortable lifestyle — especially considering Obama already gets a €200,000 annual pension that is allotted to former presidents. However, Obama&#8217;s exorbitant speech fees have come under fire from both political allies and opponents. To quote Senator Bernie Sanders: &#8220;It just does not look good.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Russian oil guru</h3>



<p>Once lauded for refusing to join the U.S. in the Iraq war and reducing unemployment in Germany, former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder has since <a href="https://praxistipps.focus.de/gerhard-schroeders-vermoegen-so-reich-ist-ist-der-ex-kanzler_161942" target="_blank">earned millions</a> promoting Russian energy interests. He&#8217;s had a close relationship with Vladimir Putin for years, and the Russian leader even invited<a href="https://www.stern.de/politik/ausland/wladimir-putin--sein-weg-von-der--motte--zu-putin--dem-ewigen-_32518466-31799106.html" target="_blank"> Schröder on a sleigh ride through Russian forests </a>on Orthodox Christmas in 2001. So, it wasn’t much of a surprise when Schröder joined the shareholder committee of the Russian-controlled Nord Stream company, reportedly earning about €250,000 a year. From 2017, he presided over the board of the Russian oil company Rosneft until <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/gerhard-schroder-to-leave-rosneft/">he stepped down</a> in May 2022 after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A lobbyist, duh</h3>



<p>Once a rising star in conservative Europe, Sebastian Kurz became Austria’s youngest chancellor at the age of 31 in 2017. His four years in power were marked by <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/the-house-of-sebastian-kurz-scandal-explained-austria-chancellor-perjury-allegations/">scandals and corruption allegations</a>, and now he is working as a lobbyist for <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/09/20/peter-thiel-book-facebook-trump-jd-vance-blake-masters-josh-hawley-513121" target="_blank">American tech billionaire Peter Thiel</a> — a co-founder of Paypal and <a href="https://www.nzz.ch/international/midterms-der-investor-peter-thiel-unterstuetzt-trumps-kandidaten-ld.1706059" target="_blank">onetime supporter of former U.S. President Donald Trump</a> — reportedly <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/austria-former-chancellor-sebastian-kurz-palantir-technologies-silicon-valley-peter-thiel/">earning €300,000 </a>a year. Kurz also founded a startup with Shalev Hulio, the Israeli inventor of the controversial spyware Pegasus. In February, Kurz was found <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/sebastian-kurz-charged-on-suspicion-of-making-false-statements/">guilty of perjury</a>, damaging his chances of a return to politics — something he might not be keen on anyway, considering the negative impact it might have on his more lucrative projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For some people, one career is not enough — they have to try them all. That seems to be the case for former U.K. Chancellor George Osborne, who since leaving politics in 2017 has beefed up his resume by working a slew of positions in<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/george-osborne-eighth-job/"> various industries</a>. Over the past seven years, he has been editor of London’s Evening Standard, an adviser to BlackRock (a post that earns him £650,000 a year), chairman of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/jun/24/ex-chancellor-george-osborne-appointed-chair-british-museum" target="_blank">chairman of the British Museum</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/feb/01/former-chancellor-george-osborne-to-become-full-time-banker" target="_blank">partner</a> at the investment bank Robey Warshaw.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A higher calling</strong></h3>



<p>Here&#8217;s one from the other end of the salary scale. Former British minister Jonathan Aitken’s political career came to an abrupt end when he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/03/jonathan-aitken-to-be-ordained-as-a-deacon" target="_blank">went to prison for perjury </a>in 1999 after his libel case against the Guardian collapsed. But during those seven months behind bars, Aitken joined a prayer group started by an Irish burglar, became a Christian and found his calling: God. After leaving prison, Aitken obtained a degree in theology at the University of Oxford. And in 2018, he was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44668185" target="_blank">ordained as a deacon</a> and eventually became a prison chaplain.</p>
