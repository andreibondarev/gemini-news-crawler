					<description><![CDATA[Schlein, secretary of the center-left Democratic Party, has railed against the prime minister for her politics.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Italy&#8217;s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who leads the right-wing Brothers of Italy party, will face Italian opposition leader Elly Schlein in a televised debate on May 23 ahead of the European Parliament election. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/giorgia-meloni-european-election-2024-italy-prime-minister/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/giorgia-meloni-european-election-2024-italy-prime-minister/">long-awaited confrontation</a> is set to take place on the television show &#8220;Porta a Porta&#8221; hosted by&nbsp;Bruno Vespa on Rai1, Italian media <a href="https://www.theitaliantimes.it/2024/05/11/meloni-schlein-confronto-tv-rai-1-porta-porta-quando-dove/" target="_blank">reported</a> on Saturday. The candidates are expected to discuss key policy areas including employment, health and migration. </p>



<p>Schlein, secretary of the center-left Democratic Party, has been vocal against Meloni for her politics, including her proposal to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/melonis-dangerous-constitutional-change-in-italy/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/melonis-dangerous-constitutional-change-in-italy/">change the Italian constitution</a> to allow citizens to directly vote for the prime minister, which Schlein describes as a &#8220;a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/eu-election-debate/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/eu-election-debate/">botched and dangerous reform</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meloni <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/179200" target="_blank">announced</a> she would be running in the European elections last month, with the ambition to create a majority that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0JYqstzOiI&amp;t=1s" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0JYqstzOiI&amp;t=1s" target="_blank">&#8220;brings together the center-right forces&#8221;</a> and to &#8220;send the left <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-epp-ursula-von-der-leyen-conservatives-european-election/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-epp-ursula-von-der-leyen-conservatives-european-election/">into the opposition</a> even in the EU,&#8221; she said at a party event in Pescara, Italy.</p>



<p>Her party already&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.adnkronos.com/politica/europee-sondaggio-fratelli-ditalia-si-conferma-primo-partito-con-il-27-2-pd-sale-al-20-3_1XYCZrNqXqvbi4uM4v28bB" target="_blank">tops recent polls</a>&nbsp;in Italy, and is predicted to get 27.2 percent of the vote, ahead of the Democratic Party (20.3 percent) and the Five Stars Movement (16.8 percent).</p>



<p>The Brothers of Italy party is part of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, which <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/von-der-leyen-hard-right-maastricht-debate-giorgia-meloni-viktor-orban-schmit/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/von-der-leyen-hard-right-maastricht-debate-giorgia-meloni-viktor-orban-schmit/">could become part of a coalition</a> with the European People&#8217;s Party (EPP) as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/179270" target="_blank">hinted</a> during the Maastricht debate late last month. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk says the country faces a "hybrid war" in illegal migration.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Poland will strengthen its eastern border infrastructure to deter migrants entering from Belarus, as the number of illegal crossing attempts increases. </p>



<p>Tusk said that Poland is facing a &#8220;hybrid war&#8221; in illegal migration from Belarus, as he visited the village fo Karakule on the border to meet with troops, according to the <a href="https://www.pap.pl/en/news/poland-faces-escalating-hybrid-war-tusk-says-poland-belarus-border" target="_blank">Polish Press Agency</a>. &#8220;There will be no limit of funds when it comes to the the security of Poland,&#8221; he said. </p>



<p>The prime minister reaffirmed his belief that Alexander Lukashenko&#8217;s regime in Belarus is &#8220;co-organizing this practice&#8221; as the country has been demonstrating increasingly aggressive intentions towards Poland. In 2021, Poland accused Belarus of letting in thousands of <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/british-troops-deployed-to-help-poland-guard-its-border-with-belarus/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/british-troops-deployed-to-help-poland-guard-its-border-with-belarus/">undocumented migrants</a> through the border into the European Union, accusations that Belarus denies. </p>



<p>Tusk on Saturday said the bolstered fortifications would be along the &#8220;entire eastern border,&#8221; which could also include Ukraine and Russia. He gave no details on the planning.</p>



<p>Belarus has also come under fire recently for its customs union with Russia. On Monday, the European Commission called for sweeping trade sanctions against Belarus, saying that concerns over food security should not be used as an argument to give Moscow’s closest ally any exceptions, <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/179546" target="_blank">according to a proposal seen by POLITICO</a>.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, a high-level Polish judge <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-judge-asks-for-asylum-in-belarus-protest-against-unjust-policy-towards-russia/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-judge-asks-for-asylum-in-belarus-protest-against-unjust-policy-towards-russia/">sought political asylum</a> in Belarus, saying the move was in “protest against Poland’s unjust and harmful policy” toward Belarus and Russia.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The decision follows a police investigation into a formal complaint by a female member of the production crew. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> Joost Klein, the Dutch candidate in the Eurovision song contest, has been banned from the competition&#8217;s final taking place tonight in Malmö, Sweden, following a formal complaint by a female member of the production crew.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The Dutch artist Joost Klein will not be competing in the Grand Final of this year’s Eurovision Song Contest,&#8221; the event’s organizer, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), said in <a href="https://eurovision.tv/mediacentre/release/statement-dutch-participation-eurovision-song-contest" target="_blank">a statement</a> Saturday. The decision follows an investigation by Swedish police into the woman&#8217;s complaint, which was made &#8220;after an incident following his performance in Thursday night’s Semi Final,&#8221; according to the statement.</p>



<p>&#8220;While the legal process takes its course, it would not be appropriate for him to continue in the contest,&#8221; the EBU said.</p>



<p>The case has now been passed to a prosecutor, the Swedish press <a href="http://According to information to Swedish broadcaster SVT, a physical confrontation has occurred between the Dutch artist Joost Klein and a photographer." target="_blank">reported</a>. The complaint accuses Klein of making threats, according to the reports. Further details were unavailable. </p>



<p>Reports of a possible &#8220;incident&#8221; concerning <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/dutch-eurosong-entry-turns-political-timmermans-links-eu-successes/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/dutch-eurosong-entry-turns-political-timmermans-links-eu-successes/">the singer</a> circulated on Friday after Klein was unexpectedly banned from taking his turn during the second dress rehearsal, even though he attended the traditional &#8220;flag parade&#8221; at the beginning of the competition. </p>



<p>Confusion over the matter prompted the EBU  to issue a statement on Friday saying that it was &#8220;currently investigating an incident &#8230; involving the Dutch artist.&#8221;</p>



<p>A spokesperson from the Swedish police confirmed that a man is suspected of unlawful threats at Malmö Arena on Thursday evening, <a href="https://www.svt.se/kultur/incident-utreds-kring-nederlandske-artisten-joost-klein" target="_blank">according to Swedish media outlet SVT Nyheter</a>. </p>



<p>Speculation that the investigation had something to do with the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-eurovision-song-contest-hamas-war-finland-sweden/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-eurovision-song-contest-hamas-war-finland-sweden/">Israeli participant Eden Golan</a> grew after a tense exchange between the two performers during a Eurovision press conference on Thursday evening.  </p>



<p>Asked if her participation in the song contest presented a security risk to others in the show given that her presence, song and recent qualification for the semi-final had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/may/09/israel-qualifies-eurovision-song-contest-final-protests" target="_blank">sparked fierce protests</a> in Malmö, a representative of the EBU told Golan she didn&#8217;t have to answer but Klein shouted back asking &#8220;Why not?&#8221; </p>



<p>In its statement on Saturday, the EBU said that &#8220;<a href="https://eurovision.tv/mediacentre/release/statement-dutch-participation-eurovision-song-contest" data-type="link" data-id="https://eurovision.tv/mediacentre/release/statement-dutch-participation-eurovision-song-contest" target="_blank">contrary to some media reports</a> and social media speculation, this incident did not involve any other performer or delegation member.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to the Eurovision <a href="https://eurovisionworld.com/esc/the-netherlands-joost-klein-not-rehearsing-until-further-notice" target="_blank">website</a>, the &#8220;Rest of the World&#8221; vote — which allows people in non-participating countries to vote — has been postponed until the &#8220;ongoing investigation regarding the Dutch participant has been concluded.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Israel&#8217;s Golan earlier <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/defying-haters-israels-eden-golan-advances-to-the-eurovision-grand-final-on-saturday/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.timesofisrael.com/defying-haters-israels-eden-golan-advances-to-the-eurovision-grand-final-on-saturday/" target="_blank">qualified for the Eurovision final</a> hours after thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in the streets of Malmö to show their support for Gaza. After Golan had been booed during dress rehearsals, there was a mixture of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg67w7gdqvqo" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg67w7gdqvqo" target="_blank">cheering and booing</a> again during Thursday&#8217;s semi-final.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Israeli army plans to "work with great force" against Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces said. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Israel Defense Forces told people in parts of Rafah and in the city of Jabalia to leave &#8220;immediately&#8221; Saturday morning, as Israel prepares to expand its military operation in the Gaza Strip. </p>



<p>The Israeli army plans to &#8220;work with great force&#8221; against the Hamas militant group,  Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Avichai Adraee said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1789171670105636971" data-type="link" data-id="https://twitter.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1789171670105636971" target="_blank">post on X</a>, calling the areas to be evacuated a &#8220;dangerous combat zone.&#8221;</p>



<p>The evacuation order covers the southeastern part of Rafah along the Israeli border and the Egyptian border — including <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/08/israel-rafah-scott-anderson-unrwa-00156924" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/08/israel-rafah-scott-anderson-unrwa-00156924" target="_blank">the Rafah crossing</a>, which the Israeli military blocked on Tuesday. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1789224467165503733" data-type="link" data-id="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1789224467165503733" target="_blank">IDF statement</a>, Hamas has been &#8220;trying to rebuild its capabilities in the region.&#8221;</p>



<p>People were told to go to a humanitarian zone in Al-Mawasi in the western part of the Gaza Strip, where more than 400,000 people have sought refuge, according to the <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-106-situation-gaza-strip-and-west-bank-including-east-Jerusalem" target="_blank">latest situation report</a> from the U.N.&#8217;s Palestinian humanitarian agency UNRWA. </p>



<p>But the humanitarian camp cannot house any more people, the agency said, as about 80,000 people have already fled Rafah and moved to the area since the Israeli army issued its first evacuation order on Monday. </p>



<p>The evacuation orders come as a much-anticipated U.S. State Department report on the Israel-Hamas conflict stopped short of declaring that Israel has violated international law in its war with the militant group. </p>



<p>“It is reasonable to assess” that Israel used U.S.-provided weapons in ways that are “inconsistent” with international law, the report states. But Israel didn’t give Washington enough evidence to adjudicate whether those arms were used to violate human rights in Gaza, the West Bank or East Jerusalem, according to the document.</p>



<p>On Friday, the U.N. General Assembly voted to grant new <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/10/un-assembly-palestine-membership-resolution-00157391" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/10/un-assembly-palestine-membership-resolution-00157391" target="_blank">“rights and privileges” to Palestine</a> and called on the Security Council to reconsider Palestine’s request to become the 194th member of the U.N. The 193-member world body approved the resolution by a vote of 143-9 with 25 abstentions. The United States voted against the resolution, along with Israel, Argentina, Czechia, Hungary, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Papua New Guinea.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s the first time crypto has become an issue in the general election of a presidential race.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Donald Trump is making presidential history all over again: He’s poised to be the first major party nominee to court cryptocurrency traders. It’s leaving some Democrats feeling uneasy.</p>



<p>Trump told crypto backers at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday that they “better vote” for him because of the way the Biden administration has unleashed a regulatory crackdown on the industry.</p>



<p>“They are against it,” he said at an event promoting his own non-fungible token, or NFT.</p>



<p>Trump’s overt play for the crypto faithful is a big shift from the criticism he dished out in his first term, but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/08/donald-trump-crypto-savior-00132417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s not unexpected</a>. The GOP has become increasingly friendly toward bitcoin and other digital assets in recent years, while key Democrats remain at odds over whether to grant the industry legitimacy after a series of scandals. Trump’s direct embrace is a landmark moment for crypto firms that have undertaken an intense Washington lobbying effort and are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/18/crypto-firms-investors-78m-super-pacs-00132199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spending tens of millions of dollars</a>&nbsp;to influence the 2024 elections.</p>



<p>“President Trump’s remarks signal a sea change in the importance of digital assets this election cycle,” said Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, a top crypto industry lobbying group.</p>



<p>The issue is giving Trump a fresh line of attack on Biden. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, a Biden nominee, has pursued an extensive series of enforcement actions against crypto firms that he says are flouting federal securities laws. The White House on Wednesday angered crypto advocates when it threatened to veto bipartisan&nbsp;House legislation&nbsp;that would undo SEC guidelines the industry hates.</p>



<p>“Gensler is very much against it,” Trump said Wednesday of the administration’s approach to crypto. “The Democrats are very much against it.”</p>



<p>Not all Democrats are against it. Twenty-one Democrats on Wednesday defied Biden’s veto threat and joined with Republicans in voting for a resolution&nbsp;to overturn SEC crypto guidance. Trump’s embrace could add a new partisan tinge to the debate over crypto regulation — a risk for the industry, which is courting both sides.</p>



<p>Following Trump’s comments, Rep.&nbsp;Wiley Nickel, a pro-crypto North Carolina Democrat,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/wileynickel/status/1788608778843074658?s=46" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>&nbsp;that his party “cannot hand this issue to the Republicans.” But key Democrats like Sen.&nbsp;Elizabeth Warren&nbsp;(D-Mass.) have stood in the way of industry-friendly policies while warning of risks to consumers and the financial system, as well as crypto’s role in financial crime.</p>



<p>It’s unclear, though, whether courting digital asset traders can win a significant number of votes. A Pew Research Center Survey&nbsp;released last year&nbsp;found that most Americans weren’t confident in crypto’s safety or reliability. The industry has suffered major blowups in the last few years, including the implosion of the FTX exchange in a huge fraud scandal and the U.S. government’s $4.4 billion settlement with the Binance exchange over allegations that it facilitated financial crimes.</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://theblockchainassociation.org/swingstatevoter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poll released by crypto industry groups</a>&nbsp;this week showed that more than 20 percent of voters in six key swing states identify crypto as a major issue.&nbsp;<a href="https://policy.paradigm.xyz/writing/March-2024-Polling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A separate nationwide survey</a>&nbsp;of registered voters commissioned by the crypto firm Paradigm found that crypto ownership is higher among communities of color and young people — key constituencies that helped boost Biden in 2020 but are now proving to be challenging for him to win over.</p>



<p>Crypto has gained support from politicians on the right who tout it as an alternative to the mainstream financial system. The Paradigm poll found earlier this year that crypto owners favor Trump over Biden, 48 percent to 39 percent, with 13 percent undecided.</p>



<p>“President Trump understands freedom and liberty, he knows that innovation needs to be protected here in America and he knows that the role government should play is to make sure we create an environment in which innovation grows and prospers,” said Ohio GOP Senate candidate Bernie Moreno, a longtime crypto booster. “That’s why it’s no surprise to see him making those comments about crypto.”</p>



<p>Former Republican presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy, who is seen as a potential cabinet official in a second Trump administration, championed crypto during the GOP primary and helped push the former president to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/18/trump-vows-to-block-any-fed-effort-to-launch-digital-currency-00136328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">come out against the adoption of a government-backed central bank digital currency</a>. Crypto firms also oppose a potential Federal Reserve digital currency, and conservatives warn it’s a threat to privacy.</p>



<p>“I was impressed with President Trump’s ability to dive deep into a subject area that was newer to him,” Ramaswamy said in an interview last month.</p>



<p>Ramaswamy declined to comment on whether he hopes to work on crypto policy in a second Trump administration, saying he is “focused on winning the election.”</p>



<p>Trump’s support for digital assets wasn’t always a given. He&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/11/trump-attacks-facebooks-libra-currency-1411914" target="_blank">derided crypto on social media</a>&nbsp;during his presidency, and key cabinet members&nbsp;took a skeptical approach to the industry. Trump’s SEC chair initiated major litigation against a prominent crypto firm.</p>



<p>But Trump has gone on to dabble in crypto since leaving office. He has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/minutes/congress/12-15-2022/donald-trump-nft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued his own NFT</a>, and as of last August he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/16/trump-owns-even-more-crypto-than-first-known-new-documents-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">owned $2.8 million in a crypto wallet</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s pretty remarkable to see, in the few years since he’s left office, the 180 that he has done on crypto,” said Cody Carbone, chief policy officer at the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a crypto advocacy group. “It’s pretty great to see him come out and be supportive of the industry.”</p>



<p>Trump’s embrace of crypto carries potential risks. Digital asset markets have experienced dramatic booms and busts in recent years, and key industry players like Sam Bankman-Fried have been sentenced to prison time for breaking the law.</p>



<p>The shift also carries risk for Washington’s crypto lobby. Trump could make the politics of digital asset regulation even more partisan moving forward. The industry has spent years — as well as millions of dollars in campaign contributions — trying to build support in both parties, which will likely be key to enacting legislation that crypto firms want.</p>



<p>“I don’t want this to become a partisan issue,” Carbone said. “I think this presents an opportunity for Democrats to start to really have an introspective look and educate themselves on the benefits of digital assets.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A new State Department report, criticized as inconclusive, drew immediate fire from both progressive Democrats and Republicans.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Biden administration once again pulled its punches when it comes to Israel.</p>



<p>Despite pressure from Democratic lawmakers and his efforts to stop a major Israeli ground operation in Rafah, President Joe Biden did not use a much-anticipated report on Friday to declare that Israel has violated international law in its war with Hamas. Instead, the State Department document, mandated by a Biden-backed review policy, punted on one of the most controversial issues in the president’s support for Israel.</p>



<p>“It is reasonable to assess” that Israel used American-provided weapons in ways that are “inconsistent” with international law, per the report obtained by POLITICO. It goes on to say that Israel didn’t give the U.S. enough evidence to adjudicate whether those arms were used to violate human rights in Gaza, the West Bank or East Jerusalem.</p>



<p>There have been “sufficient reported incidents to raise serious concerns,” the report continues, flipping between criticism of Israel’s conduct without explicitly calling it out for human rights violations.</p>



<p>Put together, the U.S. offered fodder for both critics and supporters of Israel. There was a whiff of accountability but ultimately no greater reprimand, allowing the Biden administration to continue sending weapons to Israel as it fights Hamas while gingerly appeasing vocal critics. The findings could also be used as a precedent to keep supplying Israel with arms, so long as not enough evidence is produced to clearly prove violations of international law were committed with American weaponry.</p>



<p>The Biden administration promised months ago to issue the report amid growing pressure from Democrats. The goal of the report was to review whether American-provided weapons are being used in conflicts in ways that violate international laws.</p>



<p>The document&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/israel-gaza-state-report-00156619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was originally slated to be released Wednesday</a>, but it was updated right up until it was sent to lawmakers on Friday.</p>



<p>Tensions have been mounting since Biden&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/inside-bidens-public-ultimatum/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to pause a shipment of weapons to Israel containing thousands</a>&nbsp;of warheads over concern about Israel’s plans to invade Rafah without a credible plan to protect civilians. In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Biden threatened to halt additional weapons sales if Israel launches a major ground operation in the southern Gaza city.</p>



<p>But Israel is already conducting operations in Rafah, where more than a million civilians are sheltering.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/08/world/middleeast/israel-incursion-rafah-satellite-image-map.html" target="_blank">Satellite imagery</a>&nbsp;indicates the Israeli forces have already moved beyond the Rafah crossing and into the main area of the city. Biden also recently acknowledged that U.S.-made bombs had killed civilians in the conflict.</p>



<p>The new report has already incensed many members of Congress, especially Republicans who saw it as harsh and unnecessary.</p>



<p>“The administration has given Israel a politically damaging assessment while publicly announcing it is withholding a select set of precision weapons,” Idaho’s Jim Risch, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s ranking member. He added that the president and his administration are “attempting to placate voters on the far left at the expense of a close ally in the midst of its justified war with Hamas terrorists.”</p>



<p>The findings also were outraging to Democratic lawmakers, human rights activists and leaders of non-governmental organizations who say the U.S. cannot keep assisting Israel as it bombards Gaza to root out Hamas militants.</p>



<p>Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), a leading critic of Israel’s conduct in the war, said the administration fell “far short” of its difficult mandate. “It fails to do the hard work of making the assessment and ducks the ultimate questions,” he told reporters Friday evening.</p>



<p>“They are staring at all these trees yet concluding that there’s no forest. It reads like a factual analysis and a politicized conclusion,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International.</p>



<p>“It is clear that Israel is violating international law and obstructing aid into Gaza. In turning a blind eye, the administration is allowing Israel to continue to do so without consequence,” said Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America.</p>



<p>The war began Oct. 7 after Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 others hostage in Gaza. But Israel’s overwhelming response has left some 35,000 Palestinians dead, according to Hamas-controlled Gazan health authorities who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p>



<p>Israel insists that it is following the laws of war and principles of humanitarian aid while doing its best to minimize civilian casualties, even though Hamas militants have embedded themselves and their arsenal within Gaza’s civilian population.</p>



<p>Still, there have been cases where Israeli actions in this war have infuriated U.S. officials. This includes imposing severe restrictions on humanitarian aid allowed to flow into Gaza — where U.S. officials say&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/11/politics/samantha-power-famine-gaza/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">famine has started to take root</a>&nbsp;— as well as an Israeli airstrike that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/02/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-death-of-world-central-kitchen-workers-in-gaza/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killed seven World Central Kitchen workers&nbsp;</a>last month.</p>



<p>White House spokesperson John Kirby declined to confirm the report’s contents earlier on Friday.</p>



<p>“We make clear to any ally or partner who is receiving U.S. military assistance, … make sure they understand our expectations for how those weapons are going to be used in the battlefield,” Kirby said.</p>



<p>Asked by POLITICO if the administration purposefully tried to bury the report right before the weekend, Kirby replied: “The eventual submission of this report is based on the speed work that had to get done to get it ready and not some nefarious effort to make it harder for you guys to report on it.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Journalists warn new populist prime minister is trying to sideline those in the media he disagrees with.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In Slovakia, Robert Fico&#8217;s government has shunned the independent press and wants to remake the public broadcaster into a state-run TV channel that could soon be run by a flat-earther.  </p>



<p>The government&#8217;s goal? Bring the media to heel.</p>



<p>Since winning a Sept. 30 general election, Fico and his coalition allies have dismayed Brussels by <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/threat-judge-journalist-slovakia-spiral-eastward-robert-fico/">seeming to lurch</a> toward the governance style of Hungary&#8217;s strongman prime minister, Viktor Orbán, including by <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/slovak-law-change-complicates-corruption-rape-prosecutions/">abolishing a key anti-corruption office</a>, halting <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/in-post-election-reversal-slovakia-enables-weapons-exports-to-ukrainef-fico/">state military support</a> to Ukraine, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/czechs-burn-bridge-with-moscow-boosting-slovaks/">parroting Moscow talking points</a>, and now attempting to subjugate public media in an attempt to give the coalition even greater control. That&#8217;s triggered concerns in Brussels about media freedom and civil liberties in another European Union country. </p>



<p>Fico&#8217;s government on April 24 approved a controversial proposal to scrap public broadcaster RTVS and replace it with what free-speech advocates fear could be a mouthpiece for the ruling coalition. Fico has long criticized RTVS as not being &#8220;<a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/tato-televize-uz-neni-objektivni-rekl-fico-o-rtvs-zakon-o-jeji-promene-projedna_2404221326_tkz" target="_blank">objective enough.</a>&#8220;</p>



<p>The plan is expected to be approved by the country’s parliament in June.</p>



<p>The government&#8217;s replacement for RTVS — Slovak Television and Radio (STVR) — will be a “state institution,” which under Slovak law gives the coalition greater control over the hiring of its general director and board of directors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/06/GettyImages-954686136-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4704501" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/06/GettyImages-954686136.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/06/GettyImages-954686136.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">“Such threats risk undermining democracy, access to impartial news, and public debate in Slovakia,” EBU’s press office told POLITICO in a statement. | Vladimir Simicek/ AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>The current RTVS boss, Ľuboš Machaj, will be dismissed and one of the candidates to replace him is Lukáš Machala, who recently <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/zeme-kulata-placata-slovensko-lukas-machala-rtvs_2404301446_ako" target="_blank">disputed</a> whether the Earth is round.</p>



<p>&#8220;[Public] television and radio were unable to be objective because they were in a conflict with the Slovak government,&#8221; Fico <a href="http://Televize a rozhlas objektivně nemohou být objektivní, protože jsou ve sporu s vládou Slovenské republiky. Je porušováno základní lidské právo občanů Slovenské republiky na to, aby měli k dispozici objektivní informace" target="_blank">explained</a>. &#8220;It was a violation of the basic right of Slovak citizens to objective information.&#8221;</p>



<p>But academics and independent experts dispute that claim. </p>



<p>“We can say goodbye to any type of public service, objectivity … we are really heading to the point where [STVR] will become [the] government’s mouthpiece, maybe even propaganda tool,” said political scientist Peter Dubóczi, who is also a media expert with Adapt Institute, a think tank.</p>



<p>The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) —&nbsp;which brings together media organizations from across the continent —&nbsp;said it was “concerned” that the draft law “effectively replaces a respected public service broadcaster and could threaten the independence of public service broadcasting.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Such threats risk undermining democracy, access to impartial news, and public debate in Slovakia,” EBU’s press office told POLITICO in a statement.</p>



<p>The initial proposal to shake up the public broadcaster came just weeks after the EU <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-lawmakers-adopt-media-freedom-law/">adopted</a> its new Media Freedom Act, which is designed to shield newsrooms from political influence and support media pluralism. The Slovak government subsequently modified its draft law to comply with the act.</p>



<p>According to Dubóczi the political scientist, the modified draft conforms with the act “on paper” but not “within democratic legacy.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Resilient but rattled </strong></h3>



<p>In an act of protest, many Slovak journalists <a href="https://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/pracovnici-a-priznivci-rtvs-prisli-do-prace-v-cernem-zakon-p/r~89804ae6031211efbb77ac1f6b220ee8/" target="_blank">wore black</a> the day after the public media overhaul was announced. But while they expressed resilience and defiance, Slovak news professionals interviewed by POLITICO also admitted to feeling under the gun.</p>



<p>Shortly after beginning his fourth term as prime minister last fall, Fico and his government <a href="https://domov.sme.sk/c/23246431/premier-prerusil-komunikaciu-s-vybranymi-mediami.html" target="_blank">ceased</a> communicating with four respected independent media outlets that he deemed “hostile,” including TV Markíza — the nation&#8217;s most-watched station, with a <a href="https://strategie.hnonline.sk/news/media/96128374-prieskum-novy-cas-expres-markiza-a-tv-max-su-stale-najpopularnejsie-slovenske-media" target="_blank">27 percent market share</a> — as well as the dailies Denník N and SME and&nbsp;the news site Aktuality.</p>



<p>Fico&#8217;s return to power has been accompanied by &#8220;an open assault on independent media,” according to Matúš Kostolný, editor-in-chief of Denník N.</p>



<p>“Since the first day after the election he has attacked journalists, calling us rats … Fico has always attacked journalists, but now he is taking an even harder line, calling us his enemies and committing the entire government to doing the same,” Kostolný said.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/06/GettyImages-926310272-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4704444" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/06/GettyImages-926310272.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/06/GettyImages-926310272.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In 2018, investigative journalist Ján Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kušnírová were murdered, | Vladimir Simicek/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>In 2018, investigative journalist Ján Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kušnírová <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/robert-fico-jan-kuciak-slovak-pm-offers-to-step-down-after-journalists-murder/">were murdered</a>, sparking the largest protests in the country since the 1989 fall of the Communist regime and leading to Fico&#8217;s resignation as PM, mid-way through his third term.</p>



<p>According to Kostolný, the tragedy has steeled Slovakia’s journalists to fight state oppression all the harder.</p>



<p>“Slovakia still has plenty of independent media and courageous journalists, but Fico is trying very hard to silence them and intimidate them,&#8221; Kostolný said. &#8220;Having had the experience we did in the 1990s under [then Prime Minister Vladimír] Mečiar, I believe we&#8217;re better prepared now than our colleagues in Hungary, for example.”</p>



<p>Under the authoritarian 1994-1998 Mečiar government, which saw Slovakia dropped from a round of NATO expansion due to democratic backsliding, multiple journalists were attacked and independent media were subjected to intimidation and economic pressure.</p>



<p>One of those targeted was Alexej Fulmek, a former war correspondent and current CEO of Petit Press, which publishes SME and 34 other national and regional titles.</p>



<p>“I expect they will attempt to change media legislation and influence the judicial process to have large fines levied on media, similar to what happened in the Mečiar era, when the powers-that-be tried to liquidate independent media through inordinate financial penalties,” Fulmek said.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/06/GettyImages-2136581671-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4704477" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/06/GettyImages-2136581671-1.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/06/GettyImages-2136581671-1.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">“Slovakia still has plenty of independent media and courageous journalists, but Fico is trying very hard to silence them and intimidate them,&#8221; Matúš Kostolný said. | Vladimir Simicek/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>Zuzana Petková, a former business journalist and current director of the Zastavme korupciu (Stop Corruption) NGO, said she has learned to live with the “constant hatred and vile comments” that are aimed at her.</p>



<p>“It’s an attempt to silence active women through hate, to get them to say that they won’t let their families suffer because of their careers. In Hungary, a number of female journalists who covered politics were silenced in this way.&nbsp;The tactic is also working in Slovakia, with some female journalists and politicians already having withdrawn from public roles,” she said.</p>



<p>One of them is Zuzana Kovačič Hanzelová, a prominent journalist who was <a href="https://plus.rozhlas.cz/na-slovensku-prestala-platit-pravidla-policie-si-me-nezakonne-lustrovala-9211774" target="_blank">attacked</a> on the street after a disinformation media portal published her home address.</p>



<p>The EU has not yet sounded the alarm about media freedom in Slovakia, although Commission Vice President Věra Jourová did visit Bratislava last month to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/bombshell-in-spain-as-pedro-sanchez-mulls-stepping-down/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/bombshell-in-spain-as-pedro-sanchez-mulls-stepping-down/">discuss</a> the government&#8217;s planned changes to public media. “EU citizens expect the EU to take strong action to protect media freedom,” Jourová said at the time.<br><br>Nor are Slovaks themselves especially concerned. A recent GLOBSEC report <a href="https://www.globsec.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/GLOBSEC%20Trends%202024.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.globsec.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/GLOBSEC%20Trends%202024.pdf" target="_blank">found</a> that 73 percent of respondents in Slovakia consider the country&#8217;s media to be &#8220;relatively or completely free.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This may be influenced by the increasing legitimisation of disinformation channels by key government figures, which might have contributed to a belief among consumers of disinformation outlets that their media is &#8216;finally&#8217; free,” the report said.</p>



<p>But many journalists disagree. Marek Vagovič, an investigative journalist for 20 years, has written six books, two of them deeply critical of Fico&#8217;s past governments.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are enormous economic pressures on Markíza and JOJ [Slovakia&#8217;s second-most watched TV station], whose owners do business with state companies and receive advertising from them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The management of Markíza and JOJ are in turn now pressuring their reporters not to cover politics so closely, not to ask difficult questions, and not to be confrontational toward the government.</p>



<p>&#8220;It makes me feel that Slovakia has gone back in time to before the murders of Ján and Martina — for all that I remain confident that the majority of us will not be deterred and will continue to report the facts with courage.&#8221; </p>

					<description><![CDATA[As the defense minister sought to assure American leaders that Germany can defend Europe, his coalition government bickered over how to pay for it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>WASHINGTON — During a trip to the U.S. this week, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius tried to convince American leaders that Germany is making good on the <em>Zeitenwende</em>, the country&#8217;s promise to radically strengthen its military following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. </p>



<p>“Germany is making national and collective defense its priority, which is a first since the Second World War,” Pistorius told a crowd at Johns Hopkins University&#8217;s School of Advanced International Studies.</p>



<p>But as Pistorius attempted to signal German resolve on questions of defense, he opened up a more mundane question that is splitting Germany’s often-fractious coalition government at home:&nbsp;How will Germany pay for it?</p>



<p>Pistorius has limited financial wiggle room to invest in Germany’s military to make it “fit for war,” as he recently put it. That is because of Germany’s so-called “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-debt-austerity-climate-olaf-scholz-christian-lindner/">debt brake</a>,” which restricts the federal deficit to 0.35&nbsp;percent&nbsp;of GDP, except in times of emergency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pistorius, a social democrat, has been campaigning to exempt defense spending from those spending rules in recent weeks — a stance he doubled down on on his U.S. trip. “Expenditure for defense and civil protection should not be included” under debt brake rules, he told the German Press Agency.</p>



<p>German Finance Minister Christian Linder, the leader of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) who is renewing attempts to brand himself as the government’s fiscal hawk, shot back at Pistorius, arguing that raising debt to finance defense spending is not the answer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="689" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/15/GettyImages-1794795984-1024x689.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3865656" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/15/GettyImages-1794795984.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/15/GettyImages-1794795984.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christian Linder argued that raising debt to finance defense spending is not the answer. | Sean Gallup/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Unfortunately, Mr. Pistorius is only singling out the option of creating security through debt,” he told the German Press Agency. “The citizens would thus be saddled with more and more permanent interest burdens,” he added. “The better way is to reallocate money in our large state budget and get the economy moving.”</p>



<p>The coalition spat over how to finance defense spending leaves open the question of how Germany will pay for the promised military expansion. That question is only becoming more urgent now that a €100 billion special <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-government-opposition-agree-100bn-defense-spending-bill/">fund</a> set aside in 2022 for boosting Germany’s military is already projected to run dry by 2028, according to Pistorius’s own estimate.</p>



<p>By Pistorius&#8217; count, Germany will need to spend around an additional €7 billion next year to maintain its defense commitments and meet the NATO defense spending target of at least 2 percent of GDP. This is the first year that Germany is projected to meet that 2 percent target, and Chancellor Olaf Scholz has vowed to continue to meet the target every year going forward.</p>



<p>There’s reason to believe many Germans are sympathetic to Pistorius’s call for more defense spending. Pistorius consistently ranks as one of Germany’s most well-liked politicians, and, according to one recent poll, 70 percent of Germans support <a href="https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/politik/deutschland/pistorius-weidel-politiker-zdf-politbarometer-100.html" target="_blank">more spending</a> for the German military, even if it means cuts to other parts of the budget.</p>



<p>While it remains unclear how Germany will pay for its defense commitments, Pistorius spent much of his time in the U.S. trying to assure American leaders that Germany is up to the task.</p>



<p>German leaders, he told Johns Hopkins University, are “aware that America&#8217;s resources and attention cannot and will not be centered on Europe” going forward. This is why, he added, Berlin is taking on “more responsibility for the security” of the European continent.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Moscow may be pushing to create new border buffer zone.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Russian forces launched an attack across the Ukrainian border north of Kharkiv, potentially aiming to open a new front in the war that has long been waged in the country&#8217;s east and south.</p>



<p>Ukraine sent reinforcements as fighting occurred along the Russian border of the region, the defense ministry said, adding that Russia had pounded the frontier town of Vovchansk with guided aerial bombs and artillery.</p>



<p>“At approximately 5 a.m., there was an attempt by the enemy to break through our defense line using armored vehicles,” the Ukrainian defense ministry shared in a <a href="https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1788892210387210743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1788892210387210743%7Ctwgr%5Eb0b50c320cbf76ab9f932cbbf93ae97cebeaadf6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zeit.de%2Fpolitik%2Fausland%2F2024-05%2Fukraine-krieg-charkiw-bodenangriffe-einmarsch" target="_blank">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) on Friday. “As of now, these attacks have been repelled; battles of varying intensity continue.”</p>



<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine was prepared for the attack, meeting the enemy with troops, brigades and artillery. Yet he cautioned that Russia might send more troops to support the ongoing assault.</p>



<p>“Russia has begun a new wave of counteroffensive actions in this direction,” Zelenskyy said at a news conference in Kyiv. “Now there is a fierce battle in this direction.”</p>



<p>The possible aim of the offensive is creation of a “buffer zone” along the border, Reuters reported a senior <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-sends-reinforcements-after-russian-forces-attack-kharkiv-region-2024-05-10/" target="_blank">Ukrainian military source</a> as saying.</p>



<p>Over the last month, Russia has been increasing its military activities around Kharkiv, exploiting limited Ukrainian air defenses to conduct bombing operations in and around the city.</p>



<p>Located approximately 30 kilometers south of the Russian border, Kharkiv strongly resisted the initial invasion in the spring of 2022. A swift Ukrainian counteroffensive in September of the same year pushed back Moscow&#8217;s forces back far enough to allow many civilians to return.</p>
