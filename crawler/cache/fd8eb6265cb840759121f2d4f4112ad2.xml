<p>In this episode we unpack the EU&#8217;s new buzzword and the main point of discussion at this week&#8217;s European Council summit: competitiveness. We also bring you another new buzzword from Brussels this week: Bolshewokism.</p>



<p>Host Sarah Wheaton is joined by POLITICO&#8217;s chief Brussels correspondent, Barbara Moens, to recap the leaders&#8217; summit and their attempt to make the bloc&#8217;s economy more competitive with regards China and the United States. We also discuss former Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta&#8217;s newly released report on how to overhaul the EU&#8217;s single market, and we hear from Letta himself, in conversation with POLITICO&#8217;s own Giovanna Faggionato.</p>



<p>Later, we have a fascinating discussion with Atlantic Council senior fellow and author Elisabeth Braw about her new book &#8220;Goodbye Globalization: The Return of a Divided World.&#8221;</p>



<p>And we end our episode explaining how the word &#8220;Bolshewokism&#8221; came to describe a National Conservatism Conference, featuring Nigel Farage and Viktor Orbán, which was upended by local Brussels mayors.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As the government seeks to ban tobacco  sales to younger generations, parliament's pipe and cigar enthusiasts are feeling nostalgic.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LONDON — The chairman of the Commons and Lords Pipe and Cigar Club has an alarming confession.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;ve never smoked,” says Michael Morris, an 87-year old Conservative peer, whose official title is Lord Naseby. “Actually, that&#8217;s not quite true,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;I did smoke the odd cigar at university, but I&#8217;ve never smoked cigarettes.”</p>



<p>These days the Pipe and Cigar Club, which gained brief notoriety for holding smoking events around the time of the England&#8217;s 2007 ban on puffing on cigarettes indoors in public places, is not what it used to be.</p>



<p>Many of its most well-known members, such as the biscuit magnate Adrian (Lord) Palmer or the World War Two codebreaker Jean Barker (aka Baroness Trumpington,) are since deceased.</p>



<p>The group now meets only once a year for Christmas lunch, according to Rupert Lewis, director of the Tobacco Manufacturers Association, which provided funding and administrative support to the club in its better days.</p>



<p>If U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has his way, there will be no new members of the club among parliamentarians of the future.</p>



<p>This week his <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/britain-conservative-agree-world-toughest-smoke-ban-tory-hate-it-cigar-tobacco/">legislation to introduce a phased smoking ban</a>, meaning those born before 2009 will never be allowed to purchase cigarettes, passed its first stages in parliament. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s has been welcomed by many — but greeted with no little nostalgia by some of Westminster&#8217;s fans of the evil weed. </p>



<p>While it may be increasingly difficult to find parliamentarians willing to champion the joys of smoking, it was not always so.</p>



<p>When the Commons held a crunch vote in 2006 on measures brought forward by Labour under Tony Blair to prohibit smoking in public places, scores of MPs from various parties fought a rearguard action to exempt private clubs from the ban.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Camaraderie in the members&#8217; smoking room</h3>



<p>Before that, the Commons&#8217; members’ smoking room was one of many informal spaces in parliament where MPs could meet, chat, and conspire over a cheroot or two.</p>



<p>“Here it is that Radicals and Tories and Whigs assemble, and under the soothing influence of the cigar forget their hereditary animosities, and amicably discuss the probabilities of the ‘ins’ and the prospects of the ‘outs’,” as one newspaper from 1853 recorded.</p>



<p>Winston Churchill was, unsurprisingly, a stalwart of the smoking room. However, it was not just a Tory hangout; as the <a href="https://historyofparliamentblog.wordpress.com/2020/09/25/the-smoking-room-of-the-house-of-commons/" target="_blank">parliamentary historian Paul Seaward notes</a>, Churchill could be found there arguing with Labour MPs including Aneurin Bevan, father of the National Health Service.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1024" height="749" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/18/GettyImages-3062107-1024x749.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4620393" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/18/GettyImages-3062107.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/18/GettyImages-3062107.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Winston Churchill was, unsurprisingly, a stalwart of the smoking room | Evening Standard/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>Matthew Parris, a Times columnist and Conservative MP in the 1980s, recalls the smoking room as “very masculine … somehow the haze of cigarette smoke and cigar smoke and the fumes of brandy which we used to drink there just made it a very male sort of place.”</p>



<p>Labour&#8217;s Angela Eagle, one of only a handful of sitting female MPs elected before the ban, said: &#8220;Occasionally we [women] used to go into the smoking room mob-handed just to worry them.&#8221;</p>



<p>More than other communal areas of parliament, it had the atmosphere of an old fashioned gentleman&#8217;s club, Parris says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He recounts an occasion in which the famously indulgent Tory MP, the late Spencer Le Marchant<strong> </strong>proposed a “horse race” around the smoking room with older MPs riding on the backs of younger MPs. (The Evening Standard apparently got wind of the scheme and the whips put a stop to it.)</p>



<p>By 1990 another Conservative, Alan Clark, sniffed in his diary: “Now it is frequented only by soaks, traditionalists, and memory-lane buffers.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A cigarette haze in parliament</h3>



<p>But there was still a lively scene conducted under a cigarette haze in parliament right up until the public smoking ban — and afterwards.</p>



<p>Lauren McEvatt, a former special adviser who interned for a Conservative MP in the mid-2000s, has warm memories of  Bellamy&#8217;s bar, now a restaurant which bears little resemblance to its former incarnation.</p>



<p>“Bellamy&#8217;s used to be this really worn-around-the-edges kind of place with squishy armchairs where you sort of had to part the smoke as you walked in,” she says.</p>



<p>One well-known political cigar smoker, Tory grandee Ken Clarke, reputedly took the smoking ban particularly badly, and was rumored to sneak off for the odd puff in the toilet after its introduction.</p>



<p>The ban from 2007 did have some advantages for parliament&#8217;s smokers, however, forging new communities of those forced to gather outside the building to indulge their habit.</p>



<p>“I know so much more about other parties because of encountering other staff members and politicians in the smoking area,” says McEvatt.</p>



<p>Indeed, some of the country&#8217;s most high-profile politicians have found it hard to quit. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2023/04/18/michael-gove-rooftop-smoking-hut-after-heckled-street/" target="_blank">Leveling Up Secretary Michael Gove is said to love smoking so much</a> he had a special hut built on the roof of his ministry to avoid hecklers as he has a crafty cig.</p>



<p>David Cameron, who had spoken of his struggle to ditch nicotine, once described the stress of his doomed EU referendum and leaving Downing Street as leading him to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-cameron-book-i-knew-that-the-enormity-of-the-brexit-vote-would-stay-with-me-for-the-rest-of-my-life-05gmqb72m" target="_blank">take up the habit again</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A dying habit</h3>



<p>A longstanding member of the Lobby — the cadre of Westminster journalists entitled to attend Downing Street briefings — notes that the odd cigarette is useful for intelligence-gathering, since there is “a feeling of solidarity while smoking in cold wet weather, and some people do open up more.”</p>



<p>The journalist did not want to use their name because their family doesn’t know that they smoke — symptomatic of the current landscape in parliament and wider politics, where it is now harder to find smokers who are out and proud.</p>



<p>Kevin Barron, a former Labour MP who was closely involved in shaping the 2007 ban, thinks any nostalgia for smoke-filled rooms is misplaced.</p>



<p>“I was a smoker when I was a young teenager,” he said. “The addiction gets most people when they&#8217;re when they&#8217;re quite young, and … the reality is if you become a regular smoker of combustible cigarettes, 50 percent of people who do that will die a premature death.”</p>



<p>In Tuesday&#8217;s Commons debate on Sunak’s proposals to phase out smoking, only one serving MP admitted to being an active smoker.</p>



<p>But a far greater number refused to give the Tobacco and Vaping Bill their backing, with 57 Tories voting against and a further 106 abstaining.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main objections raised to the bill predominantly by MPs on Sunak’s back benches were that the age cutoff in the bill is unworkable and fundamentally “un-Conservative” in its aim of curtailing consumer choice.</p>



<p>Liz Truss, the short-lived prime minister who was among the Conservative MPs who opposed the bill, said the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13314881/Liz-Truss-government-nannying-cigarettes-ban-Rishi-Sunak-Tory.html" target="_blank">ban “infantilizes” the public</a>, while Boris Johnson, who has abandoned the Commons but not all his influence over the Conservatives, said it was “just mad” for the<a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/its-time-for-a-health-check/"> “party of Winston Churchill”</a> to be phasing out cigars.</p>



<p>Several future leadership hopefuls such as Kemi Badenoch and Penny Mordaunt also conspicuously declined to back the bill.</p>



<p>The legislation is almost certain to pass thanks to backing from the opposition Labour Party. But for now, Sunak’s vision of conservatism seems less palatable to his party than a room full of cigar smoke.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Italy's former PM acknowledged that finding the political will could be an uphill battle as financial issues are "not very sexy" for voters.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>BRUSSELS — Enrico Letta, former prime minister of Italy, is facing a tall order: Make everyone fall in love with the single market. It&#8217;s a task former Commission President Jacques Delors famously said was &#8220;impossible.&#8221;</p>



<p>More concretely, Letta was charged back in June 2023 with <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/ny3j24sm/much-more-than-a-market-report-by-enrico-letta.pdf" target="_blank">authoring</a> a report on how to make the single market fit for purpose. In his report, which came in at 147 pages, the former prime minister said he had wanted to start exactly where Delors stopped: bringing into the single market three sectors — energy, telecoms and finance — that Delors was forced to leave to the sovereignty of member countries. </p>



<p>Many were pleased with the outcome of Letta&#8217;s work, from small tech firms lobby <a href="https://www.digitalsme.eu/letta-report-digital-smes-ready-to-modernise-the-single-market/" target="_blank">Digital SME</a> to French employer lobby <a href="https://www.digitalsme.eu/letta-report-digital-smes-ready-to-modernise-the-single-market/" target="_blank">Medef</a>. </p>



<p>Some, however, were less thrilled. The report’s emphatic call for more consolidation in the telecoms industry can seem a long way from the <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/178710" target="_blank">current approach</a> of regulators. </p>



<p>“We can modify one of the most important parts of the competition rule, which is relevant market,” Letta told a POLITICO event <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.eu/event/past-and-future-shaping-europes-industrial-policy/" target="_blank">on industrial policy Thursday.</a></p>



<p> “You cannot ask [the director of the Commission&#8217;s competition arm] Olivier Guersent to invent new rules &#8230; I think the most important part is to move from 27 markets to one &#8230; to then apply the competition rules to a much bigger relevant market.” </p>



<p>&#8220;Then markets will create champions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is not my job.&#8221;</p>



<p>Letta spent two hours discussing his proposals with EU leaders Thursday within a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-leaders-summit-israel-iran-attack-ukraine-war-live-updates/" target="_blank">special summit</a> on how to integrate the EU&#8217;s financial markets. The talks were “very friendly,” he reported. There “was no blood.”</p>



<p>He described the summit&#8217;s conclusions as &#8220;the&nbsp;first step&#8221; toward actioning the report, while acknowledging it could be an uphill battle given that financial issues are &#8220;not very sexy&#8221; for voters.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“The true step today,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;is to move from the capital markets union as it was before to an idea that we are integrating financial services for a much bigger purpose — that is, to finance the [green and digital] transition.” The point being, he explained, that finance should be a form of leverage to achieve important things for the bloc as a whole and its citizens.</p>



<p>“I am more optimistic today than I was yesterday,” he said.</p>



<p>Part of the challenge, Letta argued, is to find new and more positive ways to make people want closer integration within the EU. “We don&#8217;t have Covid, and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is not enough. Maybe we will have [former U.S. President Donald] Trump, Trump is a great mobilizer.&#8221; He added, however, that he would not wish a negative or &#8220;catastrophic&#8221; mobilizer on the EU. </p>



<p>Letta told POLITICO he hopes his report will be an important tool in the hands of European leaders as well as for Mario Draghi, the former chief of the European Central Bank, who is authoring another report on EU competitiveness. </p>



<p>“There is a clear link,” he said. “Integrating the single market is fundamental to competitiveness.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Corporate lobby group <a href="https://ert.eu/single-market/" target="_blank">European Round Table for Industry</a> calculated that removing internal barriers among the EU27 countries would bring €2.8 trillion to the bloc&#8217;s economy beyond this decade. </p>



<p>If love doesn&#8217;t do the trick — perhaps cash will. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Got some right-wingers? Got a venue? Let the games begin!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em style="font-size: revert;font-family: var(--font-family);color: var(--c-primary)"><em>Welcome to Declassified, a weekly humor column</em></em>.</p>



<p>Hang on, a bunch of far-right leaders were locked into a Brussels conference space with armed police outside, with nothing to sustain them apart from some canapés, and with thousands of Eurocrats in one direction and one of the Belgian capital’s most multicultural neighborhoods in another direction? I feel an idea for a reality TV show coming on!</p>



<p>How about we call it “I’m a right-winger, get me out of here!”? </p>



<p>The National Conservatism Conference —&nbsp;a gathering of Europe’s hard-right elite —&nbsp;sounded about as much fun as an emergency colonoscopy but it was actually a whole lot of fun. Local authorities fell over themselves to not host the event, and (presumably) catering companies across Brussels were given last-minute orders for a lot of finger food that had no&nbsp;spicy ingredients or vegan options (or any other ‘woke’ food such as soya milk or beansprouts).</p>



<p>And when it did start on Tuesday, it was almost immediately shut down before the courts intervened to say that it should go ahead (a timely reminder that judges can be quite useful rather than, say, puppets of the global leftist elite).</p>



<p>But if this is to be an international TV smash, there needs to be added drama. How about having Viktor Orbán, Nigel Farage, Suella Braverman and Eric Zemmour compete against one another to escape from a locked conference center and make it to the airport/Eurostar terminal in the fastest time while also avoiding anyone wearing a lanyard with an EU flag on it? (Bonus points if they can avoid Brussels’ infamous uneven paving stones with dirty water underneath).</p>



<p>The only disappointment from the right-wing conference was their failure to pick Liz Truss as a speaker.</p>



<p>Alas, Truss has been too busy promoting her book “Ten Years to Save The West,” which contains some cracking anecdotes about 10 Downing Street being full of irritating critters who make your skin crawl, which is a horrible thing to say about Boris Johnson and his cabinet (oh, she meant fleas?) and that <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/queen-elizabeth-advice-liz-truss-ten-years-to-save-the-west-book/">Queen Elizabeth II’s advised</a>&nbsp;Truss to “pace yourself,” which is an unfortunate choice of words seeing as the queen died a couple of days later.</p>



<p>“Ten Years to Save The West” is available in the fiction section of all good (and some bad) bookstores.</p>



<p>Fun fact*: It takes longer to read Truss’ book than she lasted as prime minister.</p>



<p><em>*Not an actual fact.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A man has been arrested on suspicion of being involved in a plot to assassinate Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Polish prosecutors have said.</p>



<p>The man, a Polish citizen identified only as Paweł K., was arrested in Poland. Ukraine supplied information leading to his arrest.</p>



<p>“The detained person was charged with reporting readiness to act for foreign intelligence against Republic of Poland, said <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/prokuratura-krajowa/prokuratura-krajowa-przedstawila-zarzuty-osobie-podejrzanej-o-zgloszenie-gotowosci-do-dzialania-na-rzecz-wywiadu-federacji-rosyjskiej" target="_blank">a statement by Poland’s National Prosecutors’ Office</a>. “The act is punishable by up to 8 years&#8217; imprisonment.”</p>



<p>The office said its investigation had revealed that Paweł K. was willing to act for Russian military intelligence and provided information on Rzeszów-Jasionka Airport in the southeast of Poland less than 100 kilometers from its border with Ukraine.</p>



<p>It’s the second arrest of alleged Russia-linked operatives this week after Germany detained two people it said had been plotting attacks within its borders.</p>



<p>Zelenskyy has said there have been numerous attempts on his life since Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The stark warning from a top administration official comes as Kyiv worries about Russia’s looming summer offensive.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CIA Director William Burns offered a stark warning to lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Thursday: If you don’t approve aid to Ukraine now, Kyiv could lose the war by the end of the year.</p>



<p>Speaking at an event at the George W. Bush Presidential Center, Burns urged lawmakers to pass the supplemental that would dedicate billions to Ukraine’s war efforts.</p>



<p>“With the boost that would come from military assistance, both practically and psychologically, Ukrainians are entirely capable of holding their own through 2024 and puncturing Putin’s arrogant view that time is on his side,” he said.</p>



<p>But if that doesn’t make it through Congress, “the picture is a lot more dire,” he continued. “There is a very real risk that the Ukrainians could lose on the battlefield by the end of 2024, or at least put Putin in a position where he could essentially dictate the terms of a political settlement.”</p>



<p>It’s perhaps the strongest warning from a senior administration official yet regarding the war, coming as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2024/04/17/ukraine-on-edge-of-defeat-as-it-waits-for-aid-00152869" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officials in Kyiv warn</a>&nbsp;that a looming Russian offensive in the summer — which would see massive waves of troops invading Ukraine — could overwhelm Kyiv’s struggling soldiers.</p>



<p>Burns’ remarks come a day after House Speaker&nbsp;Mike Johnson&nbsp;unveiled his&nbsp;highly-anticipated foreign aid package, which hangs in the balance as the speaker tries to secure the votes needed to tee up floor debate.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. C.Q. Brown told lawmakers that Ukraine’s “hard-fought gains can be lost without our support,” while Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also warned that if the supplemental is delayed, allies and partners “will question whether or not … we are a reliable partner.”</p>



<p>President Joe Biden also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/17/biden-johnson-foreign-aid-plan-00152848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said he strongly supports the bills</a>&nbsp;released by Johnson. For months, the administration has said lawmakers’ inability to pass Ukraine aid is a major reason Kyiv’s is struggling on the battlefield.</p>



<p>Supporting Ukraine right now is about more than the war with Russia, Burns argued during the event.</p>



<p>“It’s also about Xi Jinping in China, his ambitions, and our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific,” he said. “This is really a question of whether or not our adversaries understand our reliability and determination and whether our allies and partners understand that as well.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Draft law "goes against the wishes of the overwhelming majority" of country's citizens, Washington warns.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A controversial plan to tighten restrictions on civil society in Georgia has echoes of Russian authoritarianism and undermines the country&#8217;s relations with the West, the U.S. State Department warned Thursday in the toughest criticism of the proposals to date.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.state.gov/georgia-transparency-of-foreign-influence-draft-law/" target="_blank">statement</a> published Thursday, spokesman Matthew Miller said American officials are &#8220;gravely disappointed&#8221; by the reintroduction of the &#8220;Kremlin-inspired&#8221; foreign agent bill, a year after nationwide protests and international condemnation forced the Georgian government to shelve a previous version of the proposals. </p>



<p>&#8220;We join our European allies in urging Georgia not to enact legislation that goes against the wishes of&nbsp;the overwhelming majority of&nbsp;Georgian citizens — the desire to integrate fully into the EU,&#8221; Miller said. </p>



<p>The rules would require NGOs, campaign groups and media outlets that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as agents of &#8220;foreign influence.&#8221; If adopted, Miller said, the measures &#8220;could&nbsp;limit freedom of expression,&nbsp;stigmatize organizations that&nbsp;deliver these benefits to the citizens of Georgia, and impede&nbsp;independent media organizations&nbsp;working to provide&nbsp;Georgians&nbsp;with access&nbsp;to high quality information.&#8221; The overall effect would be to undermine civil society, he concluded.</p>



<p>On Wednesday the bill, introduced by the governing Georgian Dream party, took another step toward becoming law by passing first reading in parliament. Thousands protested on the streets of the capital Tbilisi, condemning the bill as a &#8220;Russian law&#8221; and waving EU flags, before being forcibly cleared by riot police.</p>



<p>Speaking to POLITICO last week, a European Commission spokesperson <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/georgia-european-union-candidacy-protest-nana-malashkhia-georgian-dream-party/">called on the government to withdraw the measures</a>. Last year&#8217;s decision to grant candidate status to the South Caucasus country, the official said, had been taken on the understanding that several subsequent steps would be taken by Tbilisi, including &#8220;ensuring freedom of assembly and expression and to consult and engage with civil society.&#8221;</p>



<p>Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has refused to back down, however, accusing American and European officials of &#8220;persist[ing] to make groundless political statements in public space.&#8221; He called on them instead to debate the issue with him publicly, insisting the measures are compatible with joining the EU — a claim Brussels has contradicted. </p>



<p>In a December 2023 nationwide poll conducted by the National Democratic Institute, <a href="https://www.ndi.org/publications/ndi-poll-georgian-citizens-remain-committed-eu-membership-nation-united-its-dreams-and" target="_blank">79 percent of Georgian respondents</a> supported their country&#8217;s EU membership ambitions.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, Georgian Dream&#8217;s parliamentary leader Mamuka Mdinaradze was <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/georgia-parliament-ruling-party-leader-mdinaradze-punched-elisashvili-russian-law-outrage/">assaulted in the legislature</a> while defending the foreign agent proposals, sparking a brawl among MPs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Revolutionary Guards' commander suggests Iran could review long standing "doctrine and nuclear policies."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A top Iranian commander has delivered a strong hint Iran could develop nuclear weapons if Israel were to launch an attack on its atomic facilities. </p>



<p>Ahmad Haqtalab, a Revolutionary Guards&#8217; officer who heads the nuclear protection and security corps, said Tehran could review its long-standing &#8220;doctrine and nuclear policies,&#8221; in which Iran has insisted it is running an atomic program only for civilian — and not military — ends. </p>



<p>“If the fake Zionist regime intends to resort to the threat of attacking our nuclear facilities as a means to put pressure on Iran, reviewing the current doctrine and nuclear policies of the Islamic Republic and distancing from past considerations is possible and conceivable,” Haqtalab was quoted as saying the official <a href="https://en.irna.ir/news/85449219/Iran-nuclear-facilities-secure-country-ready-to-fire-powerful" target="_blank">IRNA state news agency</a>.</p>



<p>His remarks are the latest in a string of warnings from Iranian officials to Israel, which is weighing its response to a barrage of 300 drones and missiles that Tehran launched toward Israeli territory over the weekend.  </p>



<p>Iran has always insisted its uranium enrichment program is only intended for the  production of electricity. Its senior leaders — many with memories of the use of chemical weapons against Iran in the 1980-1988 war with Iraq — have also said they oppose the development of weapons of mass destruction on moral and religious grounds. </p>



<p>Israel and many Western intelligence services, however, have countered that Iran&#8217;s facilities go well beyond what is required for peaceful purposes and are working in tandem with its advanced ballistics projects.</p>



<p>Some diplomats argue Iran has been exacting diplomatic leverage by seeking to acquire &#8220;break-out&#8221; potential, when it has technology to weaponize. So far, it has held back from crossing that Rubicon through fear of a military escalation with Israel and the U.S. </p>



<p>Tensions in the Middle East are rising dramatically, with Western allies concerned about a large-scale escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/eu-makes-united-call-for-israeli-restraint/">urging Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to show restraint</a> in his response to the Iranian attack. As Israel continues to mull its options, Netanyahu made some of his allies nervous this week when he said Israel would <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-expect-israel-retaliate-after-iran-attack-david-cameron-netanyahu/">&#8220;make our decisions ourselves&#8221;</a> and  &#8220;do whatever is necessary to defend itself.”</p>



<p>Haqtalab said Tehran was &#8220;ready to face any threat from the Zionist regime in the vast land of Iran&#8221; and that Tehran would be able to take out Israel&#8217;s nuclear facilities in case of an escalation. </p>



<p>&#8220;The nuclear centers of the Zionist enemy are identified and the necessary information about all targets is at our disposal, so to speak, to respond to possible action. The [Iranian forces] have their hands on the trigger to fire powerful missiles to destroy the targets identified, &#8221; he said. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[A defense industry delegation from Berlin spies opportunities amid the rubble. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>BERLIN — On the ground in Ukraine, Robert Habeck is thinking of the future after the war.</p>



<p>Along with a delegation of defense and energy industry bosses, Germany&#8217;s Vice Chancellor arrived in Kyiv on Thursday looking to plug his country&#8217;s industrial heavyweights into Ukraine&#8217;s economy, on everything from armament production to power grid resilience.</p>



<p>But while major German arms contractors are delivering weapons systems for Ukraine&#8217;s war against the Russian invasion, they&#8217;re also gearing up to make the most of what may be a major business opportunity for the future. </p>



<p>There will be money to be made out of Ukraine&#8217;s reconstruction. On top of that, analysts say the live battlefield environment can serve as a lab for arms companies to test their latest military technology. </p>



<p>&#8220;The German defence industry is supporting the fight for freedom and democracy with their commitment in Ukraine,&#8221; Habeck said in an emailed statement. &#8220;With their private investments, they are contributing to the country’s security and resilience.&#8221;</p>



<p>His trip follows months of criticism over Germany&#8217;s refusal to send Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine. Berlin formally launched an initiative to form an air defense alliance for Ukraine this week, calling on allies to find and finance extra systems to combat Russian missile attacks.</p>



<p>Spying investment opportunities that will outlive the war with Russia, defense manufacturer Rheinmetall has already said it plans to develop production plants inside Ukraine —&nbsp;for vehicle maintenance and artillery ammunition.</p>



<p>Setting up factories in Ukraine offers both a quick market, with low production costs and secured demand, and the chance to test technical innovations, said Guntram Wolff,&nbsp;a senior fellow at the Brussels-based Bruegel think tank. </p>



<p>“Whatever you produce there you can test and innovate working with local military experts to develop cutting edge new systems,” said Wolff. “That’s the real business case. It’s like a laboratory.”</p>



<p>Before traveling Kyiv, Habeck hosted executives for a roundtable discussion in March aimed at figuring out how to ramp up defense production capacity to help Ukraine.</p>



<p>The delegation Habeck has taken with him includes representatives from arms firms Rheinmetall and Diehl, which are set to deliver critical equipment like the IRIS-T air defense system, an official with knowledge of the trip told POLITICO. Others such as FAE-Group and Quantum Systems, which provide mine-clearing vehicles and reconnaissance drones, are also on the visit. </p>



<p>Over the next few days, Habeck and the Kyiv government are expected to launch multiple German-Ukrainian industrial collaboration projects — some under tight security.</p>

<p>Also part of the delegation are two energy firms tasked with securing decentralized power generation through renewable energy.</p>



<p>Those joining Habeck for the night train from Poland to Kyiv were asked to leave their mobile phones at home, and neither confirm or deny their travel plans, the official familiar with the trip said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the matter is sensitive.</p>



<p>The journey began soon after a cabinet meeting, with Habeck traveling to Eastern Poland to meet the delegation. From there, the group continued by night train to Kyiv, arriving in the early hours of Thursday.  </p>



<p>The official cited above pointed to Habeck’s frustration with the slow pace of aid and supply commitments from allies, prompting him to take matters into his own hands. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Dubbed the "plank of England" by one newspaper, Bailey hasn't always been the most popular figure — but, perversely, criticism from Truss has helped.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It should have been a terrible week for the governor of the Bank of England. But Liz Truss saved him — and it’s not the first time.</p>



<p>It wasn’t Truss’ intention. The ex-prime minister this week <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/chief-bank-england-andrew-bailey-should-be-sacked-liz-truss-says/">called for Andrew Bailey’s head</a> and demanded a “proper investigation” into the central bank’s response to her mini-budget in 2022 — which roiled the markets and led to her departure from No. 10.</p>



<p>That kind of criticism from a former head of government would normally pile pressure on any central bank governor — particularly one facing a tough week of sticky economic figures and a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/bernanke-boe-needs-to-open-its-mind-and-its-wallet-to-get-forecasting-right/">report slamming the central bank’s</a> forecasting prowess. </p>



<p>But the Truss attacks may actually burnish Bailey’s credentials.</p>



<p>“If you’re thought of in a bad way by an idiot, then that’s a good thing,” said Tony Yates, an economist and former BoE official. </p>



<p>Truss, the U.K.’s shortest-serving PM who lasted just 49 days in office, described the Bank’s efforts to calm markets in September 2022 as a “smear” and blamed Bailey and other members of the “economic establishment” for her downfall. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But no one seems to have taken any notice. It’s reminiscent of the market turmoil witnessed in Sept. 2022, which turned Bailey’s reputation around from someone who couldn’t handle soaring inflation to the grown-up in the room in contrast to a flailing government.</p>



<p>And the latest ax-grinding still isn’t hitting home.</p>



<p>“We have absolute confidence in our independent Bank of England, the governor, I think they’re doing a great job under very difficult circumstances,” Gareth Davies, the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPefgDKWOgg" target="_blank">told Bloomberg</a> this week. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Economic dilemma</h3>



<p>Truss’ interventions may in fact be a helpful distraction for the governor, who does have real problems to grapple with.</p>



<p>Bailey has just endured a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4433c035-fa80-49ad-a3dd-a3af2c509e0c" target="_blank">scathing review</a> by former Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke of the Bank’s economic forecasting, for failing to predict the surge in inflation after the pandemic. </p>



<p>And the Bank faces a pivotal decision this summer.</p>



<p>After initially struggling to get surging prices under control following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the BoE has hiked interest rates up to 5.25 percent.</p>



<p>Now, it faces the opposite problem: should it start cutting rates as inflation is falling, or wait for surer signs of a healthy economy? &nbsp;</p>



<p>The picture was further complicated this week when the International Monetary Fund <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/uk-set-to-grow-less-than-expected-this-year-as-imf-revises-forecasts-down-13116091" target="_blank">revised down</a> its growth predictions for the U.K. economy. Plus, the U.K.’s statistics agency published challenging job numbers and higher-than-expected inflation figures. </p>



<p>It’s a perilous moment, because moving too quickly on cutting rates could actually end up keeping inflation high.</p>



<p>“The BoE will need to continue navigating the delicate balance between supporting economic recovery while managing inflationary pressures,” said David&nbsp;McCreadie, chief executive of Secure Trust Bank.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Track record</h3>



<p>Yet amid that dicey backdrop, it&#8217;s Truss’ criticism that has sucked up all the oxygen.</p>



<p>“The economic establishment used its huge and unrivalled influence over the markets to undermine confidence in the elected government, stir up political resistance and force it to change course,” Truss writes in <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/liz-truss-trump-brexit-fleas-book-united-kingdom/">her new book</a>. (“Of course we didn’t depose Liz Truss. I would never do something like that,” Bailey said at the time.)</p>



<p>Truss slammed the Bank for not informing her or taking action to tackle the problems at pension funds — which became stuck in a loop of forced selling of government bonds — before her mini-budget.</p>



<p>“It was our misfortune to be the ones who entered a room full of petrol carrying a candle,” she wrote.</p>



<p>But Yates, the former BoE official, said she hadn’t grasped the problem because the bond market sell-off was driven by Truss’ unfunded tax cuts and surpassed expectations.</p>



<p>“The sort of more substantive technical points about what happened aren’t really developed or even fair,” he said.</p>



<p>That makes them easy for Bailey to shrug off or ignore — even though his handling of the economy and his communication skills haven’t always got top marks.</p>



<p>The Sun newspaper took to calling him the “<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22769458/bank-of-england-andrew-bailey-mortgage-inflation-trevor-kavanagh/" target="_blank">plank of England</a>” amid the soaring cost-of-living and painful mortgage rates for U.K. households, as the BoE raised rates to the highest level in over a decade.</p>



<p>And, while the Bank calmed markets after Truss’ mini-budget in 2022, Bailey <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/155207" target="_blank">came under fire</a> for crashing the pound by setting a hard deadline for pension funds to tap the Bank for funding during a talk in Washington. </p>



<p>Yet Bailey’s handling of Truss’ time in government also generated more support in the City of London, which doesn&#8217;t want instability to affect its reputation.</p>



<p>It also left MPs and other policymakers looking to the BoE for answers on how to handle the volatile economic situation, rather than the Chancellor at the time — Kwasi Kwarteng, Truss’ right-hand man behind the mini-budget — who lasted even less time in his role than Truss.</p>



<p>The drama also gave some respite from the bigger questions about the Bank’s core mission to keep prices stable. </p>



<p>As Bailey returned to Washington <a href="https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/1780628722397110335" target="_blank">for the same event this week</a>, this time the pound stayed steady. And so too has his role — despite Truss’ best efforts.</p>
