					<description><![CDATA[Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wants to stub out cigarettes for future generations — but a chunk of his own MPs are railing against it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LONDON — Eighteen months into his premiership and facing electoral wipeout, Rishi Sunak was in search of a legacy.</p>



<p>It was in this state of mind last year that the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/">flagging</a> U.K. prime minister proposed a phased, generational ban on smoking — something almost without precedent throughout the world.</p>



<p>On Tuesday night the plan moved one step toward becoming a reality, when the House of Commons passed legislation paving the way for the ban at its first major parliamentary stage — but not without plenty of grumbling from Sunak&#8217;s own restive MPs.</p>



<p>The policy means it will be illegal to sell tobacco products to anyone born on or after January 1, 2009 — effectively preventing children turning 15 or younger this year from ever legally buying tobacco.</p>



<p>A near-identical plan was due to come into force in New Zealand under then-PM Jacinda Ardern, before it was reversed by her successors before anyone had been prevented from taking up the habit. </p>



<p>That means Sunak is genuinely set to make history — just don&#8217;t expect him to get much thanks for it from his own party, which is riven by splits after 14 years in power.</p>



<p>&#8220;It will save more lives than any other decision we could take,&#8221; Sunak argued as he unveiled the plan in his party conference speech last October. &#8220;As prime minister I have an obligation to do what I think is the right thing for our country in the long-term.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some Conservatives weren&#8217;t buying a center-right prime minister making the ban a key tenet of his pitch to voters, however. And plenty in Westminster were watching the vote for signs of how the purity test of the next Conservative leadership contest might shape up.</p>



<p>“What’s his legacy going to be? Banning smoking?&#8221; asked one skeptical minister, granted anonymity to speak freely about government decision-making, of Sunak. &#8220;Is that really how he wants to be remembered?&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Blue fury</h3>



<p>In the event, 59 Tory MPs voted against the measure at its second reading Tuesday night. Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch — seen as a key contender to become the next leader should the Tories lose the election — was among those in Sunak&#8217;s own ministerial ranks voting against the bill, citing what she called &#8220;significant concerns.&#8221;</p>



<p>At least six members of the government payroll voted against Sunak, and Badenoch&#8217;s fellow Cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt — another post-Sunak leadership favorite — abstained. There were more than 100 Tory abstentions.</p>



<p>Ahead of the crunch, and recognizing the likely opposition from his party, which contains a sizable libertarian caucus, Sunak had offered a free, un-whipped vote. That meant his parliamentary troops could rebel without punishment on a matter of conscience. </p>



<p>The opposition Labour Party, riding high in the polls in an election year, painted the move as a sign of weakness on Sunak&#8217;s part. Labour MPs were ordered to vote in favor of the legislation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16/GettyImages-2147795108-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4604745" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16/GettyImages-2147795108.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16/GettyImages-2147795108.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sunak is genuinely set to make history — just don&#8217;t expect him to get much thanks for it from his own party. | POOL photo by Benjamin Cremel/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a sign of the psychodrama around the vote, some of the most strident criticism of Sunak&#8217;s plan came from the prime minister&#8217;s immediate predecessors — each of whom has their own ax to grind with Sunak after years of Tory in-fighting.</p>



<p>Former PM Liz Truss <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68816566" target="_blank">told the BBC</a> the plans were &#8220;un-Conservative&#8221; — and voted against the bill. She warned MPs during Tuesday&#8217;s Commons debate that &#8220;the health police&#8221; will next move to trying to restrict food or alcohol.</p>



<p>Truss&#8217; predecessor Boris Johnson, no longer an MP, has similarly described the plans as &#8220;nuts.&#8221;</p>



<p>“The party of Winston Churchill wants to ban [cigars]?” complained Johnson, speaking at <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68787914" target="_blank">a conference in Ottawa last week</a>, and evoking the memory of the cigar-chomping wartime leader.</p>



<p>Responding to Johnson, Sunak&#8217;s Health Secretary Victoria Atkins was reduced to arguing that under the plan Churchill would not have been prevented from smoking cigars in adulthood. </p>



<p>Ministers and supporters also point to <a href="https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1778403806675407336" target="_blank">widespread public backing</a> for the policy, including among Conservative voters — and say it will reduce much strain on public services.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Helpful reds</h3>



<p>Despite the scale of the Conservative rebellion Tuesday, the smoking bill passed easily thanks to support from Labour — something the opposition sought to make political hay over.</p>



<p>&#8220;The prime minister may be too weak to whip his MPs to vote for this important bill, but on these benches we will put country first and foremost,&#8221; Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting told the Commons. &#8220;We will resist the temptation to play games on votes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Instead, we will go through the voting lobbies today to make sure that this legislation is passed so that young people today are even less likely to smoke than they are to vote for the Conservatives,&#8221; Streeting quipped.</p>



<p>Labour&#8217;s widespread support for the measure ensures that its safe passage through its next stages in parliament appears secure, even if some Conservative rebels attempt to amend it down the line in order to water down its aims.</p>



<p>For Sunak, that means at least one aspect of his legacy is safe — even if it&#8217;s cost cost him yet another public bust-up with his own party.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Too early to say" if ECR and ID will merge, former Polish PM says. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>BRUSSELS —&nbsp;Former Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki left the door open to a possible merger between his Euroskeptic political grouping and the far right in the European Parliament.</p>



<p>It &#8220;remains to be seen what are going to be the final results of the European elections and we’ll see,&#8221; Morawiecki told POLITICO after a press conference with Hungary&#8217;s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and the former director of EU border agency Frontex, Fabrice Leggeri, who is a candidate for France&#8217;s National Rally.</p>



<p>Asked if the press conference was a sign of increased <em>rapprochement</em> between Morawiecki&#8217;s hard-right European Conservatives and Reformists group and Leggeri&#8217;s far-right Identity &amp; Democracy, the Polish ex-PM said: &#8220;It’s too early to say, it takes two to tango and all the delegations within the ECR group have to have their voice and we are treating everybody with utmost respect and importance.&#8221;  </p>



<p>Several members of ID, including Vlaams Belang MEP Gerolf Annemans and far-right German MEP Maximilian Krah, attended the event in the European Parliament, hosted by the ECR.  </p>



<p>The conference demonstrated that the parties share much common ground when it comes to attacking the EU&#8217;s new migration deal, bashing bureaucrats, and pillorying the Green Deal as devastating for national industries. </p>



<p>However, apart from saying that discussions on Ukraine&#8217;s membership in the EU should be divorced from talk about its war with Russia, Orbán avoided the subject.</p>



<p>Fidesz MEP Kinga Gál said she hoped her party would join the ECR (Fidesz has been politically homeless in Europe since leaving the center-right European People’s Party in 2021).</p>



<p>Gál also brushed off notions that Fidesz and Poland&#8217;s Law &amp; Justice (Morawiecki&#8217;s party) differ on supporting Ukraine against Russian invaders. &#8220;I am very positive about that,&#8221; she said, arguing the two had plenty in common as parties running on a &#8220;sovereigntist&#8221; platform.</p>



<p>National Rally MEP Gilles Lebreton said &#8220;negotiations are underway,&#8221; but downplayed the importance of forming a single large group combining Euroskeptics, nationalists and the far right.  </p>



<p>&#8220;Whether there&#8217;s one group or two groups, I&#8217;m completely indifferent,&#8221; he said. </p>



<p>Morawiecki was clear, however, on wanting MEPs from Orbán&#8217;s Fidesz to join the ECR —&nbsp;a suggestion that has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/eu-election-playbook/cracks-appear-in-euroskeptic-camp-as-orban-stalks-the-parliament/">already caused consternation</a> among some of Ukraine&#8217;s most staunch allies in the political faction. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are talking very intensively and I hope Viktor will join our group, but it’s his decision and it’s the decision of our delegations as well,&#8221; Morawiecki said. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Normandy event organizers give Kremlin chief the cold shoulder over Ukraine war. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>French organizers have invited Russian representatives to a ceremony in recognition of the 80th anniversary of the World War II D-Day landings in Normandy. </p>



<p>Numerous <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/04/16/russia-but-not-putin-invited-to-french-d-day-anniversary-organizers-a84859" target="_blank">world leaders</a> — including U.S. President Joe Biden — also made the guest list for the early June celebration.</p>



<p>But guess who didn’t? Russian President Vladimir Putin, on account of his <a href="https://www.europe1.fr/politique/info-europe-1-la-russie-invitee-aux-commemorations-du-80eme-anniversaire-du-debarquement-4241718" target="_blank">&#8220;war of aggression&#8221; in Ukraine</a>, event organizers said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Given the circumstances, President Putin will not be invited to take part in the commemorations of the Normandy landings,&#8221; they said <a href="https://www.lesoir.be/581454/article/2024-04-16/la-france-invite-la-russie-au-80e-anniversaire-du-debarquement-en-normandie" target="_blank">according to the French newswire AFP.</a></p>



<p>A Russian delegation, however, was invited, though organizers were not specific about who precisely would be among the Russian invitees. The ceremony will honor “those who stood up, those who suffered, and those who fought and liberated,” <a href="https://www.calvados.gouv.fr/Actions-de-l-Etat/80e-anniversaire-du-Debarquement-et-de-la-liberation-de-la-Normandie/La-Mission-Liberation/80-ans-de-la-Liberation-les-grandes-lignes-du-programme" target="_blank">according to organizers.</a></p>



<p>In June 1944, allied troops stormed the German-held beaches in Normandy at the beginning of a land invasion of continental Europe which ended with victory over the Nazis in 1945. The Soviet Union fought Adolf Hitler&#8217;s forces on the eastern front for years, gradually pushing them back before also reaching Berlin.</p>



<p>It’s not the first time Putin has been snubbed by a similar event. He was not invited to the <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/international/pourquoi-poutine-n-a-t-il-pas-ete-invite-aux-ceremonies-du-d-day-20190605" target="_blank">75th anniversary of D-Day in 2019</a>, where figures including Theresa May, Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Charles, Angela Merkel and Donald Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyalFamily/status/1136218463666626561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1136218463666626561%7Ctwgr%5E51b25803cb068ec65568df7c907c4c0eec7f8558%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.royal.uk%2F75th-anniversary-d-day-landings" data-type="link" data-id="https://twitter.com/RoyalFamily/status/1136218463666626561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1136218463666626561%7Ctwgr%5E51b25803cb068ec65568df7c907c4c0eec7f8558%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.royal.uk%2F75th-anniversary-d-day-landings" target="_blank">were in attendance.</a></p>



<p>At the time, Putin made it known that he didn’t care.&nbsp;Honest. </p>



<p>&#8220;Why should they always invite me everywhere? What am I, an operetta general? I&#8217;ve got enough to do here, it&#8217;s absolutely not a problem,&#8221; he told news agencies, <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/international/pourquoi-poutine-n-a-t-il-pas-ete-invite-aux-ceremonies-du-d-day-20190605" target="_blank">according to Le Figaro.</a></p>



<p>The Russian president was, however, invited to the 70th anniversary commemoration of D-Day <a href="https://www.france24.com/fr/20140508-vladimir-poutine-participera-commemorations-debarquement-normandie-russie-hollande-guerre-ukraine" target="_blank">in 2014</a>, despite his illegal annexation of Ukraine&#8217;s Crimean peninsula a few months earlier.</p>



<p>&#8220;We can have differences with Vladimir Putin, but I don&#8217;t forget and will never forget that the Russian people gave millions of lives&#8221; during World War II, said former French President François Hollande, who had <a href="https://www.france24.com/fr/20140508-vladimir-poutine-participera-commemorations-debarquement-normandie-russie-hollande-guerre-ukraine" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.france24.com/fr/20140508-vladimir-poutine-participera-commemorations-debarquement-normandie-russie-hollande-guerre-ukraine" target="_blank">extended the invitation to Putin in 2014</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Historically, France has always invited countries whose contingents landed in Normandy to take part in the ceremony. In the past, the invitation has also been extended to the Russian Federation&#8221; <a href="https://www.lesoir.be/581454/article/2024-04-16/la-france-invite-la-russie-au-80e-anniversaire-du-debarquement-en-normandie" target="_blank">the organizers said</a> Tuesday.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Kyiv needs Western weapons to help defend the city, an army spokesperson told POLITICO.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>KYIV — A Russian victory in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Chasiv Yar, currently the target of a sustained military offensive, would jeopardize the security of the remaining Ukrainian-held cities in Donetsk, a senior Ukrainian official told POLITICO on Tuesday.</p>



<p>“If the Russian occupiers manage to capture this city, they will have the opportunity to launch an offensive on Kostiantynivka, Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk,&#8221; said Lieutenant Colonel Nazar Voloshyn, a Ukrainian army spokesperson.</p>



<p>&#8220;These cities are the last stronghold of Donetsk region, which is under the control of Ukraine,” he added.</p>



<p>Chasiv Yar is a strategically important city located 10 kilometers from Bakhmut. It is situated on commanding heights, advantageous for defense and gives control over the surrounding area. It is currently under the full control of Kyiv but also under <a href="https://deepstatemap.live/en?#12/48.5622/37.9502" target="_blank">sustained attack from Russian troops</a>.</p>



<p>“This is the dominant height in the region, and its control will allow the Russian invaders, if they achieve it, to significantly simplify the advance in the direction of Kostiantynivka and the direction of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk,” Voloshyn said.</p>



<p>The Kremlin ordered that Chasiv Yar should be seized before May 9 — the day Russian celebrates the Soviet victory in World War II and a sacred holiday for Russian military propaganda that desperately needs a big victory on the war front, Voloshyn added.</p>



<p>Russian military bloggers <a href="https://ura.news/news/1052751350" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that Chasiv Yar is an important milestone on the way to occupying the entire Donetsk region and fulfilling one of the “special operation main goals Putin set for them.”</p>



<p>Ukrainian troops have so far “literally dug into the ground” to hold back the enemy&#8217;s daily attacks, Oleksandr Syrskiy, Ukraine’s army commander-in-chief, <a href="https://t.me/osirskiy/652" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> on Sunday.</p>



<p>Russian forces have been using their advantage in troop numbers to organize attacks in small groups with the support of artillery and aviation, leveling civilian buildings and critical infrastructure with aerial bombs and artillery, and then sending their troops to storm the reinforced Ukrainian positions. Recently Russia redeployed troops from nearby Lyman to Chasiv Yar.</p>



<p>Russian troops <a href="https://aif.ru/society/army/deputat-vodolackiy-vs-rf-ostalos-okolo-500-metrov-do-granicy-chasov-yara" data-type="link" data-id="https://aif.ru/society/army/deputat-vodolackiy-vs-rf-ostalos-okolo-500-metrov-do-granicy-chasov-yara" target="_blank">claimed</a> to be only 500 meters out from Chasiv Yar, but Voloshyn said the city and its surroundings were still under Kyiv&#8217;s control. To prevent the city&#8217;s fall, the Ukrainian command has been strengthening brigades fighting near Chasiv Yar with ammunition, drones and electronic warfare equipment, Syrskiy said.</p>



<p>However, Sirskiy indicated that Ukrainian troops also need a morale boost. “There’s a need to improve the quality of training, including the moral and psychological component,” Sirskiy said. </p>



<p>Voloshyn told POLITICO that, despite the constant attacks, the Russians were unlikely to reach their goal. However, he stressed that Kyiv needs Western air defense, F16 jets and other weapons to be able to change the situation around Bakhmut and Avdiivka, where the Russians are taking advantage of Kyiv&#8217;s lack of ammo and Moscow&#8217;s air superiority.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[World is waiting to see how Israel will retaliate after Iran’s attack, and if Bibi will match the forbearance of a legendary predecessor.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Jamie Dettmer is opinion editor at POLITICO Europe.</em></p>



<p>Long before the Iron Dome and David’s Sling, over several weeks in January 1991, Iraq launched 42 Scud missiles at Israel, primarily targeting the coastal cities of Tel Aviv and Haifa. </p>



<p>Iraq’s then-President Saddam Hussein’s hope was to provoke, calculating Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir would stay true to his pugnacious character and retaliate, prompting Arab states to forsake the U.S.-led coalition to liberate Kuwait.</p>



<p>But a surprising thing happened. Shamir — never a man to shy from battle — unexpectedly heeded the pleas of allies, and Israel refrained from responding.</p>



<p>Now, some 30 years later, as the world waits to see how Israel will retaliate after Iran’s first-ever direct attack on the country, the question is: Will Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu match the uncharacteristic forbearance of his predecessor?</p>



<p>In order to convince Shamir, then-U.S. President George H. Bush and Secretary of State James Baker worked hard, arguing the coalition risked falling apart if Israel were to react. They also promised increased U.S. military aid to Israel, including more Patriot air-defense missiles.</p>



<p>But it wasn’t just American pleas and promises of aid that worked to restrain the Israeli leader. King Hussein of Jordan was crucial — much as his son, current monarch King Abdullah II, may now prove pivotal in containing the naturally bellicose Netanyahu, or at the very least help persuade him to respond in a symbolic, more measured manner.</p>



<p>Abdullah’s arguments will be similar to those of his father: that forbearance will benefit Israel, that restraint will be for the greater good of the entire region, and that retaliation will have a grave impact on Israel’s security.</p>



<p>And just as his father’s arguments were bolstered by the <a href="https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/the-day-israels-wars-changed-forever-655785" target="_blank">low casualties and minimal structural damage Israel suffered from Iraq’s Scud strikes</a>, so too will Abdullah’s. There were no deaths from Iran’s attack on Israel at the weekend, and only minor damage to buildings on an Israeli airbase.</p>



<p>While this is all thanks to Israel’s advanced multi-layered air defense system — some parts of it truly tested for the first time — it’s also due to the crucial assistance of Western allies and Arab states alike.</p>



<p>Jordan not only joined Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates in sharing intelligence and radar information with the U.S., but it also actively helped shoot down explosive-laden drones heading toward Israel.</p>



<p>Despite Abdullah’s scathing public criticism of how Netanyahu has waged war against Hamas in Gaza, the Jordanian monarch didn’t hesitate to come to Israel’s defense. He scrambled his fighter jets to assist in the hastily mounted U.S.-led multinational operation to stop Iran’s missiles and drones from getting through.</p>



<p>“Some flying objects that entered our airspace last night were dealt with and confronted,” <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/04/14/jordan-israel-rescue-iran-threat-idf-drones/" target="_blank">Jordan’s government said</a> in a statement, adding that the country’s military “will confront anything that would expose the security and safety of the nation &#8230; to any danger or transgression by any party.”</p>



<p>This intervention carries considerable political risks for Abdullah — the Hashemite monarchy has clashed with Palestinians before. Abdullah was just eight years old when Jordan was plunged into a civil war in 1970, as his father and the Palestine Liberation Organization battled for control of the country. And today, around 3 million Palestinians live in Jordan, making up 20 percent of the population. </p>



<p>Thus, Abdullah — like other Arab leaders — will expect some gratitude from Bibi for helping to defend Israel. And their pleas for restraint are echoing arguments reportedly made by U.S. President Joe Biden, urging Netanyahu to take the win, as there’s more to gain by showing restraint.</p>



<p>Netanyahu and his predecessor Shamir bear some resemblances — martial backgrounds, staunch obduracy, and reputations for hewing to tough, no-compromise lines.</p>



<p>Born Yitzhak Yezernitsky in what is today’s Belarus, Shamir chose the Hebrew word for thorn for his surname when he arrived in Israel — and he certainly proved to be one in the side of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz. Trying to win Shamir’s support for a Middle East peace plan, a Shultz aide once complained after an exasperating session: “He thinks that because nobody got up on the table and kicked his teeth in that we&#8217;re all happy, and everything&#8217;s OK.&#8221;</p>



<p>And regardless of Israel’s reliance on U.S. support to survive, he seldom budged — but that wasn’t the case in 1991. Despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/21/magazine/the-stubborn-strength-of-yitzhak-shamir.html" target="_blank">famously urging security forces</a> to “repel every attack and to amputate every hand that will be raised against us,” Shamir saw the logic behind holding back.</p>



<p>So, will the notoriously stubborn Netanyahu bend as well? <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-chief-visits-airbase-hit-in-iranian-attack-says-it-will-be-met-with-a-response/" target="_blank">Israeli officials have said there will be a retaliation.</a> “We are looking ahead, we are considering our steps, and this launch of so many missiles, cruise missiles, and UAVs into the territory of the State of Israel will be met with a response,” Chief of the General Staff of Israel Herzi Halevi said Monday. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But in terms of domestic politics, Netanyahu is facing more challenges than his predecessor had confronted. Shamir had to watch his back for challenges from his chief rival within the Likud party, Ariel Sharon, whose star was already waning.</p>



<p>Netanyahu, meanwhile, sits atop a far more rambunctious coalition government. The ultranationalists and far-right religious figures, along with some in his Likud party, are baying for blood and for a direct attack on Iran. They argue that a failure to retaliate will only invite Tehran to try the same thing again, establishing a dangerous new normal.</p>



<p>“In our neighborhood, it will be irresponsible not to retaliate after such an unprecedented attack from Iran against Israel,” Danny Danon, a Likud lawmaker and former Israeli envoy to the U.N., told POLITICO. <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/iran-israel-attach-benjamin-netanyahu-gaza-war/">“Not to retaliate will bring yet another attack from Tehran.”</a> He and others complain that once again Israel is helped when it is assaulted but that Western backing disappears  when it wants to go on the attack, despite that being its best form of defense.</p>



<p>However, others within Netanyahu’s war and wider cabinets are urging restraint, as they see Iran’s attack as a golden opportunity for Israel to build a much more effective international coalition against the mullahs in Tehran. Halevi himself hinted at this in his remarks on Monday, saying the attack had “created new opportunities for cooperation in the Middle East.”</p>



<p>The question Israel is now highlighting, especially in conversations with European leaders and diplomats, is: What would this attack have looked like if Iran had nuclear weapons?</p>



<p>Israel wants there to be consequences for Iran. And the biggest consequence may well be a much tougher, stronger and more determined international coalition aimed at undermining the regime of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, preventing the development of weapons of mass destruction.</p>



<p>Shamir once said: “A man who goes forth to take the life of another whom he does not know must believe only one thing — that by his act he will change the course of history.” But on this occasion, it’s refraining from taking the life of another that might alter the arc of history.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["The monster of the Berlaymont" has been nominated for a new role.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Martin Selmayr, known as the “monster of the Berlaymont,” has been nominated as the EU ambassador to the&nbsp;Vatican, Order of Malta and U.N. organizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell announced on Tuesday in Brussels the <a href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/eeas-high-representative-josep-borrell-nominated-new-heads-eu-delegations-upcoming-diplomatic_en" target="_blank">nominees</a> for the upcoming rotation of EU diplomatic delegations. POLITICO first reported the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/dark-cardinal-selmayr-headed-vatican/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/dark-cardinal-selmayr-headed-vatican/">potential move</a> in March. </p>



<p>Known for a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/dark-cardinal-selmayr-headed-vatican/">harsh leadership</a> approach that resulted in the above nickname, Selmayr caused a stir when he was promoted from then-European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s chief of staff to secretary-general of the Commission in 2018.</p>



<p>The quick appointment to a top civil service post was said <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/selmayr-ombudsman-oreilly-wraps-up-job-probe/">not to have followed EU rules,</a> leading the European Parliament to demand his resignation.</p>



<p>In 2019, Selmayr managed to avoid excommunication by stepping down from his position when Commission President Ursula von der Leyen secured her nomination, a move made in response to criticism over the high number of German officials holding top positions.</p>



<p>As a compromise, he was appointed as the EU ambassador to Austria and sent to Vienna, where he provoked the national government by labeling Austria&#8217;s dependence on Russian gas supplies as &#8220;blood money.&#8221;</p>



<p>Selmayr is currently serving as a high-ranking adviser in the Commission. Since February, he has also been a visiting professor of European law at the institute for innovation and digitalization in law at the University of Vienna.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The European Deposit Insurance Scheme is back on Parliament’s banking union agenda, but key regulatory issues remain unresolved, and premature ‘compromise’ may have a far-reaching impact on upcoming European elections.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Berlin. For seven years, the complex issue of the further development of the banking union has been a matter of debate. Now, suddenly, things are moving: The common European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) is back on the European Parliament’s agenda. The European Parliament&#8217;s ECON Committee is due to vote on the proposed regulation as early as Thursday. A valid reason for this rush? There is none. However, it aligns with the preceding process.</p>



<p>Once again, someone tries to take the second step before the first. In 2015, the European Commission presented a proposal before the revised Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive could even be implemented in the member countries. This initial rush has led to extremely controversial discussions until today. For example, it is completely unclear which elements the further development of the banking union should actually include and how they should be organized. These include, in particular, the regulatory treatment of government bonds, regulatory ring-fencing in host countries and the differences between national insolvency laws. A European deposit insurance system, which is only one discussed element of the banking union, must fit into all of this. Crucial questions that have not yet been resolved.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It is completely unclear which elements the further development of the banking union should actually include and how they should be organized.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The rapporteur at that time, Esther de Lange, did not manage to reach an agreement in the European Parliament. There were concerns that an immature EDIS could do more harm than good. The differences in positions also became apparent in June 2022, when the Eurogroup was unable to reach common understanding on the correct design of the banking union despite serious efforts by Paschal Donohoe. Since then, the objective has been to revise the crisis management for banks (CMDI). It was agreed that only on this basis it could be decided whether and in which form a European deposit protection scheme would be necessary at all.</p>



<p>The vote on CMDI in the European Parliament is scheduled for April 24; the Council&#8217;s position is still completely open. Instead of waiting for this process to be completed, the new EDIS rapporteur in the EP, Othmar Karas, has taken up the EDIS ball since the end of February and initiated a rash quick shot.</p>



<p>There is a considerable risk of repeating the mistake made by the European Commission in 2015 based on hastily-negotiated compromises. In particular, the proposal completely ignores the structural changes resulting from the review of the crisis management of banks. While CMDI is aimed at the resolution of banks, EDIS primarily serves to compensate depositors. This simply does not fit together, and there is a considerable risk that the European Parliament will adopt clashing positions on CMDI and EDIS. This mismatch would create severe uncertainty which does not only have a negative effect on financial stability, but also on the overall competitiveness of the banking sector and the European Union. This cannot be in the interests of those who are in favor of EDIS.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>We therefore call upon the European parliamentarians to postpone the vote on EDIS.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Unlike many technical discussions, the protection of deposits is an issue that is perceived very closely by the European population, not only in Germany. A premature ‘compromise’, such as the one currently being pursued by ECON, could have far-reaching and unforeseeable consequences, especially at the present time — especially just before the upcoming European elections. Every member of the European Parliament should therefore examine very carefully whether they have really considered the implications of the ECON proposal. After all, a wrong decision on this important issue would not only have consequences for the future European Parliament, but also for the European Union as a whole.</p>



<p>We therefore urgently recommend not taking the second step before the first and risk stumbling. We therefore call upon the European parliamentarians to postpone the vote on EDIS. </p>



<p>We are all united by the same goal. But let’s take the time to find a viable way which considers all interests equally. And let us not forget: In the end, half-baked ideas only play into the hands of populists.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Brexiteer also predicted the former US president would return to office come November. "It's gonna be so great."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>BRUSSELS — Brexit champion Nigel Farage said Donald Trump dislikes Brussels so much it makes him look like the EU’s best friend in comparison.</p>



<p>Farage, a British right-wing politician who successfully spearheaded a yearslong campaign to get the U.K. out of the EU, claimed, “I never really repeat what Trump and I say in private, but I do think there are times when Trump makes me look like a Europhile in terms of what he thinks about Brussels structures.&#8221;</p>



<p>During his keynote speech at a controversial hard-right event in Brussels, Farage predicted — performing a half-decent impression of the former U.S. leader — that Trump would be returning to the White House after November&#8217;s U.S. election. “It’s gonna be so great,” he said.</p>



<p>He later called a Dutch journalist “fake news” and said “China” in Trump&#8217;s patented curt style. </p>



<p>Trump famously referred to Brussels as being &#8220;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-brussels-is-like-a-hellhole/">like a hellhole</a>&#8221; when he was first running to be U.S. president.</p>



<p>Farage’s keynote speech at the National Conservative Conference in Brussels took place in a febrile atmosphere after the city’s police <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-police-shut-down-nigel-farage-viktor-orban-right-wing-jamboree/">ordered the event to be shut down</a>. Other scheduled speakers included Suella Braverman, the former British home secretary, and Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán who is slated to speak Wednesday.</p>



<p>As Farage spoke, police gathered at the entrance of the venue. He paid tribute to the “brave Tunisian” owner of the Claridge event space for standing up to “bullyboys” who wanted the event shut down.</p>



<p>The British politician — rumored to be weighing a comeback to front-line national politics —&nbsp; said Trump got China right and praised his Middle East policy on Iran and on forging the Abraham Accords, a series of diplomatic deals between Israel and some Arab nations.&nbsp;He accused EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell of appeasing Iran.</p>



<p>Speaking without notes, Farage played the hits, railing against the EU, calling on its remaining member countries to quit because it is now unreformable and “anti-democratic,” while hitting out at the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights as having been politicized.</p>



<p>He also reflected on his own image in Brussels, quipping that former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt — with whom he regularly clashed as an MEP in the European Parliament — wouldn’t welcome him back with open arms. </p>



<p>“You’ve got to be a bit odd to stand up in the European Parliament and be booed every week by 500 people,” Farage said. “Maybe I’m a bit odd.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Former Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta tells POLITICO that government subsidies should become a "European tool."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>BRUSSELS ― It&#8217;s older than the euro and as integral to the EU as being able to cross borders without a passport ― but the single market is failing to deliver while ever-stronger world economies gain the upper hand.</p>



<p>Enrico Letta, a former Italian prime minister who will hand his report on the issue to EU leaders at their summit in Brussels on Thursday, told POLITICO the bloc needed to be &#8220;less naïve&#8221; if Europe was going to be robust enough in the years ahead.</p>



<p>“I strongly think that we need to create a single market with teeth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is the key point: a single market with teeth.&#8221;</p>



<p>The network of the EU&#8217;s 27 countries, and a few neighboring nations beside, is supposed to allow the free movement of goods, services, people and capital, and came into being in 1993. While seen as one of the EU&#8217;s greatest achievements, politicians still lament the ways it doesn&#8217;t work. With the EU confronted by pressure to remain competitive in the face of emerging powers such as India and China, that needs to change.</p>



<p>Letta&#8217;s report is wide-ranging and, in some places, radical. One of his more controversial suggestions is about the rules for when governments subsidize companies  ― known in the EU as &#8220;state aid&#8221; ― and which the European Commission is in charge of.</p>



<p>The Italian will tell leaders they should explore how these subsidies “can become a more European tool and less a national tool,” he told POLITICO, arguing that Europe needs to avoid internal competition. State aid “can be added to the rest of the European tools,” he added. </p>



<p>The report calls for a state aid contribution mechanism where governments would put some of their national funding into pan-European initiatives.</p>



<p>In the report,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://api.politico.eu/editorial_documents/e7ba3ed0-4401-499b-ae5e-6051ebe45903" target="_blank">obtained by POLITICO</a>, Letta says that “Europe cannot, and should not, cede its role as a manufacturing leader to others.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Risky investments</h3>



<p>In typical EU style, Letta&#8217;s report is one of two significant studies written by former Italian prime ministers on similar subjects at the same time. Mario Draghi ― who led his homeland seven years after Letta before resigning in 2022 ― has been asked to explore Europe&#8217;s &#8220;competitiveness&#8221; by the European Commission.</p>



<p>In his report, Letta suggests there should be wider use of EU laws that governments must apply to the letter — rather than being able to make changes to them, which can lead to a confusing patchwork of requirements. He also proposes a European Code of Business Law to streamline administration for companies.</p>



<p>The former prime minister said he also wants to build on the Important Projects of Common European Interest model which combines national subsidies to boost key technologies, and an Enlargement Solidarity Facility to facilitate a smooth EU entry for new members.</p>



<p>To help fund all its new goals, the EU needs a common financial market — a Saving and Investment Union — his report says, which can channel EU citizens’ savings to support businesses. </p>



<p>“In Europe, there is not an interest in investing in the private equity, and there is not a big interest in having risky investments,” Letta said, recommending incentives to attract investment firstly for the green and the digital transition.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Defense bonds</h3>



<p>The report has a strong focus on integrating the energy, telecommunications, and finance industries with a roadmap to achieve progress in each sector by 2029. That could mean&nbsp;<a href="https://y3r710.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fdmp.politico.eu%2F%3Femail=jroberts@politico.eu%26destination=https:%2F%2Fpro.politico.eu%2Fnews%2F178527/1/0102018ee547520c-88d0e234-aece-4c03-a15d-732f53da9fde-000000/19y72OilAiQHh39PZIgyCucqWYw=369" target="_blank">allowing more dealmaking</a>, he said, a frequent demand by telecoms providers.</p>



<p>The money the EU will spend to improve its security should support “jobs and industries in Europe,” the report said. One of Letta’s advisers said he is supportive of defense bonds, already touted by internal market chief Thierry Breton and Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas.</p>



<p>Once leaders have discussed the report this week, they will give directions on how much of it they want to see the Commission and European Parliament take on after the European elections in June and the formation of the new executive at the end of the year.</p>
