					<description><![CDATA[The president conveyed his grief in a call.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President Joe Biden called chef José Andrés on Tuesday after an Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed seven aid workers with Andrés’ World Central Kitchen.</p>



<p>The White House’s readout of the call came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that an “unintentional” Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed workers with the U.S.-based nonprofit that provides meals to civilians amid conflict and natural disasters. The charity has since halted delivery of vital food aid to Gaza, as the humanitarian crisis in the region worsens.</p>



<p>Biden “conveyed” his grief in the call and recognized the “tremendous contribution” of the organization, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at Tuesday’s press briefing.</p>



<p>National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby, who also appeared at the briefing on Tuesday, said the U.S. is calling for a broader investigation and for the results to be released publicly.</p>



<p>“We were outraged to learn of an IDF strike that killed a number of civilian humanitarian officers yesterday from the World Central Kitchen, which has been relentless in working to get food to those who are hungry in Gaza,” Kirby said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Having vowed to not work with the far right, his minority government will need Socialist Party support to pass legislation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Center-right leader <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/portugal-luis-montenegro-invited-marcelo-rebelo-sousa-form-government/">Luís Montenegro</a> was sworn in as Portugal&#8217;s new prime minister in Lisbon&#8217;s Ajuda Palace on Tuesday, ushering in a minority government that will have difficulty passing legislation in the country&#8217;s fractured parliament.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Portuguese people voted for political change,&#8221; Montenegro said. &#8220;Our intention is to respect their will &#8230; And to be focused on solving the people&#8217;s problems .&#8221;</p>



<p>The new prime minister promised to lower taxes for the middle class and foster friendlier conditions for business, with the ultimate aim of luring back<strong> </strong>the nearly one-third of Portugal&#8217;s younger citizens who have migrated abroad in search of better-paying jobs. He added that he would also seek to carry out structural reforms to guarantee the survival of the country&#8217;s public services and implement measures to address the housing crisis.</p>



<p>Montenegro additionally said his government would seek to present a comprehensive plan to fight corruption and make the Portuguese government more transparent. The announcement comes six months after his predecessor, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/antonio-costa-portugal-election-2024-european-council-last-deal/">António Costa</a>, resigned after his official residence was <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/portugal-prime-minister-antonio-costa-resigns/">raided</a> by police in the midst of an influence-peddling probe.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s unclear how Montenegro&#8217;s Democratic Alliance coalition will pass the bills needed to make his promises a reality. While the center right <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/portugal-election-democratic-alliance-right-luis-montenegro-far-right/">narrowly won</a> last month&#8217;s snap national election, it fell far short of securing the 116 seats required to form a governing majority in the Portuguese parliament.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the far-right Chega party <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/portugal-far-right-back-democratic-alliance-chega-antonio-costa/">performed above expectations</a> to net 50 of the legislative body&#8217;s 230 seats. Because Montenegro has vowed to not make any deals with Chega, his Democratic Alliance will be obliged to seek support from the Socialist Party, which has governed the country for the past eight years.</p>



<p>Piecemeal agreements between the country&#8217;s two largest parties appear possible. After Chega refused to back the center-right candidate to preside over the Portuguese parliament last week, Montenegro&#8217;s lawmakers were able to forge a deal with their center-left counterparts to split the speakership, with each party&#8217;s candidate serving as speaker for two years.</p>



<p>Similarly, Socialist leader <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/meet-pedro-nuno-santos-man-fighting-keep-portugal-swing-right/">Pedro Nuno Santos</a> has indicated that he is open to helping the new minority government amend the country&#8217;s budget to increase funding for teachers, police and healthcare workers.</p>



<p>But long-term collaboration appears unlikely. Santos has made clear that he has no intention of serving as Montenegro&#8217;s crutch, and the left wing of the Socialist Party is unlikely to lend its support to the center-right&#8217;s budget proposal for 2025.</p>



<p>In 2022, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa dissolved parliament and called <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/portugal-headed-for-snap-election-marcelo-rebelo-de-sousa/">snap elections</a> after Prime Minister António Costa&#8217;s budget proposal was <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/portugal-government-elections-socialist-party-antonio-costa-chega-party-politics/">rejected</a> by a majority of lawmakers.</p>



<p>But Rebelo de Sousa has expressed no desire to send voters back to the polls before his mandate expires in 2026, and he&#8217;s likely to push the country&#8217;s centrist parties to work together to avoid an electoral scenario in which the far right could make further gains by campaigning against ineffective mainstream political forces. </p>



<p>After swearing Montenegro in, Rebelo de Sousa said that although Portuguese electors had chosen to &#8220;switch hemispheres&#8221; after 8 years of Socialist Party rule and entrust the government to the center-right instead of the center-left, they had also deliberately chosen &#8220;the moderates over the radicals.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You have the backing of the President of the Republic,&#8221; Rebelo de Sousa told Montenegro. &#8220;But you lack that backing in the parliament, and you will have to achieve it by building consensus.&#8221;</p>



<p>Montenegro, for his part, challenged the Socialist Party to decide whether it would work with his government to pass legislation that would benefit the general public, or whether it would vote with the far-right in order to reject its proposals.</p>



<p>&#8220;You must be clear about whether you want to be part of the democratic opposition, or if you want to help block democracy,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The new government has a distinctly EU flavor: Four of the cabinet&#8217;s 17 ministers were drafted from the European Parliament, among them European People&#8217;s Party Vice President <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/portuguese-people-to-know-brussels-bubble-eu-presidency/">Paulo Rangel</a>, who has been named foreign minister.</p>



<p>Montenegro&#8217;s chief of staff, diplomat Pedro Perestrelo Pinto, is also a Brussels veteran who previously served in Portugal&#8217;s Permanent Representation to the EU. </p>



<p>The selection has been interpreted as a sign that the new prime minister wants to underscore Portugal&#8217;s pro-European positions and further strengthen Lisbon&#8217;s relationship with Brussels.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[U.S. Secretary of State says Israel must "do more" to protect civilians.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>PARIS&nbsp; — The U.S. has urged a speedy and independent investigation into an Israeli strike that killed seven staff members of the U.S.-based charity World Central Kitchen in the Gaza Strip on April 1, and called on Israel to do more to protect civilian lives.</p>



<p>&#8220;The victims of yesterday&#8217;s strike join a record number of humanitarian workers killed in this conflict,&#8221; Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a press conference in Paris on Tuesday. &#8220;We urge a swift, thorough and impartial investigation to understand exactly what happened,&#8221; he said alongside his French counterpart, Stéphane Séjourné.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have impressed upon the Israelis the imperative to do more to protect innocent civilian lives, be they innocent Palestinian children &#8230; or aid workers,&#8221; he continued.</p>



<p>Israel&#8217;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/seven-aid-workers-uk-poland-killed-gaza-strike-idf-israel-world-central-kitchen/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/seven-aid-workers-uk-poland-killed-gaza-strike-idf-israel-world-central-kitchen/">admitted</a> on Tuesday that an “unintentional” Israeli airstrike had killed “innocent people” in Gaza after seven workers from World Central Kitchen were bombed.</p>



<p>The aid organization said the dead included Australian, Polish and British citizens.</p>



<p>Blinken is in Paris at the start of a four-day European tour that will also take him to Brussels and Louvain in Belgium, where he will join a meeting of NATO foreign ministers and an EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council summit.</p>



<p>Blinken&#8217;s visit to Europe also follows a suspected Israeli strike on Iran&#8217;s consulate in Damascus on Monday, which killed several senior commanders in what is seen as an escalation of Israel&#8217;s war against its regional foes.</p>



<p>Both Blinken and Séjourné refrained from attributing responsibility for Monday&#8217;s strike. Séjourné said France was working to &#8220;prevent a regional escalation&#8221; and that the &#8220;responsibility for disruption rests entirely&#8221; on &#8220;regional actors&#8221; who are seeking to extend the conflict against Israel. Blinken, meanwhile, said the U.S. &#8220;was trying to understand exactly what happened.&#8221;</p>



<p>Since the start of Israel&#8217;s war against the Hamas militant group six months ago, clashes have increased on the border between Israel and Lebanon, where Iran-backed Hezbollah activists have escalated their rocket strikes into Israel. Iran also backs Hamas in the Gaza Strip as well as Houthi rebels in Yemen.</p>



<p>The region is now braced for an expected retaliation by Iran against Israel or American bases in the region, analysts say. Israel, which rarely acknowledges strikes against Iranian targets, said it had no comment on the attacks on the Iranian embassy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said on Tuesday that his country will take revenge on Israel after the deadly consulate explosion, which Tehran officials immediately blamed on Israel.</p>



<p>“This unfair crime won’t go unanswered,” Raisi&nbsp;<a href="https://pfseb726.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.tasnimnews.com%2Fen%2Fnews%2F2024%2F04%2F02%2F3061995%2Fisraeli-attack-won-t-go-unanswered-iran-s-president/1/0102018e9e896d5a-4b4aa53e-9d4c-44a3-806a-d59fef9d88df-000000/nieNMoJHCfx-fkhZxgxeneSVwrM=367" target="_blank">said</a>,&nbsp;according to Iran’s Tasnim news agency.</p>



<p>Israel has so far not commented on Iran’s allegations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Upping arms production</h2>



<p>On Tuesday Blinken also visited a arms production site belonging to French manufacturer Nexter, where French Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu said production targets would be increased to respond to Ukrainian demand and defense spending increases in Europe.</p>



<p>Nexter will produce 12 Caesar self-propelled howitzers a month, up from two before the war in Ukraine started, he said Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Caesar cannon has become the symbol of the artillery coalition [for Ukraine], with a significant increase in production capacity: two per month, now six per month,” he said, speaking alongside Blinken.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Europe is under even greater pressure to arm Ukraine and finance the war effort as a $60 billion U.S. aid package remains stuck due to Republican opposition in Congress.</p>



<p>Blinken is also expected to meet French president Emmanuel Macron at the Elysée Palace on Tuesday evening.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[British prime minister hits out as Israeli ambassador summoned over World Central Kitchen bombing. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LONDON — U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak warned his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu that the situation in Gaza is &#8220;increasingly intolerable&#8221; and condemned the &#8220;appalling&#8221; killing of aid workers, including three British nationals, in an airstrike in Gaza.</p>



<p>A statement from Sunak&#8217;s office, issued Tuesday night, signaled the deepest split yet between Israel and the United Kingdom, which has continued to stress its support for the country in the wake of the deadly Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas last year.</p>



<p>But London summoned Israel&#8217;s ambassador and demanded an investigation in the aftermath of the killing of seven workers from the World Central Kitchen aid organization.</p>



<p>A statement from the group — which said its aid convoy was  hit “despite coordinating movements&#8221; with the Israel Defense Forces — said the dead included Australian, Polish and British citizens.</p>



<p>A readout of a Tuesday night call between Netanyahu and Sunak, provided by No. 10 Downing Street, said Sunak had told his Israeli opposite number he was &#8220;appalled by the killing of aid workers, including three British nationals, in an airstrike in Gaza yesterday and demanded a thorough and transparent independent investigation into what happened.&#8221;</p>



<p>“The prime minister said far too many aid workers and ordinary civilians have lost their lives in Gaza and the situation is increasingly intolerable,&#8221; the statement continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;The U.K. expects to see immediate action by Israel to end restrictions on humanitarian aid, deconflict with the U.N. and aid agencies, protect civilians and repair vital infrastructure like hospitals and water networks.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sunak, per his office, &#8220;reiterated that Israel’s rightful aim of defeating Hamas would not be achieved by allowing a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.&#8221;</p>



<p>World Central Kitchen has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/aid-sent-via-cyprus-sea-corridor-reaches-gaza-population/">provided hundreds of tons of humanitarian aid</a>&nbsp;to starving Gazans.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;Unequivocal condemnation&#8217;</h3>



<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Foreign Secretary David Cameron had called his Israeli counterpart to urge an investigation into the incident. Junior minister Andrew Mitchell meanwhile summoned Tzipi Hotovely, Israel&#8217;s ambassador to the U.K., to a meeting in the Foreign Office in which he &#8220;set out the government’s unequivocal condemnation of the appalling killing of 7 World Central Kitchen aid workers, including 3 British nationals.&#8221;</p>

<p>The comments from the top U.K. politicians signal a notable hardening in tone, and came as the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/blinken-calls-swift-impartial-investigation-killing-aid-workers-gaza/">U.S. government too urged a speedy and independent</a> investigation into the April 1 Israeli strike in the Gaza Strip. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/blinken-calls-swift-impartial-investigation-killing-aid-workers-gaza/">on a trip to Paris</a>, called on Israel to do more to protect civilian lives.</p>



<p>Australia&#8217;s Anthony Albanese meanwhile&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/anthony-albanese-demands-accountability-from-israel-over-death-of-aid-worker-in-gaza/0ms3lvr2g" target="_blank">expressed his own anger at what he called the &#8220;completely unacceptable&#8221;</a> killing of  43-year-old Australian aid worker Lalzawmi Frankcom in the same bombing. Albanese too summoned the Israeli ambassador.</p>



<p>On Tuesday <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/seven-aid-workers-uk-poland-killed-gaza-strike-idf-israel-world-central-kitchen/">Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu&nbsp;admitted</a> &#8220;innocent people&#8221; had been killed in the &#8220;unintentional&#8221; airstrike.</p>



<p>“It happens in war, we check it to the end, we are in contact with the governments, and we will do everything so that this thing does not happen again,&#8221; he vowed.</p>



<p>World Central Kitchen said it had paused its operations &#8220;immediately&#8221; following the bombing.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[During the NATO foreign ministerial meeting, officials are expected to discuss gradually moving the organization — called the Ukraine Defense Contact Group — into the alliance’s control.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. and other Western countries are considering transferring to NATO a U.S.-led multinational group that coordinates the shipment of weapons to Ukraine, a move that could help maintain the flow of arms to Kyiv under a second Donald Trump presidency.</p>



<p>During the NATO foreign ministerial meeting in Brussels Wednesday and Thursday, officials are expected to discuss gradually moving the organization — called the Ukraine Defense Contact Group — into the alliance’s control, according to three European officials and a U.S. official with knowledge of the internal deliberations. The goal would be to finalize the move at the NATO leaders’ summit in Washington in July, one of the officials said.</p>



<p>Allies see the shift as a way to institutionalize the U.S.-led effort, allowing other countries in NATO to have a bigger say over the process in case of a Trump re-election, according to one of the European officials. All of the people were granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[“No joke.”]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Botswana’s President Mokgweetsi Masisi has threatened to send 20,000 elephants to Germany as the countries argue over the import of hunting trophies. </p>



<p>“No joke,” he <a href="https://www.bild.de/politik/ausland/politik-ausland/botswana-will-20-000-elefanten-nach-deutschland-abschieben-87716972.bild.html" target="_blank">told the<strong> </strong>German tabloid BILD</a> on Tuesday.</p>



<p>Masisi attacked the German federal government, and the environment ministry in particular, led by Green minister Steffi Lemke, for seeking to ban the import of trophies despite Botswana&#8217;s overpopulation of elephants.</p>



<p>“It is very easy to sit in Berlin and have an opinion about our affairs in Botswana. We are paying the price for preserving these animals for the world,” he said.</p>



<p>Botswana, home to about 130,000 elephants according to the president, has sent 8,000 to Angola already. “We would also like to make such an offer to the Federal Republic of Germany,” announced Masisi. “We won’t take no for an answer.”</p>



<p>“We want our elephants to roam freely. The German weather is bad enough for them,” he added. “If you like them so much, then please accept this gift from us.”</p>

<p>Officials from the southern African country already protested a potential U.K. ban on safari hunters importing trophies, warning in March they would send 10,000 <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/03/21/botswana-threatens-send-10-000-elephants-hyde-park-trophy-hunting-row-20502931/" target="_blank">elephants to Hyde Park</a> in London.</p>



<p>The animal rights organization PETA supports Lemke’s plans to restrict and possibly ban the import, calling trophy hunting “a hobby of rich, jaded people who have more money than morals.&#8221;</p>



<p>“The horrendous sums that amateur hunters spend on a hunting trip do not end up with the poor population or with a national park administration, but almost exclusively in the pockets of tour operators and hunting farm owners,” a PETA spokesperson told POLITICO.</p>



<p>Botswana should ban trophy hunting entirely and instead rely on photo tourism to generate revenue, the spokesperson added, pointing out that living animals would do more for the country’s image.</p>



<p>Botswana’s president described his country&#8217;s elephant situation as serious. Elephants were trampling people to death, crops were destroyed and villages devastated.</p>



<p>He also invited the minister to inspect wildlife protection in Botswana. His country does more “than any other country in the world,” he stressed, adding that a move to ban importing trophies would worsen poverty.</p>



<p>Germany’s Federal Ministry for the Environment said that Botswana has “not yet contacted them on this matter”, but that Lemke has “signaled that she will accept Botswana&#8217;s invitation if an opportunity arises” to inspect wildlife protection in the southern African country.</p>



<p>The German Association for Animal Welfare called the government’s plans “long overdue” and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/2022_Verbaende_Mythenpapier_Trophaeenjagd.pdf">shared a 2022 report</a> with POLITICO, which argues that such hunts, in fact, exacerbate existing inequalities within society instead of diminishing them.  </p>



<p>Germany is one of the largest importers of hunting trophies in the EU.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Dutch PM wins high-profile endorsement. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas — herself an unofficial candidate for NATO&#8217;s top job — said Tuesday she backs her Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte for the secretary-general post. </p>



<p>&#8220;For a strong NATO, we need to be clear-eyed on Russia, boost deterrence and defence spending, back Ukraine&#8217;s membership, and geographic balance,&#8221; she said <a href="https://x.com/kajakallas/status/1775154452971806897?s=20" target="_blank">in a statement</a> posted on social media. </p>



<p>&#8220;I have discussed this in depth with Mark Rutte and he commits to these priorities. Estonia can back him for NATO&#8217;s Secretary General,&#8221; Kallas added. </p>



<p>Her backing is a major win for Rutte, who has been struggling to get support beyond Western Europe and North America. </p>



<p>NATO, <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/11/07/emmanuel-macron-warns-europe-nato-is-becoming-brain-dead" target="_blank">declared &#8220;brain dead&#8221;</a> by French President Emmanuel Macron back in 2019, has regained importance thanks to Russia&#8217;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, welcoming two new members — Sweden and Finland —&nbsp;in recent months. </p>



<p>However, a potential return of NATO-skeptic former U.S. President Donald Trump to the White House has raised fears in Europe that Washington could disengage from the military alliance and Europe&#8217;s security. </p>



<p>Earlier Tuesday, Kallas <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/estonian-prime-minister-kaja-kallas-forced-deny-viral-april-fools-nato-joke/">had to shoot down</a> an April Fools&#8217; hoax which said she had the support of heavyweights including the United States, France, Germany and the United Kingdom to lead NATO. </p>



<p>Rutte&#8217;s path to the job became clearer when one of his rivals, Latvian Foreign Minister Krišjānis Kariņš, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/krisjanis-karins-latvia-foreign-minister-quits-amid-flight-spending-scandal/">had to resign</a> because of a flight spending scandal.</p>



<p>But Rutte still faces competition from Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/romania-president-klaus-iohannis-launch-nato-top-job-bid-mark-rutte/">who announced</a> a surprise bid last month, arguing NATO would benefit from the perspective of Eastern Europe. </p>



<p>Over the weekend, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/177879" target="_blank">spelled out</a> his conditions to support Rutte&#8217;s bid,&nbsp;which include having the “sensitivities” of non-EU countries taken into account. <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/176606" target="_blank">Hungary currently opposes</a> the Dutch leader&#8217;s candidacy.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Not true," sighed Estonian prime minister.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas shot down an April Fools’ hoax which said she had “won the backing of the United States, France, Germany and the United Kingdom to become the next secretary general of NATO.”</p>



<p>The joke, which went viral after first being <a href="https://estonianworld.com/security/estonian-pm-kaja-kallas-to-become-new-nato-chief/" target="_blank">published</a> by Estonian World — a London-based online magazine writing about Estonians around the world — also noted that Kallas would be the first woman and the first from Central and Eastern Europe to lead the military alliance.</p>



<p>Congratulations poured in, with one prominent commentator, historian Timothy Garton Ash, said on X (formerly Twitter) that “this is excellent news — and sends an important message to Putin&#8217;s Russia … ” (his <a href="https://twitter.com/fromTGA/status/1775066206770192888" target="_blank">post</a> is no longer available).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="1002" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/share_8709334010630165216-1024x1002.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4527363" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/share_8709334010630165216.png 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/share_8709334010630165216.png 300w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1080,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/share_8709334010630165216.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Shortly afterwards, Kallas stepped in to quell the tsunami of gullibility, <a href="https://twitter.com/kajakallas/status/1775066928752603487" target="_blank">replying to Garton Ash</a>, “This was somebody’s April fools joke. Not true.”</p>



<p>Last month, Kallas jokingly denied that she ate “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/estonia-kaja-kallas-i-dont-eat-russians-for-breakfast-rather-muesli-yogurt-blueberries/">Russians for breakfast</a>,” after one anonymous European Union official had attributed unbending anti-Moscow positions to her. </p>



<p>“The fact that this April fools joke generated so much attention and support shows the strong voice of&nbsp; Kaja Kallas&nbsp; on the European strategic scene,” <a href="https://twitter.com/camille_grand/status/1775116934410830029?t=MnZCa-G8SuYIG6xkLpol3g&amp;s=19" target="_blank">said</a> former top NATO official Camille Grand on X.</p>



<p>Silver Tambur, a publisher at Estonian World, told POLITICO&nbsp;the article&#8217;s aim was to increase public attention for Kallas&#8217; NATO bid. “That was part of what we wanted to do, and I am happy about the attention the story got,” he said.</p>



<p>Speaking at the POLITICO Defense Summit in November, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/14/estonian-pm-kaja-kallas-open-nato-chief-00127094" target="_blank">Kallas said she was interested in</a> taking over the top job at NATO as the Cold War-era alliance continues to navigate Russia’s war in Ukraine, along with homing in on common strategies against China and other emerging threats.</p>



<p>The term of current NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, who led the military alliance since 2014, will end in October this year.</p>



<p>The new head of NATO will be appointed this summer and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte is in pole position to take over the job after&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/mark-rutte-pole-position-next-nato-boss/">receiving endorsement</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/21/biden-backs-dutch-pm-mark-rutte-for-top-nato-job-00142554" target="_blank">Washington</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-france-join-us-and-uk-in-backing-mark-rutte-for-top-nato-job/">London, Paris and Berlin</a>.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Increasing exports to the EU are a lifeline for Turkey, but analysts fear it could be the Kremlin cashing in.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Turkey&#8217;s landmark gas deal with Hungary is giving Budapest a much-needed energy lifeline — but may be opening a new backdoor for Russia to re-establish its grip on Europe&#8217;s power systems, analysts warn.</p>



<p>Hungary has been searching for new gas sources as it nears the end of a deal that brings the country around 4.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas each year via Ukrainian pipelines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And on Monday, it took a step toward doing just that, receiving the first gas deliveries via a new agreement with Turkey, according to Hungary&#8217;s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the terms of a contract <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/energy/international-relations/turkiye-signs-deal-to-export-natural-gas-to-hungary/38748" target="_blank">signed</a> between Turkish state firm BOTAŞ and Hungary’s MVM CEEnergy in August last year, the EU member country will receive as much as 275 million cubic meters of natural gas in the coming weeks alone — more than all Hungarian households use for heating and cooking in the average month.</p>



<p>Speaking at an energy conference in Russia&#8217;s Black Sea city of Sochi last week, Budapest&#8217;s top diplomat <a href="https://www.facebook.com/szijjarto.peter.official/posts/945552753704685?ref=embed_post" target="_blank">hailed</a> the start of the scheme as a &#8220;historic day&#8221; that would strengthen ties with Ankara.</p>



<p>For Turkey, the pact also represents a chance to become a &#8220;gas hub&#8221; for all of Europe — <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-election-energy-recep-tayyip-erdogan-nuclear-gas-russia/">an ambition</a> Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has trumpeted in the face of <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/end-recep-tayyip-erdogan-economics-turkey-double-interest-rate-inflation/">runaway inflation</a> and<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-election-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-suffers-blow-as-opposition-rpp-holds-five-cities/"> growing public discontent</a>. While Turkey currently supplies Bulgaria with up to 1.85 billion cubic meters of gas per year, the deal with Budapest is the first time Turkey has exported gas beyond its direct neighbors.</p>



<p>Yet there are concerns that the gas Turkey is shipping to Europe could actually be from Russia, just as EU nations work to end their dependency on Moscow. Turkey is largely dependent on imports itself and, although a member of the NATO military alliance, Ankara has refused to impose Western-led sanctions on Moscow and has vowed to increase its energy trade with Russia.</p>



<p>&#8220;Turkey wouldn’t be able to have such cheap gas prices if it came from somewhere else apart from Russia,” said Aura Sabadus, an associate fellow of the Royal United Services Institute and analyst with commodities experts ICIS. </p>



<p>Hungary is also one of Europe’s cheapest gas markets because of its discounted Russian gas purchases.</p>



<p>Hungary, however, needs fresh gas sources. Ukraine has insisted — and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-warns-it-wont-negotiate-new-russian-gas-transit-deal/">confirmed to POLITICO</a> — that it will not renew a deal with Moscow&#8217;s state energy giant, Gazprom, to let gas flow via its territory when the agreement expires in January.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Replacing that route with gas via Turkey has<a href="https://hungarytoday.hu/ukraines-naftogaz-is-preparing-to-stop-the-transit-of-russian-gas-to-europe/" target="_blank"> long been an option</a> for Budapest, and one that would make the true origins of the fuel virtually impossible to find out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, Moscow&#8217;s supplies are not explicitly banned by sanctions — the Kremlin decided to turn off the majority of flows to the EU <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/putins-gas-problem/">to punish the bloc</a> for supporting the defense of Ukraine.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/GettyImages-1399160240-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4526802" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/GettyImages-1399160240.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/02/GettyImages-1399160240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hungary is also one of Europe’s cheapest gas markets because of its discounted Russian gas purchases | Janos Kummer/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>“There is no rationale” for Brussels to step in over the issue, Sabadus noted, adding: “Traders don’t seem to have any qualms about taking Russian gas.”</p>



<p>A senior EU official, granted anonymity to speak about the sensitive issue, told POLITICO the European Commission is &#8220;following Turkey’s plan to open a gas hub very closely.” But the official added that buying Russian gas via another country is allowed under current sanctions rules.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hungary&#8217;s Ministry of National Development did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>Budapest has consistently opposed tougher restrictions on Russian energy, including on the civilian nuclear sector, and has actually increased energy links with Moscow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moscow&#8217;s state firm Rosatom is helping build a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-approves-construction-of-russian-built-nuclear-reactors/">major new nuclear power station</a> near Paks in southern Hungary. And Szijjártó&#8217;s trip to Russia last week saw him speak at an atomic energy conference, praising Turkey&#8217;s decision to also rely on Rosatom to build its new Akkuyu nuclear plant. </p>



<p>Those moves have come despite Ukraine urging Western nations to end their reliance on Moscow, given repeated warnings its soldiers are risking disaster by stationing troops and weaponry at  Europe&#8217;s largest nuclear power plant in occupied Zaporizhzhia.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[“This unfair crime won’t go unanswered,” Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi warned.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi&nbsp;on Tuesday said his country will take revenge on Israel after a deadly explosion at the Iranian consulate in Damascus on Monday, which Tehran officials immediately blamed on Israel.</p>



<p>Six people are&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1403/01/13/3061796/%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%AF%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B3%D9%BE%D8%A7%D9%87-%D9%82%D8%AF%D8%B3-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%AA-%D8%B1%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%82" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;to have died in the strike, including Mohammad Reza Zahedi, an officer in an elite unit of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p>



<p>“This unfair crime won’t go unanswered,” Raisi <a href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2024/04/02/3061995/israeli-attack-won-t-go-unanswered-iran-s-president" target="_blank">said</a> according to Iran&#8217;s Tasnim news agency.</p>



<p>Israel has so far not commented on Iran&#8217;s allegations.</p>



<p>Israeli forces have&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-shifts-deadlier-strikes-iran-linked-targets-syria-2024-01-08/" target="_blank">repeatedly carried out airstrikes against Iranian targets in Syria</a>&nbsp;and Iran-backed Hezbollah militias in Lebanon since the start of its war against Tehran’s ally, Hamas, in Gaza after Palestinian militants killed 1,200 people and took hundreds of others hostage in a deadly attack on Oct. 7 last year.</p>



<p>On Monday, Iranian Ambassador to the U.N. Zahra Ershadi called on the U.N. Security Council to hold an emergency meeting, urging the body to condemn &#8220;this unjustified criminal act and terrorist act perpetrated by the Israel regime in the strongest terms possible,” <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-calls-for-un-security-council-meeting-after-israeli-airstrike-destroys-iranian-consulate-in-syria/7552953.html" target="_blank">according to</a> the U.S. public broadcaster VOA. An open U.N Security Council briefing regarding the matter is scheduled later Tuesday <a href="https://twitter.com/Dpol_un/status/1774964092031177092" target="_blank">according to</a> Dmitry Polyansky, a Russian U.N. representative.</p>



<p>According to Iranian state media, several diplomats were also killed, although the ambassador, Hossein Akbari, is&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nournews.ir/fa/news/169045/%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%B1%DA%98%DB%8C%D9%85-%D8%B5%D9%87%DB%8C%D9%88%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%B3%D8%AA%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86-%DA%A9%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%87-%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;to be unharmed.</p>
