					<description><![CDATA[It's the 30th anniversary of the humanitarian tragedy, which saw the mass murder of an estimated 800,000 people.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President Emmanuel Macron will apologize for France’s failure to stop the Rwanda genocide on the 30th anniversary of the humanitarian disaster, according to <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2024/04/04/rwanda-pour-emmanuel-macron-la-france-aurait-pu-arreter-le-genocide-mais-n-en-a-pas-eu-la-volonte_6225974_3212.html" target="_blank">French media</a>.</p>



<p>In a video message to be published on social media Sunday, <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2024/04/04/rwanda-pour-emmanuel-macron-la-france-aurait-pu-arreter-le-genocide-mais-n-en-a-pas-eu-la-volonte_6225974_3212.html" target="_blank">Macron will acknowledge</a> that “France, which could have stopped the genocide with its Western and African allies, did not have the will to do so.”</p>



<p>Sunday marks three decades since the start of the Rwanda genocide, which saw the mass murder of an estimated 800,000 people, mainly members of the Tutsi ethnic minority, by Hutu militants between April and July 1994.</p>



<p>Macron was invited to a ceremony in the Rwandan capital Kigali commemorating the anniversary of the genocide but will not attend. France will instead be represented by Foreign Affairs Minister Stéphane Séjourné and Rwandan-born genocide survivor Hervé Berville, the secretary of state for the sea.</p>



<p>The genocide has long been a source of tension between France and Rwanda. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/world/africa/france-rwanda-genocide-report.html" target="_blank">report commissioned by the Rwandan government</a> and published in 2021 found France played a “significant” role in “enabling” the bloodshed with its support of Rwanda’s regime.</p>

<p>A month after the report&#8217;s findings, Macron visited the Kigali Genocide Memorial honoring victims and gave <a href="https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/rwanda/news/article/rwanda-speech-by-president-emmanuel-macron-at-the-kigali-genocide-memorial" target="_blank">a speech</a> in which he acknowledged France&#8217;s “responsibilities” but stopped short of an official apology, insisting his country “was not an accomplice” to the violence.</p>



<p>Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who invited Macron to Sunday’s ceremony, <a href="https://www.jeuneafrique.com/1548551/politique/paul-kagame-tshisekedi-est-capable-de-tout-sauf-de-mesurer-les-consequences-de-ce-quil-dit/" target="_blank">appeared unperturbed by his French counterpart&#8217;s planned absence</a>, telling a French-language pan-African publication last month that Paris can “send whoever they want.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[“I don’t know why they released wartime shots like that. I guess it makes them look tough. But to me, it doesn’t make them look tough,” Trump said.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For the second time in two weeks, Donald Trump on Thursday unloaded on Israel.</p>



<p>The former president has long cast himself as a stalwart defender of Israel. But on Thursday, he said Israel was “losing the PR war” in its handling of the war in Gaza because of its posts to social media showing images of destruction.</p>



<p>“And the other thing is I hate, they put out tapes all the time. Every night, they’re releasing tapes of a building falling down,” Trump said in an interview with conservative radio host&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hughhewitt.com/former-president-donald-trump-on-israels-war-2024-and-much-more" target="_blank">Hugh Hewitt</a>. “They shouldn’t be releasing tapes like that. They’re doing, that’s why they’re losing the PR war. They, Israel, is absolutely losing the PR war.”<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://eb2.3lift.com/pass?tl_clickthrough=true&amp;redir=https%3A%2F%2Frtb-us-west.linkedin.com%2Flax%2Fclk%3Ftrk%3DCwEAAAGOrCChvhXUdeEpb3lEQihiGMLtjGtJh3aFhnvtiFMAtMhrIoTSGXNeCpqhgkg3_X1QcDQ7I0Og1LlbOwhz4MPqhdXnKGAaVtTyIhum5f6iP1wgl0w5-L9RAunOkKA3Pwo_pQjP-Gd3v6Z7m5Fzdqygp1sTD4gRiJSo9xbbpqcQGXwVn-IScbVtC-gmhmTG8b5-xeuxI1T0vWC0YUhdOFaXyiuAPi8k7-ws3YB3Ib3tfXhF2tOkufiKaJRJ6rzOXwGMSmJlAIrMVR5FpleW3FjBOD3SVHiLvaUicVX7bil0WUpDwF5sxChF7-eG0D8GheiH-jbkD277Wi9SlLfyaw8tW8l3e3dADOtOFF9IaTJtUCch5tUt8kkEyd3K-kMNTNhmm0WuaUuJDSCQZ5G8YVdhn1ssq10K-pkBaDqKk_hEZZxQQ535EprDVruwHo1lgNRp8eM3VtP0RGwCk7BEIX_Jg4QlWCH7k7SbINDJgSKjZUPlElKRYm0KAdHnQ934QgcBhTgxAJZUs7GqWjGabfq9rs57Qy6qtZINzDlLHujB51T6amttpK0pKhKiWkXlMms8J50O5jf49im08Pm0yRP978C8Guhg_1bSLyZxJ4ee9626iDiTjqRJ25_5NQUXseuAjF9W4p0TyCzH88nTzYwm3zb5T42K8uM8PIl1BScme4F0N1mfXRUXvCBfchGSf31wTrrYYhtrFv3fi2Qyc1jvcKnDniPO20464MWg01TTHlxemL51OuUidDU_spCBNtXddF2HRHcYnNiiDzUo9Nox-K6OEL1Ni-1UvRW_w7FH2alDccyIHtPvtwSCfKO4iXn5loJE-IlEYe3pQPUxox_W-M7li6A1eI0nL9lod3qDOs35Z1vUjmPIsSavi8diM5o1n_Av2cTmgxCDHFY0QbztFTBWLlZNzSXp8daBgbgxQsGLivq7eeHtLtbMCOfunjMg_IIA4lA1s0M7y2KOkRkJCvQUE904bnR8g2jPcTmiFtF6PvnK2j3SwSt4AHVi1tTpElmJAN4v_PF3Pg04jyFxBGuk2ulaj4uFLv5vWlHpZB0xhc_XG3TOD7pRWz5-NAVGJ63yRN6bYzUAL9E0GQ8yaomUgLfEu40k5TnCcYxnupvp1-nqhlZ6Eae9OqH0DaDGgH5RZYpl9ljBPuggrS7R1QJlVyvnXb1LZ9arvwtYRVx0X6yyT6HuKeXAxVBLBwA4ymmUmQfdfOP1A21X7xkdX5UbwwMUgW1swwoKYYjxV_HV3pD9evOgrx6COjXWywQE5Sx5tIxxKBTlI04zpYiTPKcxESu65krvObnix4rGpLLbcXLvB4Iziu6_J6b9_we9c2dRFURB4s1aLWVJimOKarfNqMgZZQue8WdxheX1D6rsRcsZ38NS_HQGnWgQiJVDdHRMVOGe82l4rrCTHk90Yp2w0UWlsPPQwhGMBBSdvoX8GT9h7nZF1CYgDtV8ahLsWPpe-php1N1SIaRisLf43ZcPKsSE5szWvNYFpbCy22b12FqolVALINQpaOD083ToqwJSc5vV1WXjOaCletJ8bYMN1jMN%26action%3Dclick%26laxrid%3D8c838aac-a6be-4901-bfa2-7d92bb699949%26laxbid%3D2%26eid%3D3%26crtype%3Dvid%26laxerid%3D1319399462613973065627-188%26adfmt%3D6%26wp%3D%24%7BTL_AUCTION_PRICE%7D%26urle%3DCwEAAAGOrCChwM4XbnUdqVR3Wvxx_Eidku84i0SC-nJNO6DyVhtD-_sUmZsWXChjoc5KqtuJv3ut_SGnun6jpYi5xES9teJYSA4G95mCFxdZZ2Nmvp8sdJjuiRDeSaVBAMqaw6cJNc_nH5rZ8A%26urlhash%3DH6dj&amp;pr=0.362&amp;bc=0.886&amp;aid=13193994626139730656271&amp;bmid=6250&amp;biid=6250&amp;sid=66552&amp;brid=556676&amp;adid=369307636&amp;crid=221381143&amp;ts=1712284803&amp;bcud=886&amp;ss=12&amp;cb=15473" target="_blank"></a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://eb2.3lift.com/pass?tl_clickthrough=true&amp;redir=https%3A%2F%2Frtb-us-west.linkedin.com%2Flax%2Fclk%3Ftrk%3DCwEAAAGOrCChvhXUdeEpb3lEQihiGMLtjGtJh3aFhnvtiFMAtMhrIoTSGXNeCpqhgkg3_X1QcDQ7I0Og1LlbOwhz4MPqhdXnKGAaVtTyIhum5f6iP1wgl0w5-L9RAunOkKA3Pwo_pQjP-Gd3v6Z7m5Fzdqygp1sTD4gRiJSo9xbbpqcQGXwVn-IScbVtC-gmhmTG8b5-xeuxI1T0vWC0YUhdOFaXyiuAPi8k7-ws3YB3Ib3tfXhF2tOkufiKaJRJ6rzOXwGMSmJlAIrMVR5FpleW3FjBOD3SVHiLvaUicVX7bil0WUpDwF5sxChF7-eG0D8GheiH-jbkD277Wi9SlLfyaw8tW8l3e3dADOtOFF9IaTJtUCch5tUt8kkEyd3K-kMNTNhmm0WuaUuJDSCQZ5G8YVdhn1ssq10K-pkBaDqKk_hEZZxQQ535EprDVruwHo1lgNRp8eM3VtP0RGwCk7BEIX_Jg4QlWCH7k7SbINDJgSKjZUPlElKRYm0KAdHnQ934QgcBhTgxAJZUs7GqWjGabfq9rs57Qy6qtZINzDlLHujB51T6amttpK0pKhKiWkXlMms8J50O5jf49im08Pm0yRP978C8Guhg_1bSLyZxJ4ee9626iDiTjqRJ25_5NQUXseuAjF9W4p0TyCzH88nTzYwm3zb5T42K8uM8PIl1BScme4F0N1mfXRUXvCBfchGSf31wTrrYYhtrFv3fi2Qyc1jvcKnDniPO20464MWg01TTHlxemL51OuUidDU_spCBNtXddF2HRHcYnNiiDzUo9Nox-K6OEL1Ni-1UvRW_w7FH2alDccyIHtPvtwSCfKO4iXn5loJE-IlEYe3pQPUxox_W-M7li6A1eI0nL9lod3qDOs35Z1vUjmPIsSavi8diM5o1n_Av2cTmgxCDHFY0QbztFTBWLlZNzSXp8daBgbgxQsGLivq7eeHtLtbMCOfunjMg_IIA4lA1s0M7y2KOkRkJCvQUE904bnR8g2jPcTmiFtF6PvnK2j3SwSt4AHVi1tTpElmJAN4v_PF3Pg04jyFxBGuk2ulaj4uFLv5vWlHpZB0xhc_XG3TOD7pRWz5-NAVGJ63yRN6bYzUAL9E0GQ8yaomUgLfEu40k5TnCcYxnupvp1-nqhlZ6Eae9OqH0DaDGgH5RZYpl9ljBPuggrS7R1QJlVyvnXb1LZ9arvwtYRVx0X6yyT6HuKeXAxVBLBwA4ymmUmQfdfOP1A21X7xkdX5UbwwMUgW1swwoKYYjxV_HV3pD9evOgrx6COjXWywQE5Sx5tIxxKBTlI04zpYiTPKcxESu65krvObnix4rGpLLbcXLvB4Iziu6_J6b9_we9c2dRFURB4s1aLWVJimOKarfNqMgZZQue8WdxheX1D6rsRcsZ38NS_HQGnWgQiJVDdHRMVOGe82l4rrCTHk90Yp2w0UWlsPPQwhGMBBSdvoX8GT9h7nZF1CYgDtV8ahLsWPpe-php1N1SIaRisLf43ZcPKsSE5szWvNYFpbCy22b12FqolVALINQpaOD083ToqwJSc5vV1WXjOaCletJ8bYMN1jMN%26action%3Dclick%26laxrid%3D8c838aac-a6be-4901-bfa2-7d92bb699949%26laxbid%3D2%26eid%3D3%26crtype%3Dvid%26laxerid%3D1319399462613973065627-188%26adfmt%3D6%26wp%3D%24%7BTL_AUCTION_PRICE%7D%26urle%3DCwEAAAGOrCChwM4XbnUdqVR3Wvxx_Eidku84i0SC-nJNO6DyVhtD-_sUmZsWXChjoc5KqtuJv3ut_SGnun6jpYi5xES9teJYSA4G95mCFxdZZ2Nmvp8sdJjuiRDeSaVBAMqaw6cJNc_nH5rZ8A%26urlhash%3DH6dj&amp;pr=0.362&amp;bc=0.886&amp;aid=13193994626139730656271&amp;bmid=6250&amp;biid=6250&amp;sid=66552&amp;brid=556676&amp;adid=369307636&amp;crid=221381143&amp;ts=1712284803&amp;bcud=886&amp;ss=12&amp;cb=15473" target="_blank"></a></p>

<p>Far from a one-off, Trump’s remarks reflect the solidifying of a more critical posture he is taking toward Israel, despite steadfast support for the country while he was president. During his tenure, Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to the contested city. Trump has boasted that he “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-16/trump-says-he-fought-for-israel-more-than-any-other-president" target="_blank">&nbsp;fought for Israel</a>&nbsp;like no president ever before.”</p>



<p>But in recent weeks, Trump has reiterated his criticisms of how Israel — and its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu — are handling the conflict. After the Oct. 7 Hamas assault on Israel, Trump said that Netanyahu had been unprepared for the attack. He also called the anti-Israel Lebanese militant group Hezbollah “very smart.”</p>



<p>And in an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/03/25/trump-to-israel-hayom-only-a-fool-would-have-not-acted-like-israel-on-oct-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview published late last month in Israel Hayom</a>, a news outlet whose publisher is Republican mega-donor Miriam Adelson, Trump said that Israel had made a “very big mistake” by broadcasting images of the war.</p>



<p>“I think that’s one of the reasons that there has been a lot of kickback. If people didn’t see that, every single night I’d watch and every single one of those,” Trump told the newspaper. “And I think Israel wanted to show that it’s tough, but sometimes you shouldn’t be doing that.”</p>



<p>Trump’s remarks on Thursday came after seven people died on Monday in an Israeli strike against a convoy from World Central Kitchen, an aid organization that provides meals to civilians suffering from hunger due to conflicts.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/seven-aid-workers-uk-poland-killed-gaza-strike-idf-israel-world-central-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netanyahu admitted that</a>&nbsp;an “unintentional” Israeli airstrike killed “innocent people” in Gaza, adding that “we will do everything so that this thing does not happen again.”</p>



<p>During his Thursday interview with Hewitt, Trump doubled down on his past remarks, saying that Israel was “releasing the most heinous, most horrible tapes of buildings falling down. And people are imagining there’s a lot of people in those buildings, or people in those buildings, and they don’t like it,” Trump said.</p>



<p>“I don’t know why they released wartime shots like that. I guess it makes them look tough. But to me, it doesn’t make them look tough,” Trump continued. “They’re losing the PR war. They’re losing it big. But they’ve got to finish what they started, and they’ve got to finish it fast, and we have to get on with life.”</p>



<p>When asked twice by Hewitt if Trump is “still standing 100 percent with Israel,” the former president did not answer the question directly.</p>



<p>Despite his criticisms, Trump has continued to cultivate the support of Israel’s most fiercest defenders. That includes Adelson, whom Trump has dined with several times in recent months. Adelson and her late husband, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, donated more than $100 million to Trump’s past campaigns, and she is widely expected to help him again in the 2024 election.</p>



<p>Matt Brooks, the chief executive officer of the Republican Jewish Coalition, argued that Trump’s position would not impact his standing with Jewish voters, given that Trump has said Israel should “<a href="https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/03/25/trump-to-israel-hayom-only-a-fool-would-have-not-acted-like-israel-on-oct-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;finish up your war” and “get the job done</a>.”</p>



<p>“Trump is giving the Israelis a blank check to finish the job and eliminate Hamas but be cognizant of the fact that time is not their ally and each day that passes public opinion is getting worse,” Brooks said. “He said exactly the same thing literally everyone in the Jewish community is saying right now.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[President of southern African country wants to offload elephants to Germany. Bring it on!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em style="font-size: revert;font-family: var(--font-family);color: var(--c-primary)"><em>Welcome to Declassified, a weekly humor column</em></em>.</p>



<p>If any political promise this year becomes reality, please let it be the president of Botswana <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/botswana-president-mokgweetsi-masisi-threatens-deport-20000-elephants-germany/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/botswana-president-mokgweetsi-masisi-threatens-deport-20000-elephants-germany/">releasing 20,000 elephants</a> into Germany!</p>



<p>Mokgweetsi Masisi is unhappy at the German government’s plan to ban the import of hunting trophies&nbsp;even though Botswana is home to some 130,000 elephants. </p>



<p>“It is very easy to sit in Berlin and have an opinion about our affairs in Botswana. We are paying the price for preserving these animals for the world,” the president of the southern African country said.</p>



<p>“We want our elephants to roam freely. The German weather is bad enough for them,” Masisi said. “If you like them so much, then please accept this gift from us.”</p>



<p>I think we can all agree that this would be wonderful. Angela Merkel could come out of retirement to utter <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-wir-schaffen-das-5-years-on/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-wir-schaffen-das-5-years-on/">those famous three little words</a> <em>“Wir schaffen das!” </em>as the first elephants parade through the Brandenburg Gate. Olaf Scholz could make sure he travels everywhere by elephant in an effort to seem even slightly interesting. The government could promise to send Ukraine some battle elephants instead of <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-scholz-says-sending-taurus-missiles-to-ukraine-is-out-of-the-question/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-scholz-says-sending-taurus-missiles-to-ukraine-is-out-of-the-question/">Taurus missiles</a>. And imagine the joy of taking a stroll through Munich’s Marienplatz and spotting a family of elephants! It would be like going on safari but with greater sausage options!</p>



<p>It would also make the expression “we need to talk about the elephant in the room” (which doesn&#8217;t really exist in German but that’s not going to stop me from making a labored joke) much more interesting because there would often be an actual elephant in the room.</p>



<p><em>And now a message from our Tenuous Links Department&#8230;</em></p>



<p>You know where there would be plenty of room for elephants? The moon! And soon the moon (and its large mammals) may have its own time zone. The U.S. government has <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20240403-us-directs-nasa-to-create-lunar-time-standard-for-space-bodies" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20240403-us-directs-nasa-to-create-lunar-time-standard-for-space-bodies" target="_blank">asked NASA</a> to establish a moon-centric time reference system, which is being dubbed Coordinated Lunar Time. That’s a little tricky as time does, of course, move more quickly on the moon because there are loads of exciting things to do there (or maybe because of gravity).</p>



<p><em>And now another message from our Tenuous Links Department&#8230;</em></p>



<p>But while you can’t have too many elephants or enough time, can you say the same about traditional Greek music?</p>



<p>Not according to the culture ministry in Athens, which wants more than 45 percent of all music played on local radio or in public spaces to be Greek.</p>



<p>This is clearly great news for local artists and those who want to hear “Zorba the Greek” every time they get into an elevator.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The French public’s allegiance to the idea of Europe remains strong, but a  a real understanding of the EU is weak — which is why Le Pen's de facto policy of dismantling it from the inside is poorly understood.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Mujtaba Rahman is the head of Eurasia Group’s Europe practice. He tweets at <a href="https://twitter.com/Mij_Europe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Mij_Europe</a></em>.</p>



<p>Whether in Brussels or any other European capital, these days it’s impossible to have any discussion about France without reference to the risk of opposition leader Marine Le Pen’s presidency in 2027.</p>



<p>Europeanizing France’s nuclear deterrent? “But would Le Pen stand by it?” France’s long-term commitment to Ukraine? “Would Le Pen support it?” Enlargement? “She would oppose it.” Just as former U.S. President Donald Trump has been able to set the parameters of America’s foreign policy from outside the White House, there’s a risk that Le Pen will now be able to do the same for France — and the EU — from outside the Elysée.</p>



<p>There are several reasons to believe Le Pen might become president on her fourth attempt, the first of which has little to do with her and everything to do with the cantankerous, fickle nature of the French electorate.</p>



<p>Voters in France like to kick out incumbents. In 2022, French President Emmanuel Macron became the first president of the Fifth Republic — the first in 64 years — to be reelected without first losing control to the opposition in a parliamentary election.</p>



<p>Macron can’t run for office again, but by 2027, his centrist alliance will have been in power for a decade. Additionally, both the left and the old center right show no signs of producing a credible candidate. So, if the French electorate wants something new — as they usually do — Le Pen will be their only real option.</p>



<p>Moreover, Le Pen has spent the last two years saying and doing as little as possible while trying to look presidential — and will likely spend the next three years doing the same. And her 88 deputies in the National Assembly, under orders to look serious and say nothing too radical, have given her party a veneer of respectability.</p>



<p>More than that, the further rise of her National Rally (RN) party has achieved an air of inevitability. Few younger voters are incensed by the connections her family and party have with the collaborationist Vichy regime of 1940 to 1944.</p>



<p>Then, there’s <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/french-far-right-marine-le-pen-cabal-after-new-report-on-russian-ties/">Le Pen’s financial and political links with Russian President Vladimir Putin</a>, which would be a problem if the election was held now. And while they may still be a problem in 2027, even now they haven’t prevented her party from building an almost 10-point <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-france-eu-election-cracks-the-whip-as-centrist-eu-campaign-stutters/">lead in the polls ahead of the European Parliament election in June</a>.</p>



<p>The French public’s allegiance to the idea of Europe remains theoretically strong, but a passion for or a real understanding of the EU is weak — which is why Le Pen’s de facto policy of dismantling the bloc from the inside is poorly understood.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/marine-le-pen-turned-respectable-france-presidential-election/">Le Pen’s “normalization</a>” has been based on the successful deception that she’s now a moderate who wants to shift economic power and advantage toward ordinary citizens. But while her economic program continues to be interventionist and left wing, her social, European and international policies remain as ultra-nationalist as ever. And while a French parliament hostile to Le Pen could block many of her proposals, it’s unlikely it would be able to block all of them.</p>



<p>If elected, a Le Pen presidency would at best lead to five years of drift and confusion at home and in the EU capital. At worst, it could remove a nuclear power, G7 member and permanent member of the U.N. Security Council from the Western alliance, starting a process that could break the EU apart — at least in its current form.</p>



<p>For example, while Le Pen may have <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/marine-le-pen-plays-down-her-ties-with-russia-before-second-round/">distanced herself from Putin</a> since he invaded Ukraine, but she still says that France should reduce its “dependency” on Berlin and Washington. And though she says she’d remain in NATO, she’d fundamentally undermine Ukraine’s ability to ever join the alliance — as well as block the country from becoming an EU member.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/GettyImages-1393428439-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4543848" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/GettyImages-1393428439.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/GettyImages-1393428439.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Voters in France like to kick out incumbents. Macron can’t run for office again, but by 2027, his centrist alliance will have been in power for a decade  | Aurelien Meunier/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>Under Macron, France hasn’t distinguished itself in its arms supplies to Kyiv — its economic aid has been more generous. But if the war continues for another three years, under Le Pen, both might end.</p>



<p>Moreover, almost all of Le Pen’s economic program, and much of her social and migration policy, depends on breaking EU laws — something she doesn’t openly recognize, instead counting on the fact that many in France don’t know how the EU works.</p>



<p>As I’ve stated before, by a constitutional amendment, Le Pen would seek to make it possible to discriminate against foreign residents — including EU residents — on jobs, welfare and housing. She’d give preference to French business in all national and local government contracts, and give extra subsidies to French farmers. She’d reimpose checks at France’s land borders with Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy and Spain. All of these policies would break EU laws on free movement and free trade, threatening to destroy the EU single market.</p>



<p>Le Pen also says she’d withhold part of France’s contribution to the EU budget. But under EU law, this is European money — not French money. And if implemented, these policies would bring legal action and financial retaliation from Brussels and domestic courts, which would cause a crisis of historic proportions in the EU.</p>



<p>At the center of Europe both politically and geographically, under Le Pen, France could find itself isolated — or the leader of a small group of dissident nations like Hungary. But an anti-EU Hungary or Slovakia is the equivalent of a sprained knee or elbow. An anti-EU France would be a disease in Europe’s heart and brain.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Catalan independence leader more recognizable at ground level than most big names from Brussels.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Brussels Bubble bigshots beware: You may be famous in Place Lux, but outside the European Quarter you&#8217;re a nobody.</p>



<p>That appears to be the lesson from a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/240312-InformeUE_Ingles.pdf">new survey</a> of 5,200 citizens of France, Germany, Denmark, Lithuania and Slovenia. While nearly three-quarters of respondents were able to correctly identify a photo of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, less than half recognized European Council President Charles Michel.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, almost 38 percent of respondents who participated in the survey were able to identify Catalan independence leader <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/carles-puigdemont-catalonia-independence-spain-election-pedro-sanchez-alberto-nunez-feijoo/">Carles Puigdemont</a> — making him more recognizable than European Parliament President Roberta Metsola.</p>



<p>Is that surprising? Perhaps not, considering the survey was commissioned by the Catalan separatist Junts party delegation in the European Parliament.</p>



<p>According to the survey, Puigdemont is also more familiar to ordinary Europeans than &nbsp;Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) leader Iratxe García or European People&#8217;s Party chief <a href="https://www.politico.eu/list/politico-28-class-of-2024/manfred-weber/">Manfred Weber</a>. The only place where Weber was better known than Puigdemont was in his home country of Germany, where 40 percent of respondents recognized his face.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Frustration with the EU</h2>



<p>Survey participants were also asked to rate the EU&#8217;s responses to several recent crises. Over half of respondents expressed satisfaction with Brussels&#8217; handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, with greater enthusiasm noted in northern countries such as Denmark and Lithuania.</p>



<p>When it came to the bloc&#8217;s approach to Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, meanwhile, there was a nearly even split, with 49.85 percent of respondents believing the EU had responded well and 49.81 percent having a negative view of its actions in the crisis. Respondents in France, Germany and Slovenia were the most disapproving of Brussels&#8217; strategies.</p>



<p>No such split existed in respondents&#8217; view of the EU&#8217;s handling of the war in Gaza, however, with more than half of participants saying Brussels&#8217; response had been &#8220;very or fairly bad.&#8221; The most critical evaluations came from Slovenia, where nearly three-quarters of respondents disapproved of the bloc&#8217;s actions.</p>



<p>The survey was similarly damning when it came to the migration crisis: 70 percent of respondents said the EU has done a bad job of addressing the issue.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Skepticism over independence</h2>



<p>The survey revealed that although many Europeans take a favorable view of self-determination movements like that led by Puigdemont in Catalonia, few believe they will actually succeed.</p>



<p>Around three-quarters of respondents in Lithuania and Slovenia expressed support for Catalan independence, which was also backed by 63.9 percent in Germany and 53.6 percent of Danish participants.</p>



<p>In a grouping that included the Basque country, Corsica, Flanders and Galicia, Catalonia was seen as the region most likely to achieve self-determination. Despite that view, a majority of respondents expressed skepticism that the independence movement would succeed. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[As party reels, new leader Gavin Robinson faces a U.K. election that could cost him his seat.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>BELFAST – The divided Democratic Unionists, in collective shock over the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/northern-ireland-dup-leader-jeffrey-donaldson-quits-arrest/">stunning fall</a> from grace of their ex-leader Jeffrey Donaldson, are trying to figure out how to keep it from leading to electoral disaster for Northern Ireland’s main pro-British party.</p>



<p>What seems certain, based on POLITICO’s discussions this week with several DUP lawmakers, is that Donaldson&#8217;s protege, Gavin Robinson, won’t be challenged as interim leader after he stepped into the role on an emergency basis last week. </p>



<p>That&#8217;s largely because nobody else wants the job this side of the U.K. general election, expected later this year.</p>



<p>Donaldson stood down as party leader on Good Friday after being charged with rape and other sexual offenses. He is due in court later this month.</p>



<p>His resignation dealt an unprecedented blow to a party that had just returned to power-sharing with the Irish nationalist side of the community following a two-year standoff with Britain over post-Brexit trade rules. It could reopen core divisions Donaldson had only just repaired within a feud-prone party that backed Brexit but hates the outcome — a Northern Ireland still subject to EU goods laws.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Another vacancy at the top?</h3>



<p>Hard-liners, privately critical of what they see as the willingness of new leader Robinson to compromise and end that Brexit standoff, told POLITICO there&#8217;s no need to challenge him now. They note his East Belfast seat in the House of Commons is the most vulnerable of all eight won by the DUP at the last election, meaning voters will soon have a chance to knock him out.</p>



<p>“Just watch what happens in East Belfast,” said one DUP lawmaker, who like others quoted in this story was granted anonymity to discuss internal party divisions frankly. “You can’t be leader if you lose your seat.”</p>



<p>Whenever Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calls the general election, the DUP faces a tough battle to retain all its Commons seats and counter the prevailing narrative of unionism in terminal decline versus the Irish republicans of Sinn Féin.</p>



<p>That challenge already looked difficult for the DUP following its January U-turn over re-entering a power-sharing government at Stormont — the Northern Ireland Assembly — alongside Sinn Féin. Initial opinion polls showed the DUP <a href="https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/dup-support-falls-after-partys-return-to-stormont-as-uup-and-tuv-gain-ground/a2080283141.html" target="_blank">losing votes</a> as a result.</p>



<p>In his tense <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/threats-wont-stop-me-reach-northern-ireland-deal-dup-chief-jeffrey-donaldson/">months of negotiations</a> with the U.K. government over the future of <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ireland-trade-booming-in-post-brexit-economy-dublin-belfast-uk/">cross-border trade</a> with the neighboring Republic of Ireland, Donaldson built a tight-knit DUP negotiating team of realists around him. That grouping appears vulnerable now that he’s gone.</p>



<p>Donaldson sold his <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65ba3b7bee7d490013984a59/Command_Paper__1_.pdf" target="_blank">Safeguarding the Union</a> deal with Sunak as “ending the Irish Sea border.” Many of his own MPs never supported it, however, agreeing instead with the DUP’s chief external critic, Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister, who <a href="https://twitter.com/JimAllister/status/1774854016821825822" target="_blank">branded</a> “the Donaldson Deal” a sellout.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="748" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/GettyImages-2063604716-1024x748.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4544277" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/GettyImages-2063604716.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/GettyImages-2063604716.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The DUP faces a tough battle to retain all its Commons seats and counter the prevailing narrative of unionism in terminal decline versus the Irish republicans of Sinn Féin | Charles McQuillan/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>Robinson may find it difficult to lead a coherent DUP election campaign if, as some fear, his own fellow MPs snipe at the compromise deal he helped to strike by Donaldson&#8217;s side.</p>



<p>“The &#8216;Donaldson Deal&#8217; could very easily be rebranded the &#8216;Robinson Deal,&#8217; because he was right beside Jeffrey the entire way in negotiating that deal. It’s going to become a point of attack as we face a general election,” said a second DUP lawmaker, who supports the U-turn and return to government at Stormont, and doesn’t want a hard-liner to succeed Robinson. </p>



<p>“We need to defend against these attacks with unity. It will be a problem if, as a party, we cannot fully back the deal on the doorsteps and instead put our divisions on display.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Vulnerable</h3>



<p>Also vulnerable to an internal DUP putsch is Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly, who in 2022 was <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/dup-leader-jeffrey-donaldson-quits-northern-ireland-assembly-to-stay-mp/">picked</a> by Donaldson to fill his own Northern Ireland Assembly seat so he could remain an MP at Westminster. Even her supporters concede that her personal democratic deficit — she was a longtime DUP special adviser twice appointed to Stormont, never elected — means she cannot afford missteps in office.</p>



<p>So far, Little-Pengelly has starred in her new <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/meet-the-daughters-of-rival-militants-who-now-run-northern-ireland-together/">bridge-building role</a> alongside First Minister <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/michelle-oneill-sinn-fein-northern-ireland-protestant-stormont/">Michelle O’Neill</a> of Sinn Féin — but the hardline faction grumbles, just as it did with the DUP’s first power-sharing leader, the late Ian Paisley, that she appears to be getting on a little too well with the enemy.</p>



<p>“I don’t want to see her swinging any more hurleys,” said a third DUP lawmaker, referring to Little-Pengelly’s recent <a href="https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/northern-irelands-deputy-minister-emma-little-pengelly-visits-gaa-club-for-the-first-time-and-plays-hurling/a70234169.html" target="_blank">joint appearance</a> with O’Neill at a Gaelic sports club in Sinn Féin’s power base of Catholic west Belfast. A hurley is the bat used in the native Irish sports of hurling and camogie — games that some particularly snarly unionists still excoriate as “the IRA at play.”</p>

<p>Robinson, 39, a former barrister who became deputy leader last year as Donaldson sought to position loyal lieutenants around him, held his <a href="https://twitter.com/newsoncool/status/1775864795113181658" target="_blank">first press conference</a> as interim leader Thursday — and still looked and sounded stunned by his sudden elevation.</p>



<p>“The last six days have been incredibly difficult and shocking, not just for us within the Democratic Unionist Party but for the community right throughout Northern Ireland,” <a href="https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/recent-days-have-been-difficult-and-shocking-for-ni-says-dups-gavin-robinson/a484561276.html" target="_blank">he said</a>. In private meetings with lawmakers and grassroots members this week, he said, they shared “a determination and recognition that what has gone before us is not reflective of us. It is not attributed to us.”</p>



<p>A fourth DUP lawmaker interviewed by POLITICO, who supported Donaldson but wants to see Robinson put clear blue water between himself and his predecessor, described the mood inside party ranks as “so unbelievable, so weird, so surreal  — I’ve never experienced anything like it.”</p>



<p>This politician described a sense of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-68692428" target="_blank">whiplash</a> over how Donaldson had won praises in Washington during St. Patrick&#8217;s Day celebrations only to become a political pariah by Easter. “Sir Jeffrey was supposed to be the one to steady the ship,” he said. “I’m just bracing for the next shock now.”</p>



<p>Donaldson is currently suspended from the party and all traces of him have been removed from the DUP website. He is charged with rape, gross indecency and indecent assault, with his wife Eleanor facing charges of aiding and abetting his alleged offenses. Donaldson denies the charges; his wife has not commented.</p>



<p>The DUP isn’t pushing Donaldson to resign as MP for Lagan Valley, one of the party’s safest seats southwest of Belfast. A by-election could give a powerful early campaign platform for Alliance, the middle-ground party that also is Robinson&#8217;s main challenger in East Belfast whenever the general election comes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Nightmare scenario</h3>



<p>Elections analyst David McCann projected that if the DUP loses even small fractions of its base — to pro-EU moderates on the left, and to the Sinn Féin-bashing Traditional Unionist Voice on the right — it would cost the DUP two of its eight Commons seats. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long would win East Belfast, he argued, while the Ulster Unionists’ Robin Swann would take South Antrim. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="699" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/GettyImages-1740236880-1024x699.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4544307" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/GettyImages-1740236880.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/GettyImages-1740236880.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Donaldson&#8217;s protege, Gavin Robinson | Charles McQuillan/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>In this scenario, Sinn Féin would hold its seven seats and potentially gain one, overtaking the DUP at Westminster, where the Irish republicans refuse even to take their seats in protest against the very existence of Northern Ireland as part of the U.K.</p>



<p>McCann envisions a morning news bulletin that would end Robinson&#8217;s tenuous hold on the leadership and plunge his party — and perhaps Northern Ireland — into renewed political turmoil. </p>



<p>“DUP leader defeated and they’ve lost top spot as Sinn Féin completes the hat trick,” McCann said, referring to Sinn Féin’s poll-topping performances in the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/sinn-fein-northern-ireland-assembly-election-dup-jeffrey-donaldson-michelle-o-neill-power-sharing-brexit/">2022 Stormont election</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/sinn-fein-wins-record-vote-tally-northern-ireland-voters-rage-dup-blockade-stormont-election/">2023 council elections</a>.</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s the nightmare scenario that’s potentially facing the DUP the day after the election.” </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>POLITICO’s reporters are speaking to voters to find out what will convince them to head to the ballot box (or not) in the European election in June.</em></p>



<p>FRENCH RIVIERA — On the famed Croisette promenade in Cannes, retired French boomers have temporarily reclaimed the stretch of shore that is taken over by celebrities and tourists during the summer months. Here, Europe is something nearly no one wants to talk about.</p>



<p>“It’s simple: I only care about women, fishing and <em>les boules</em>,” said one elderly man, referring to <em>pétanque</em> (a game similar to bocce ball), as he watched the sunset with two ladies and their little dogs, who were all wearing fancier clothes than POLITICO’s reporter — dogs included.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While he was not even aware of the upcoming European election —&nbsp;in which nearly 450 million voters across 27 countries are eligible to cast ballots — the elderly Frenchman, who asked not to be identified, said if he were going to vote, he would back the far-right National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen.</p>



<p>This sprawling southeast corner of France, the <em>Côte d&#8217;Azur</em> or French Riviera has for decades been a stronghold of the political right, thanks in part to an aging demographic and built on nationalist ideology stemming from the 1960s return of French settlers from Algeria.</p>



<p>Home to some 1 million people, <a href="https://www.francetravail.org/files/live/sites/peorg-paca/files/documents/Statistiques%20&amp;%20analyses/Entreprises/Environnement-socio-economique/Portrait%20socio-eco/NOV-2018/DT06/E&amp;S-Portrait-socio-economique-des-Alpes-Maritimes.pdf" target="_blank">who mostly work in public administration or the tourism industry</a>, the region has in recent years become even more receptive to right-wing ideas, with representatives of the far right having success in local elections.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/GettyImages-1232981039-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4543137" style="aspect-ratio:1.499267935578331;width:792px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/GettyImages-1232981039.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/GettyImages-1232981039.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Le Pen seeks to win over more middle-class and bourgeois voters | Valery Hache/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>The French Riviera could be proof that the “normalization” of right-wing ideology is becoming more accepted and mainstream, said author Charles Sapin, who has written a book on nationalists&#8217; rise across the Continent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Le Pen has spent the past several years seeking to expand her <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2023/09/03/marine-le-pen-nantie-du-vote-populaire-vise-les-classes-moyennes_6187612_823448.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2023/09/03/marine-le-pen-nantie-du-vote-populaire-vise-les-classes-moyennes_6187612_823448.html" target="_blank">hardcore base</a> by winning over more middle-class<a href="https://www.liberation.fr/checknews/presidentielle-2022-est-il-vrai-que-les-classes-populaires-ont-plus-vote-melenchon-que-le-pen-20231005_3MQJFRABGJBHHAAXNMAF53NR7Q/?redirected=1" target="_blank"> and bourgeois voters</a>. That, she hopes, will be the last piece of the puzzle that gets her into power.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;We don&#8217;t talk about politics with our friends&#8217;</h2>



<p>As he was walking his dog after his day at work at a swanky hotel in Cannes, Éric Labeaune, a 50-something man with a shiny puffer jacket, said many of his friends<strong> </strong>had shifted their outlook and become openly racist. Some of them say they won’t go on holiday in countries like Morocco or Tunisia because there are “too many Arabs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don’t talk about politics with our friends now, otherwise we get angry,” said his wife Yasmina Labaune, who works in the same hotel. </p>



<p>The Labaunes were reluctant to talk about their own political beliefs but Éric did say that Jordan Bardella — Le Pen’s 28-year-old protégé and head of the National Rally list for the EU election — often said things on TV that “everybody agreed on.”</p>



<p>As he made that statement on the Croisette, where tourists pose next to luxury cars parked in front of Louis Vuitton and other high-end shops, Éric Labeaune raised his eyebrows in a knowing look, as if it is universally understood that what Bardella is saying are simply facts about France’s decline.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/IMG_2515-1-768x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4544184" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=768,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/IMG_2515-1.png 768w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=225,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/IMG_2515-1.png 225w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Croisette avenue in Cannes. | Elisa Braun/POLITICO</figcaption></figure>



<p>Further down the Croisette, an old chess player with a French flag pin on his jacket did not want to give his name but was more than happy to speak for 15 minutes about vaccines, Joe Biden, and journalists who are not ready to hear the truth or do their job properly. He said that even Le Pen was too centrist for him — he much preferred her former ally and “true patriot” Florian Philippot, who launched an anti-EU movement called The Patriots after ditching the National Rally.</p>



<p>“I’m just too emotional to talk about politics,” said an old lady from Mandelieu-la-Napoule, just along the coast from Cannes. Wearing Gucci loafers and thick sunglasses, she smiled politely as she declined to comment further. Other older people POLITICO tried to talk to refused to speak about the European election either because they did not care about it or feared they could be scammed out of their savings if they spoke to a journalist. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Le Pen is no longer frightening</h2>



<p>As in many other parts of Europe, support for the far right is growing across France, due to the usual mix of disillusionment with national leaders, the rising cost of living, and identity fears.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“All around Europe, similar dynamics have already helped nationalist leaders take over power, especially now that they have softened their tone on issues that frightened those economically liberal voters who didn’t like anti-Europe stances,” Sapin, the writer, said.</p>



<p>And while French President Emmanuel Macron defeated Le Pen in 2022, she won more than 40 percent of the vote, signaling a deeply divided country.</p>



<p>“The [National Rally] no longer frightens voters here because it has become more respectable at local level, in the national assembly and, above all, Macron is very strongly rejected,” said the conservative mayor of Antibes Jean Leonetti, who moved to this tourist town popular with billionaires decades ago to work as a cardiologist.</p>



<p>In this privileged area, where local mayors like Leonetti have been <a href="https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/provence-alpes-cote-d-azur/alpes-maritimes/logement-sociaux-cannet-condamnee-payer-amende-plus-million-euros-1145139.html" target="_blank">fined for refusing to create social housing</a>, a growing sense of insecurity is taking over the local population, according to Thierry Cornec, a far-right activist who ran against Leonetti in the Antibes mayoral election.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="769" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/IMG_7786-1024x769.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4543710" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/IMG_7786.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/04/IMG_7786.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tanguy Cornec, in his pharmacy from Juan Les Pins. | Elisa Braun/POLITICO</figcaption></figure>



<p>“France is facing a number of serious threats like migration, insecurity, loss of values, and an identity crisis at the individual and national level,” Cornec said from inside his pharmacy in the seaside town of Juan-les-Pins, adding that he felt it was his duty to “fight back again a prevailing psychosis” that was taking over people.</p>



<p>If the people here are indeed changing, then so is the landscape: the coastal promenades of Nice and Cannes are home to anti-terror installations that are a constant reminder of what happened there.</p>



<p>In the past decade alone, the south of France has seen a cargo truck rammed into heaving crowds on the Nice promenade, and stabbings in a church. The fear of more terror attacks is real for many in this area.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also anti-immigrant sentiment (and the two fears are conflated for many), which has revived fears in the region that the relaxed seafront lifestyle could be threatened by more than mere tax hikes.</p>



<p>Even Ukrainian refugees are not always welcome.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some families have moved here with large SUVs, which are the subject of suspicious comments from local residents. </p>



<p>&#8220;Macron is talking about sending troops to Ukraine and they&#8217;re here with their big cars,&#8221; said one restaurant owner from Antibes, who asked POLITICO not to identify him or his establishment, fearing backlash in response to his anti-immigrant sentiments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, the owner conceded, one group that is always welcome is wealthy tourists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Whether they are Russians, Arabs, Africans, ordinary tourists or dictators, a client is a client,” the restaurant owner said. Asked about who he would vote for in June, the owner responded with a single name: Marine Le Pen.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Multinationals warn new migration rules and fiscal reforms could drive them to take their business elsewhere.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Netherlands was long a well-known home base for multinationals. Now, firms are eyeing the exit. </p>



<p>Microchips darling ASML — at €360 billion the most highly valued technology firm in Europe — has rung the loudest alarm bell yet, delivering a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europes-tech-champions-sound-the-alarm-over-migration-rhetoric/">threat</a> early March to politicians in The Hague that it might look across the border to find the space, engineering talent and political support it needs to expand.</p>



<p>The government of outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte got the message and last month announced a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2024/03/28/nederland-investeert-25-miljard-euro-in-sterk-ondernemingsklimaat-voor-microchipsector-brainport-eindhoven" target="_blank">€2.5 billion support scheme</a>&nbsp;for the tech-heavy region where ASML and its spin-offs are based.</p>



<p>But it could be too little, too late. </p>



<p>“We’ll probably get a right-wing government, but not one that is pro-business,” Rem Korteweg, a senior researcher at Dutch think tank Clingendael, told POLITICO. </p>



<p>A wave of partial relocations, and threats thereof, have hit the country right in the middle of a political storm.</p>



<p>The Hague is bracing for a shift to the right after Geert Wilders’ far-right Party of Freedom (PVV) won last November’s <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/far-right-leader-geert-wilders-wins-dutch-election-exit-poll/">general election</a>. </p>



<p>“The Netherlands is perhaps the most open economy in Europe or even the world — but we’re running into the limits of growth,” said Korteweg.</p>



<p>A Wilders-shaped government — if and when he finally forms one — would spell profound change on issues like taxation and immigration, where companies crave predictability to plan, invest, hire and grow for the long term. Other countries like France and Germany are taking better care of these “side conditions,” ASML CEO Peter Wennink <a href="https://x.com/Nieuwsuur/status/1765668570531283232?s=20" target="_blank">warned</a> in early March. </p>



<p>If ASML does pull the trigger, that could draw a line under four centuries of open trade and commerce that have brought unprecedented prosperity. </p>



<p>The Netherlands opened for business before any other European country —&nbsp;the Dutch East India Company was the world’s first joint-stock company and, as an imperial and commercial enterprise with a monopoly on trade with Asia through much of the 17th and 18th century, it is considered by some to have been the first multinational.</p>



<p>That was the start of centuries of companies settling in the open economy, as the country developed its strategic location as Europe&#8217;s port of entry. It even spawned the term “<em>de B.V. Nederland</em>,” translatable as “Netherlands, Inc.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pressure tactics</h3>



<p>Big Corp. didn’t always put down deep roots.</p>



<p>Unilever, known for consumer brands Dove, Hellmann’s and Knorr, was created in the 1930s by a merger of a Dutch margarine company and a British soap maker. Oil company Shell is a similar creature, formed out of a 1907 tie-up by Dutch and U.K. rivals.</p>



<p>These dual Anglo-Dutch structures long benefited the Netherlands: the companies had their headquarters, stock listings and tax registries in the country. </p>



<p>But they also put pressure on politicians to keep the businesses onside —&nbsp;after all, their bosses could decide to shake up their corporate structure and locate their HQ abroad.</p>



<p>Unilever <a href="https://www.unilever.com/news/press-and-media/press-releases/2020/completion-of-unilevers-unification/" target="_blank">shifted</a> its operations in November 2020 to a single, U.K.-registered parent company. Shell, too, moved its headquarters from the Netherlands to the U.K. in 2021. The flight followed years of talks of how to placate these companies. But they left anyway.</p>



<p>ASML’s complaints diverge from those of Unilever or Shell, since they aren’t about where the companies are registered on paper. The threat entails something more economically significant: actual investment plans.</p>



<p>The global chips industry is poised to almost double in size by 2030 <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/exploring-new-regions-the-greenfield-opportunity-in-semiconductors" target="_blank">with revenues passing the $1 trillion mark</a>, consultancy McKinsey forecasts. As a unique supplier to this industry, there’s no doubt that ASML will grow too.</p>



<p>The question is: where? </p>



<p>So far, the tech hub around the country’s fifth-largest city Eindhoven has been ASML’s base. Marketeers even invented the moniker “brainport” for it, to rival the Rotterdam port classification of “Mainport.” ASML has stayed close to its roots at household name Philips, in Eindhoven near a top-tier technical university.<strong> </strong></p>



<p>But ASML CEO Wennink <a href="https://x.com/Nieuwsuur/status/1765668570531283232?s=20" target="_blank">questioned</a> if Eindhoven was still the right spot, after meetings in The Hague in early March. He lambasted a “significant gap” between the reality of what companies need to grow, and the perception of what politicians think companies need.</p>



<p>One issue that triggered ASML’s fury was an amendment last October by key lawmaker Pieter Omtzigt to curb a 30 percent expatriate tax break. Omtzigt is a kingmaker in the ongoing negotiations over a new Dutch national government: his startup political party, New Social Contract, could make or break the next coalition. That cripples ASML’s chances for the tax break to be restored.</p>



<p>Beyond the impact on ASML’s workforce in the Netherlands (around 40 percent is not Dutch), Wennink says it’s equally annoying how measures like these are rushed through—“in 24 hours” and “insufficiently thought through.”&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">‘Thoughtless policy making’ </h3>



<p>Creating an attractive climate for companies should be boring and predictable. The current political climate in the Netherlands has been anything but —&nbsp;and Dutch employers federation VNO-NCW has been a vocal critic.</p>



<p>“A lot of publicly-traded companies are considering a possible departure of their headquarters abroad. You need at least two hands to count them all,” the federation&#8217;s chairwoman Ingrid Thijssen <a href="https://www.telegraaf.nl/financieel/1107628050/meer-dan-tien-grote-beursgenoteerde-bedrijven-denken-aan-vertrek-uit-nederland" target="_blank">told local newspaper De Telegraaf</a>.</p>



<p>The federation’s spokesperson Edwin van Scherrenburg singled out curbing expat advantages and limiting share buyback options as a “sign of unpredictable and thoughtless policy making,” in a statement shared with POLITICO.</p>



<p>Others have slammed the capriciousness of The Hague. </p>



<p>A stable government is a key requirement to grow companies, said Robert-Jan Smits, president of the executive board of the TU/Eindhoven and member of the Brainport Foundation supporting Eindhoven&#8217;s development.</p>



<p>Companies “don’t want to be confronted with continuous uncertainty, as is currently happening in the Netherlands, with all kinds of ad hoc measures, with regards to fiscal [policy],” Smits said in an interview.</p>



<p>Laurens Dassen, a Dutch lawmaker for pro-Europe party Volt, said policymakers were also short-sighted in funneling money from a €20 billion “National Growth Fund” earmarked for projects to drive long-term growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re sacrificing your long-term investments, your future earning capacity, for short-term fun for the taxpayer,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Changing the guard</h3>



<p>Adding to the concerns is the fact that Prime Minister Mark Rutte is on his way out. Rutte — himself a manager at Unilever until the early 2000s — has been credited with being open to some of the concerns voiced by big companies, like abolishing the dividend tax.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rutte’s last government fell, triggering an election in which migration was a key issue and Wilders’ anti-immigrant party PVV emerged victorious. In its election program, the PVV vowed to “to restrict study migration” with a limit on international students on masters programs.</p>



<p>For multinationals, that has raised fears over how to attract global talent and house an often foreign workforce. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While the coalition talks have yet to achieve a breakthrough, companies like ASML are on high alert.</p>



<p>“Sixty-five percent of all the international students at the technical university in Eindhoven settle in this region,” ASML CEO Wennink said in January, adding that they are a source of talent that the company needs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Weapon deliveries need “to be done properly,” a Pentagon spokesperson said.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Pentagon is defending its steady rollout of weapons to Ukraine even as officials in Kyiv say the assistance is coming too slowly — and it might already be too late to help turn the tide of the war in Ukraine’s favor.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, POLITICO <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-great-risk-front-line-collapse-war-russia/" target="_blank">detailed criticisms</a> from high-ranking Ukrainian officials, who said they can’t defend the frontlines any longer: “There’s nothing that can help Ukraine now,” one of the officials said.</p>



<p>The West doesn’t have the technology to help Ukraine, and it also hasn’t sent weapons quickly enough, the officials said. While the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/17/f-16-us-ukraine-denmark-netherlands-00111769" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incoming F-16 fighter jets</a>&nbsp;are welcome, they would’ve been more helpful a year ago, a senior officer said. The planes were originally&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/21/u-s-f-16-ukraine-00107620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to arrive</a>&nbsp;in Ukraine by the end of 2023, and now they’re supposed to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/world/europe/ukraine-f16-pilots.html#:~:text=So%20far%2C%20Denmark%2C%20the%20Netherlands,the%20year%20and%20into%202025." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrive by late spring</a>&nbsp;once pilot training is complete.</p>



<p>The Defense Department also wants the process to be quicker, but is arguing that it’s inching along for good reason.</p>



<p>“While getting F-16s to Ukraine sooner would be ideal, it still needs to be done properly and we believe they will still provide a significant boost to Ukraine’s air power when they become operational,” said Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Charlie Dietz.</p>



<p>National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said more than a year ago that the jets alone&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/21/u-s-f-16-ukraine-00107620#:~:text=The%20Biden%20administration%20expects%20American,warplanes%20as%20quickly%20as%20possible." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wouldn’t be enough</a>&nbsp;to change the course of the war in Kyiv’s favor, and the Ukrainian officials told POLITICO the delay has rendered them irrelevant on the battlefield due to the shifting nature of the war.</p>



<p>Russia’s large number of soldiers also “poses a formidable threat,” Dietz continued, but he argued that advanced Western weapon systems combined with Ukraine’s skilled forces and spirit are helping to level the playing field. Dietz noted that the U.S. has provided some $74.6 billion in assistance since the invasion began.</p>



<p>But Ukraine seems to be making increasingly desperate moves, a sign that things aren’t going so well. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-conscription-mobilization-251058a942a253f3eaec2c53373adf03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lowered the minimum draft age</a>&nbsp;from 27 to 25 years old this week as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-faces-an-acute-manpower-shortage-with-young-men-dodging-the-draft/#:~:text=An%20early%20burst%20of%20patriotic,war%20in%20its%20third%20year.&amp;text=KYIV%20%E2%80%94%20The%2028%2Dyear%2D,registering%20their%20details%20as%20required." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">men dodge conscription</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/zelenskyy-fires-senior-aide-sacks-fires-shefir-ukraine-war-reshuffle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired a senior aide and several advisers</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/zelenskyy-fires-ukraines-top-general-zaluzhny/#:~:text=The%20two%20had%20strong%20differences%20over%20how%20the%20war%20should%20be%20fought.&amp;text=KYIV%20%E2%80%94%20Ukrainian%20President%20Volodymyr%20Zelenskyy,of%20tensions%20between%20the%20two." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet another</a>&nbsp;government reshuffle.</p>



<p>Kyiv’s delays in obtaining F-16s and Army Tactical Missile Systems from Washington are just two examples of “how much of a fight it’s been to drag the White House along to where our allies have been for months,” said Doug Klain, an Atlantic Council analyst focuses on Russia’s war in Ukraine. “We’ve already seen that their fears about escalation or Ukrainian proficiency are overblown.”</p>



<p>The Pentagon is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/12/white-house-aid-package-ukraine-00146487" target="_blank">planning to send</a> a number of older ATACMS to the country, which can travel 100 miles and carry warheads containing hundreds of cluster bomblets, and it already <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/17/biden-decision-send-longer-range-missiles-to-ukraine-00121969" target="_blank">secretly sent some</a> in September.</p>



<p>But Ukrainian officials say there’s one thing that could make a difference now: They want more Patriot missile defense systems to protect against the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-ukraine-attack-missiles-drones-kyiv-lviv-poland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent barrages</a>&nbsp;of Russian airstrikes, and they want them yesterday.</p>



<p>“Ukraine is the only country in the world that defends itself from ballistic missile strikes almost daily. Therefore, Patriot systems nowadays should operate in Ukraine and not be stored in hangars,” according to an internal Ukrainian government document sent Thursday setting out talking points for Ukrainian officials, obtained by POLITICO. “The transfer of Patriot systems to Ukraine is a matter of political will, not physical ability.”</p>



<p>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-allies-not-giving-enough-air-defence-minister-says-2024-04-03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said Wednesday that partners</a>&nbsp;haven’t been sending enough Patriot missile defense systems to Kyiv, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-ukrainian-foreign-minister-dmytro-kuleba-before-their-meeting-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made the plea</a>&nbsp;for more air defenses before a meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday.</p>



<p>The country has a few Patriot systems contributed by the U.S., Germany and The Netherlands — all of which Zelenskyy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2023/12/12/zelenskyy-says-he-only-has-air-defenses-to-protect-kyiv-00131333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said were positioned</a>&nbsp;only around Kyiv. Kuleba said partners have more than 100 Patriots at their disposal, and other top officials say that Ukraine can’t obtain more systems by itself.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Zelenskyy's powerful chief of staff tells POLITICO Republicans must step up as Russia is likely to make a big push on Kharkiv in May or June.  ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>KYIV — U.S. Republicans and their candidate for the White House, Donald Trump, must remember they’re the party of Ronald Reagan and support Ukraine as Russian forces build up for a major offensive from May or June. </p>



<p>That was the message from Andriy Yermak, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s powerful chief of staff, in an interview with POLITICO in Kyiv on Thursday evening.</p>



<p>Asked whether he feared Trump being reelected, or that President Joe Biden’s $60 billion aid package for Ukraine won&#8217;t eventually be passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where it has been stalled for months by Trump loyalists, Yermak said he couldn&#8217;t believe Republicans would forget Reagan&#8217;s 1981-1989 presidency and his Cold War crusade against Moscow&#8217;s ‘evil empire.’</p>



<p>“I don&#8217;t believe anybody who represents the party of Ronald Reagan will abandon Ukraine. Reagan understood the Soviet Union and Russia, and anyone who does will continue to support our fighters because they understand that dictators never stop voluntarily and have to be stopped,” he said.</p>



<p>Yermak, who minutes earlier had just got off the phone with Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, remained positive the aid will eventually be approved.</p>



<p>He wasn&#8217;t sure when that would happen, but insisted it had to be soon. “In the meantime it is costing us lives and I very much hope that it is passed this month because Ukraine is approaching a critical moment,” he said.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/04/biden-mike-johnson-ukraine-aid-00150488" target="_blank">Biden aides have been working behind the scenes to ensure House Speaker&nbsp;Mike Johnson&nbsp;</a>does put the multi-billion-dollar aid package for Ukraine up for a vote as early as next week. Biden has publicly pressured House Republicans to pass the package but avoided attacking the speaker, opting to give him the space to persuade his fractious GOP caucus.</p>



<p>Zelenskyy and his top officials have also been quietly lobbying the Republicans. The <a href="https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/03/28/7448617/" target="_blank">Ukrainian president revealed last week he had a phone conversation with Johnson</a>, in which he outlined how crucial the aid package is for Ukraine and detailed the surge in missile and drone strikes and the devastation they are causing, especially to the country’s energy infrastructure.</p>



<p>The pummeling Ukraine has come under in the past three weeks is part of a campaign to soften it up for a major Russian offensive, Yermak said.</p>



<p>He saw the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest, as the most likely target for the main thrust of an assault. <a href="https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/03/31/7448992/" target="_blank">Kharkiv has come in for an especially ferocious battering</a> and and large-scale Russian attacks have wrecked its power plants.</p>



<p>“We know that Putin is preparing a new wave of mobilization and we reckon new counter-offensive operations&nbsp; by the Russians could start at the end of the May or the beginning of June. Of course, we have to be ready for this,” Yermak said. “We still critically need additional air-defense systems because without them it is impossible to for us to defend our cities,” he added.</p>



<p>Yermak said more Patriot surface-to-air missiles are also needed to defend the front lines, where <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-ukraine-war-trench-attack/">the Russians are causing massive damage, and some fear tilting the military balance, with aerial guided bombs</a>. </p>



<p>The 1.5-ton bombs are a conversion of an old Soviet-era weapon and are delivered by fighter jets some 70 kilometers from the target then directed by a guidance system, using pop-out wings to glide toward its target. They were were used in the recent Russian offensive in the Donetsk region and played havoc with defenses at Avdiivka, a town in eastern Ukraine that fell to Russia last month.</p>



<p>“But once again, the problem for us is of the time,” says Yermak. “I&#8217;d like to emphasize that it&#8217;s a critical moment now. It&#8217;s very important the package is approved this month,” he added.</p>



<p>Asked about whether Ukraine will heed American pleas to avoid striking Russian oil facilities, Yermak avoided commenting directly. Zelenskyy last week said in an interview with the Washington Post that targeting Russian energy infrastructure is a legitimate military strategy.</p>



<p>Yermak expanded on that, saying that there has “to be payback for what the Russians are doing to us. We must ruin their critical infrastructure — as the only language they understand is force.”</p>
