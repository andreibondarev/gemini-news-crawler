					<description><![CDATA[The former president’s demeanor Monday was markedly different than last week, when Stormy Daniels testified.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>NEW YORK — Face to face in court on Monday with his fixer-turned-nemesis Michael Cohen — the witness whose testimony is key to New York prosecutors’ criminal case against him — Donald Trump seemed determined to project that he was unworried, if not unbothered.</p>



<p>After all, he was up in the polls.</p>



<p>“The New York Times&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/13/trump-narrow-lead-battleground-00157541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just came out with a poll</a>&nbsp;that shows us leading everywhere by a lot,” Trump said, waving a stack of papers in the air, his first public words Monday as he held his morning gaggle in the courthouse hallway.</p>



<p>He wasn’t just merely up in five out of six key battleground states, as the newspaper’s latest survey found, but “in Nevada we’re leading, actually, by 12 points, which is generally a Democratic state,” Trump said. “I think we’re leading in New Jersey — we had a rally of over 100,000 people this weekend.”</p>



<p>Trump wasn’t ahead in New Jersey, a heavily Democratic state he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost to now-President Joe Biden</a>&nbsp;by more than 15 percentage points in 2020. And his weekend rally on a boardwalk along the Jersey shore — while drawing a sea of thousands upon thousands of red MAGA caps — likely did not generate six-figure attendance numbers. But despite Cohen offering potentially damning testimony against him in court — the place he has been confined for much of the last month — Trump’s overall political prospects on Monday hardly appeared grim.</p>



<p>And the former president’s demeanor during the day’s court proceeding was markedly different than last week, when porn star Stormy Daniels testified. Trump on the first day of her testimony&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/09/trump-stormy-daniels-trial-testimony-00157192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grew so visibly angry that the judge intervened</a>.</p>



<p>On Monday, after initially — briefly — shifting in his chair and rolling his eyes as Cohen took the stand, the former president promptly restrained himself. For hours, Trump took in the testimony with his eyes shut, nearly reactionless, moving only occasionally to scratch an itch, whisper or pass a note to his attorney, read a document or glance at the computer monitor in front of him before going back to his shut-eye pose.</p>



<p>Across the room, Cohen, the state’s top witness, was seeking to make the case against the former president, calmly delivering his testimony as the district attorney’s office, but not yet Trump’s lawyers, questioned him extensively about his years-long role as a personal attorney and fixer for Trump. Cohen spoke of “tasks” that he said he carried out at Trump’s request to protect Trump’s financial, personal and political interests, recalling details like Trump’s comment that a Playboy model he reportedly had an affair with was “really beautiful,” and a porn star he had sex with was a “beautiful woman.”</p>



<p>Such a trial against a former president is historic and unprecedented, and it has disrupted Trump’s ability to campaign, constraining him to a courtroom for days on end over the past month. But it’s also a criminal case that Americans already see as&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-indictment-hush-money-poll-b3d9a555993faf22e6ebfaf798bfbd2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weaker than Trump’s other legal woes</a>. And despite headline news about the trial continuing for nearly a month now — and economic conditions improving for Biden — Trump’s lead in battleground polls hasn’t budged.</p>



<p>Monday’s testimony came on the heels of his massive weekend campaign rally, in which he drew thousands of supporters to Wildwood, New Jersey, a conservative area in the Democratic state. It’s the latest in a series of blue-state visits Trump is making as he argues, with limited to no polling evidence, that his lead against Biden is so strong that states like New York, Virginia and Minnesota are also in play for him this year.</p>



<p>Trump is scheduled to speak at a GOP fundraising dinner in Minnesota on Friday — a day the judge has agreed to cancel court so he can attend his son’s high school graduation in Florida — before traveling to Dallas on Saturday to speak at a National Rifle Association convention.</p>



<p>But before Trump returns to the campaign trail this weekend, he’ll have to withstand additional critical testimony from Cohen — perhaps spanning as long as two more days. And despite the subdued demeanor of both Trump and Cohen on Monday, tensions could still flare between the two former allies. Both men had taken to publicly eviscerating the other ahead of trial, until the judge instructed each to stop.</p>



<p>The Trump defense team’s cross-examination of Cohen will likely be designed to elicit a much different response than the measured, reasonable-sounding testimony the prosecution wants jurors to hear from Cohen.</p>



<p>Cohen, a convicted felon who served time in federal prison related to Trump hush money payments and other crimes, has admitted to lying under oath on multiple occasions, including to Congress. Key to Trump’s defense is his lawyers’ ability to convince the jury that Cohen is not a credible witness.</p>

<p>Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/13/donald-trump-trial-jd-vance-tuberville-00157657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is bringing an entourage of allies</a>&nbsp;with him to court each day, a group on Monday that included GOP Sens.&nbsp;J.D. Vance&nbsp;of Ohio and&nbsp;Tommy Tuberville&nbsp;of Alabama, among other elected officials. On Tuesday, his former Republican primary rival Vivek Ramaswamy is scheduled to attend court with Trump, a spokesperson for the biotech entrepreneur confirmed.</p>



<p>As Sen.&nbsp;Rick Scott&nbsp;(R-Fla.) did last week, Trump’s team of surrogates on Monday held their own press conference midday outside the building, decrying the conditions of the courthouse and the merits of the trial in video clips campaign officials would share online throughout the afternoon.</p>



<p>After restraining himself in court all day, Trump blew off some steam after walking into the hallway to address reporters Monday afternoon — “storming out of the courtroom,” as he has routinely put it in recent fundraising appeals.</p>



<p>“They’ve kept me here for three and a half, four weeks, instead of campaigning,” Trump said, again waving a stack of papers that contained positive commentary and news stories his staff had compiled for him. “Yet, we still have the best poll numbers.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s the bluntest articulation yet from a Biden administration official that Israel can’t succeed at its goal of wiping out Hamas.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Biden administration doesn’t believe Israel’s current strategy against the Hamas militant group will lead to “total victory,” a top U.S. official said Monday.</p>



<p>Speaking at the NATO Youth Summit in Miami, Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said the U.S. has been “struggling over what the theory of victory is” in Gaza.</p>



<p>“Sometimes when we listen closely to Israeli leaders, they talked about mostly the idea of some sort of sweeping victory on the battlefield, total victory,” Campbell said. “I don’t think we believe that that is likely or possible.”</p>



<p>It’s the most blunt articulation yet from a Biden administration official that Israel may not be able to achieve the full victory over Hamas that it has promised in Gaza. U.S. officials have previously warned that&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/05/06/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-and-national-security-communications-advisor-john-kirby-3/" target="_blank">Israel can’t defeat Hamas’ ideology</a>.</p>



<p>Israel has pledged to continue its military operation in Gaza until Hamas’ is defeated, in what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/07/netanyahu-hamas-cease-fire-demands-00140182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has described as “absolute victory.”</a></p>



<p>Many countries want to see a “political solution in which the rights of Palestinians are more respected,” Campbell added. “I don’t think it’s ever been more difficult than right now, but I still believe that the commitment is there.”</p>



<p>Separately, national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed to reporters Monday that while the U.S. will continue to offer its advice to Israel, it is a sovereign country that will make its own decisions.</p>



<p>“Their leadership is choosing how to prosecute this war. They’re going to make those decisions,” Sullivan said. “With the question of a strategic endgame, I don’t think that’s really a question about American influence. That’s a question about Israel’s strategy and what Israel chooses to do.”</p>



<p>Those remarks come as Israel continues its devastating military operation across the Gaza Strip. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have fled the southern city of Rafah as Israeli troops conducted targeted operations over the past weeks to root out militants hiding there.</p>



<p>Israel’s military operation has also dealt a blow to the country’s reputation on the world stage. On Sunday,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/12/2024/egypt-israel-icj-south-africa-gaza-rafah" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egypt joined South Africa in its case</a>&nbsp;in front of the International Court of Justice alleging that Israel has committed genocide in the enclave.</p>



<p>The Palestinian death toll in Gaza has reached more than 35,000 in seven months due to Israel’s military operation, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said Monday.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the last three decades, we’ve enjoyed the luxury of not having to ask ourselves what it is we stand for. But those times have passed.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Jan Jambon is the minister-president of the government of Flanders and the Flemish minister for foreign affairs and culture.</em></p>



<p>One of the many apocryphal stories about Winston Churchill took place just after he’d become prime minister of Great Britain, as the Blitzkrieg was still raging in France and the war’s outcome for allied forces seemed uncertain at best. Isolated in his belief that Britain would repel the Nazis and ultimately be prevail, Churchill presided over an unruly Cabinet meeting, where he was advised to relocate British assets to safer locations in the vast empire: The ministries to Australia, the monarch and his family to Canada, the treasury to the Caribbean…</p>



<p>Churchill refused it all, calmly but decisively. Until, that is, someone suggested they at least evacuate the museums and transport the precious artworks to Canada. He banged his fist on the table: “Then what would we be fighting for?” he asked.</p>



<p>Dutch-Italian writer Ilja Leonard Pfeiffer recalled this story during the conference on “Culture, Heritage and Identity in Europe,” which I organized in April as president of the EU Culture Council. And however historically dubious the tale may be, the fact that we retell it again and again to convince ourselves of the value and worth of culture, speaks for itself.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, when all the economic, technocratic and political arguments for European construction have been made, we ask ourselves: When push comes to shove, is this what we will be fighting for? The answer is probably no.</p>



<p>Even the late Jacques Delors, former president of the European Commission and a great advocate for European integration, noted that one doesn’t fall in love with an internal market, a euro symbol or any other piece of legislation. There must be something more — something that unites us all, however diverse the peoples of the Continent are. And we all know that there is.</p>



<p>As an economic and political structure, the EU’s constructed upon rather technocratic foundations. And though extremely effective in their execution, EU policies never seem to spark much enthusiasm from their millions of beneficiaries. On the contrary, the bloc can hope for popular apathy at best, outright hostility at worst. And yet, the majority of Europeans identify themselves as just that: European.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-531573930-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4737648" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-531573930.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-531573930.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On the contrary, the bloc can hope for popular apathy at best, outright hostility at worst. And yet, the majority of Europeans identify themselves as just that: European. | Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>There is a European identity that crosses borders. An identity that expresses itself in hundreds of distinct cultures, that transcends the boundaries of time and space and connects every European — from Ireland and the British Isles to the trenches of Ukraine, from the ancient times until today.</p>



<p>Europe isn’t just the haphazard result of a chain of historical coincidences. I firmly believe that underneath the European ideal lies a metacultural framework, which arose out of three foundational traditions that, over time, resulted in what we now call a European culture.</p>



<p>The first is the birth of our political thinking in Ancient Greece — especially the conception of democracy in Athens. The idea that each citizen has the right to speak their mind, cast their vote and take office originated in this grand old city. And generations of political thinkers have turned to Athens as an inspiration for democracy as rule of the people, by the people, for the people.</p>



<p>However, Athenian democracy was fundamentally flawed. Rule by unchecked popular opinion resulted in polarization, demagogy and political instability that, in turn, led to the decay of democracy and eventually tyranny.</p>



<p>This brings me to our second tradition of Roman statesmanship. Rome was never a democracy — not in the Athenian sense nor in our modern understanding of the concept. But for much of its history it wasn’t the oligarchic regime we make it out to be either. The popular classes were a major political power and they played a decisive role in the Roman decision-making process on numerous occasions. However, they were kept in check by a complex set of rules that assured the state wasn’t torn apart by private political interest. Roman thinking about citizenship, community and freedom — however narrow in its application — brought us the rule of law we consider sacred today.</p>



<p>And this leads to the value and dignity of each individual human being, which we owe to a third foundational tradition: Judeo-Christian heritage. Our basic human rights have become so self-explanatory and evident that we’ve forgotten just how revolutionary they were. Our modern understanding of morality, and its codification as universal human rights, grew out of teachings such as the meek shall inherit the earth, turning the other cheek and loving thy neighbor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-1717156197-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4737462" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-1717156197.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-1717156197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">And this leads to the value and dignity of each individual human being, which we owe to a third foundational tradition: Judeo-Christian heritage.  | Patrick Smith/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a process that’s lasted over 2,000 years, Europeans have been constantly reinterpreting and renegotiating these traditions in a cultural dialogue that’s resulted in the democracy, rule of law and individual liberty we hold so dear. Of course, this process wasn’t without its faults — our history is tarnished by shortcomings and imperfections. Still, however flawed our predecessors may have been, they kept the ideal alive and strove to better themselves. And the driving force behind this was a cultural understanding of Europe — not a political or economic one.</p>



<p>Our heritage and cultures all reflect this ongoing historical process, which will never conclude as long as the idea of Europe remains.</p>



<p>Even today, we’re still involved in a cultural debate that addresses these foundational traditions; current artistic practices are still vastly influenced by them — even if critical in their approach — and although we seem to have abandoned the classical education system that was very much based on them, every European has a notion of these traditions.</p>



<p>One need only take a stroll through cities like London, Paris, Prague or Berlin to understand how we were inspired by a greatness that encouraged us to go beyond ourselves. We can see the passion of past generations burning in cathedrals, statues, squares and bridges — wherever we are in Europe. But instead of worshiping the ashes, it’s down to us to pass on the flame.</p>



<p>The EU has always shunned the debate on culture and identity. Not only because it’s an exclusive competence of member countries — as I believe it should be — but primarily because it’s considered a divisive factor rather something that unites us. Many bureaucrats in the Berlaymont recall in terror the 2004 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/may/25/eu.religion" target="_blank">debates about the reference to Christianity</a> in the failed European Constitution.</p>



<p>However, it’s my conviction that the time has come to talk about identity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-56652170-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4737522" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-56652170.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-56652170.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">One need only take a stroll through cities like London, Paris, Prague or Berlin to understand how we were inspired by a greatness that encouraged us to go beyond ourselves. | Sean Gallup/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>That’s why last Monday, I hosted the informal meeting of the bloc’s ministers of culture at the Antwerp Museum of Fine Arts to discuss the role of culture, heritage and identity in Europe — precisely because I’m convinced we must invigorate our metacultural framework now more than ever.</p>



<p>The EU has enjoyed a long period of prosperity, peace and security — a period where there were few external threats to the Continent itself, and internal upheavals and economic crises didn’t pose an existential threat to the bloc. But times have changed. We’re now engaged in a strategic competition with China, uncertainty envelops the Atlantic alliance and Russia’s regime is an outright military menace that challenges the stability of European democracies.</p>



<p>In the last three decades, we’ve enjoyed the luxury of not having to ask ourselves what it is we stand for. But those times have passed. And, unfortunately, it’s once again time to pose the Churchillian question: What are we fighting for?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company he keeps: Labour leader shrugs off complaints about drift to the right as he courts votes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LONDON — Lately, Labour leader Keir Starmer is finding friends in the most unlikely places.</p>



<p>Two Tory MPs crossed the floor and defected to the Labour Party within a fortnight, an extremely rare event in British politics.</p>



<p>Now some of the party&#8217;s activists — and even its parliamentarians — are raising objections to the company Starmer keeps, accusing him of drifting to the right. But with one eye on the forthcoming general election expected this fall, his strategists are clear their pleas will fall on deaf ears.</p>



<p>The defection of Dan Poulter, a former Conservative health minister, raised some eyebrows because of his active opposition to a recent strike by doctors, which many Labour MPs on the left of the party found objectionable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that was nothing compared to the row that greeted the decision of Natalie Elphicke, the Tory MP for Dover, to switch sides.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elphicke was, by any measure, firmly on the right of the Conservative Party, known for her punchy attacks on her Labour rivals and her calls for tougher action on illegal immigration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even more uncomfortable for some of her new comrades, she had publicly defended her ex-husband Charlie Elphicke, who in 2020 was jailed for sexual assault, and was forced to apologize for trying to influence a judge in his trial. <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/tory-natalie-elphicke-defection-sparks-backlash-labour-women/">Female Labour MPs told POLITICO</a> there was “a lot of unease” over accepting someone with “abhorrent” views.</p>



<p>She has since apologized for her past actions, and any continued unhappiness among Labour MPs over her admission now seems confined to the back burner. </p>



<p>Both MPs criticized Sunak&#8217;s Conservative government — but the fact they felt they would be more at home in Starmer&#8217;s Labour Party underlines the leadership&#8217;s determination to appear palatable to former Tories in the wider electorate.</p>



<p><strong>Friends like these</strong></p>



<p>Starmer’s welcome for the former Tory MP is not the only improbable alliance the Labour Party has struck in recent months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nick Boles, a former Conservative MP who was part of former Tory Prime Minister David Cameron’s inner circle, has been advising Labour, and even introduced Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves at a speech last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, met allies of Donald Trump as well as senior Democrats on a recent visit to Washington, and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-misunderstood-uk-labour-party/">pronounced that the ex-president had been &#8220;misunderstood&#8221;</a> over his commitment to NATO. It was a far cry from his previous comments about Trump before he was a member of Starmer&#8217;s top team, when <a href="https://time.com/5333087/david-lammy-trump-uk-visit/" target="_blank">he described the then-president as a &#8220;neo-Nazi-sympathizing sociopath.&#8221;</a></p>



<p>Even former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a bogey figure for many on the left, is not safe from the clutches of Labour&#8217;s top tier, with Lammy and Reeves <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/margaret-thatcher-david-lammy-visionary-labour-united-kingdom/">both going out of their way</a> lately to praise her as a “visionary” leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scarlett Maguire, director at JL Partners, said while most voters would not follow the MP defections closely, any reputational damage would likely fall more on the Conservative Party “because it affirms this idea that they&#8217;re in their dying days and they&#8217;ve got lots of infighting.”</p>



<p>She added that Starmer and his team are “very willing to have this fight over Starmer being right wing” because Labour&#8217;s “whole strategy revolves around either winning over or not scaring away people who voted Conservative in 2019.”</p>



<p>One person close to discussions about Labour’s ethics strategy said the party had “made a calculated decision around the political gains versus what was going to come [in terms of backlash].”</p>



<p><strong>How’s it going down?</strong></p>



<p>While Labour soars in the polls, the fruits of Starmer’s wider strategy will not be known for certain until the next election.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Elphicke’s defection has caused real resentment among her new colleagues, stoked further by reports in the Sunday Times that <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/natalie-elphicke-lobbied-lord-chancellor-husband-charlie-kv68bvd7f" target="_blank">she lobbied the former Justice Secretary</a> Robert Buckland on her ex-husband’s behalf.</p>



<p>Nadia Whittome, an MP on the left of the party, <a href="https://twitter.com/NadiaWhittomeMP/status/1788600133573095628" target="_blank">posted on X</a>: “I am deeply concerned by Natalie’s past comments and I’m unconvinced that her politics have changed sufficiently for her to represent our party.”</p>



<p>Such sentiments are not confined to the left, however. “She is no more a Labour MP now than she ever was,” another Labour MP on the right, granted anonymity to speak frankly, told POLITICO after Elphicke’s apology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A third MP, who is a shadow minister, said: “Those who were already very unhappy about the defection are getting angrier.”</p>



<p>Kate Maltby, a commentator and anti-harassment campaigner, <a href="https://inews.co.uk/opinion/labour-has-squandered-its-chance-to-become-the-party-of-ethical-standards-3048442" target="_blank">warned Starmer against &#8220;squandering&#8221; his chance</a> to become the party of ethical standards. </p>



<p>Yet the Labour leader and his top team appear undeterred from staking their claim to the moral high ground, with Shadow Commons Leader Lucy Powell due to give a speech Tuesday accusing the Tories of &#8220;downgrading and degrading&#8221; trust in politics.</p>



<p>According to one member of the Women’s Parliamentary Labour Party Whatsapp group, several people posted messages expressing outrage at the Sunday Times revelations then swiftly deleted them — apparently wary of the messages being leaked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seems that even those in the party who have serious concerns about decisions made by the leadership have learned to prize unity, or the appearance of it, above all else — meaning that for now, Starmer seems free to befriend whom he likes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In EU election, Dublin addresses a Continent-wide problem.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DUBLIN — For most of her young life, Keile Sheridan Odanza didn’t care about voting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I never thought I needed to,” said the 24-year-old beautician from the port city of Waterford. </p>



<p>It wouldn’t have mattered if she had: Sheridan Odanza was homeless. After a childhood spent moving between foster families, she marked her 18th birthday by being cast out on the street.</p>



<p>It took her years to find stable housing, watching as the homelessness crisis went from bad to worse. By the time she found fixed accommodation,&nbsp; a short-term lease run by a nonprofit organization, she wanted a say about the matter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The last election, we got false hope. We got told that they were going to solve the housing crisis, they were gonna do more houses,” she said bitterly, condemning the ruling Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil coalition, who have dominated Irish politics since the 1930s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We need a proper government in charge that is actually gonna help.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the center of Dublin, the pavements are peppered with rough sleepers, the result of a stark housing shortage that has<a href="https://www.focusireland.ie/knowledge-hub/latest-figures/" target="_blank"> quadrupled</a> the number of homeless people to almost 14,000 within a decade. </p>



<p>Until recently, these men and women were politically voiceless, ignored by candidates and absent from the electoral list. </p>



<p>Across most of Europe the rule is: no address, no vote.</p>



<p>That’s different this time. On June 7, Ireland’s homeless people will be casting their ballots in the EU election, the first such event since a reform in 2022 that allowed charities to provide unhoused people with an address, which is necessary to vote. That isn’t a place they can reside though, only vote from. </p>



<p>Still, activists and experts say this opportunity for homeless voters could force lawmakers to address a growing crisis at a time of spiraling housing and living costs, and thrust this demographic onto the European Union stage.</p>



<p>“The fact there is a homelessness crisis isn’t even on the news. It’s not ‘trending’ [and] that’s why you don’t hear what politicians are doing,” said James Flanagan, a 20-year-old electrical engineer, who volunteers for Focus Ireland, the NGO organizing the campaign.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-1074611046-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4739079" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-1074611046.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-1074611046.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On June 7, Ireland’s homeless people will be casting their ballots in the EU election, the first such event since a reform in 2022. | Paul Faith/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>Flanagan&#8217;s first memories are of sleeping in cars with his mother. When he was six years old, the two moved into NGO-supported housing while they waited for a council flat, spending the past 14 years there, only moving out in April.</p>



<p>&#8220;The homeless and housing crisis is the biggest problem in society in recent years and I want to use my vote to try to drive action on this issue,&#8221; said Flanagan, a month into his role spearheading the non-profit’s registration drive, targeting the nearly 70,000 people in emergency and social housing, as well as the thousands more sleeping rough.</p>



<p>Catherine Keenan, a 53-year-old grandmother, signed up to vote with her sons last month. “It gives me back a bit of power and a bit of hope that things will change,” she said. After fleeing an abusive relationship and having two children taken into care, Keenan slept outside train stations, hospitals and a stone bench outside the local council.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A lot of power was taken away from me,” she remembered from her charity-owned flat in Dublin, where she cares for an adult son with autism. “But maybe if I vote they’ll do something for me and my family, you know.”</p>



<p>The charity won&#8217;t reveal how many people have registered so far, but they&#8217;re confident most of those that do will actually vote and are hopeful even a small turnout will force the issue onto the political agenda, particularly as the housing crunch gets ever tighter.</p>



<p>But that could be a tall order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s [also] that thing of ‘why would I bother when society rejects me?’” added Connor Roe, manager at Stanhope Green, the long-term accommodation that Flanagan just moved out of.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Housing hell</h2>



<p>Those hunting for a place to sleep in the Irish capital will regale listeners with nightmarish stories about flat hunting, from the multi-round application process and street-length queues for viewings, to the university lecturers camping in tents and that one colleague who was offered a bed for €650 per month — to be shared with a stranger.</p>



<p>In recent years, to compound both the homeless and housing issues, the government has been unable to manage a large influx of migrants and refugees who must also be housed, leaving some to set up encampments in the Irish capital. </p>



<p>“It’s been allowed to become a runaway train, with vulture funds buying a lot of the new builds,” said Martin Leahy, a 48-year-old musician who has been protesting outside Ireland’s Senate every Thursday since April 2022. Facing possible eviction and likely homelessness, Leahy comes each week to play songs.</p>



<p>“Some peoples’ misery, other peoples’ gain. Enrich the rich and make them richer,” he crooned, strumming his guitar. “They see property as opportunity, a business that’ll make the sickness sicker. If they build too many houses, it’ll drive down the price. It’s cold economics to them. So there’s no way to address it, it’s not in their interest, we’ve seen it over time and time again.”</p>



<p>It’s an outlook rejected by Senator Mary Fitzpatrick, the spokesperson on housing for Ireland’s&nbsp; centrist governing party Fianna Fáil, who stood a few hundred feet away from Leahy’s one-man demo. Fianna Fáil has controlled the ministry of housing and local government since 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-1074611034-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4739094" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-1074611034.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-1074611034.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">People walk past murals painted on a boarded-up property, depicting eviction. | Paul Faith/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>“We&#8217;ve put in place a 10 year plan: Housing for All. The plan is to deliver 300,000 homes by 2030, to eliminate homelessness by 2030. It is backed in this government&#8217;s [five-year] term with €20 billion in state funding,” she said. “So it’s huge: It’s the biggest change to housing policy in decades [and] I don’t know of any other European country that has taken such a significant initiative.”</p>



<p>Ask civil society groups though and they’ll tell you of the Fianna Fáil government selling off whole estates after the 2008 financial crash. That was followed by a decade of center-right Fine Gael, one of the two traditional main parties alongside Fianna Faíl, leaving housing provision to the private sector, even as Big Tech snapped up real estate and Airbnb decimated long-term rentals.</p>



<p>In January, then-Taoiseach Leo Varadkar quietly admitted there was a deficit of around<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2023/03/08/varadkar-reveals-deficit-of-250000-homes-in-state-admitting-crisis-will-take-time-to-solve/" target="_blank"> 250,000</a> homes, which would take years to resolve. Median house prices sit at €430,000 in Dublin, while rental apartments average €1,513 per month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That made the Irish capital the third most expensive European city to rent in last year, behind only Geneva and London, according to an<a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2024/02/20/where-are-europes-most-expensive-cities-for-renters" target="_blank"> index</a> compiled by The Economist. Adjusted for local wages, Dublin was the fifth least affordable city, following other notorious money burners like Budapest, Prague, Lisbon and Zagreb.</p>



<p>Many who spoke to POLITICO, both homeless and housed, are certain the issue will define the EU election – and the polls bear that out. Housing is the top issue identified by the Republic of Ireland’s 5 million people, outpacing migration, cost-of-living and healthcare by a wide margin, according to the latest <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2024/04/29/housing-the-top-issue-with-voters-when-asked-what-they-have-noticed-about-what-the-government-is-doing/" target="_blank">data</a> by Ipsos.</p>



<p>“It’s very important to talk about this, not in the way of ‘oh, I’m a victim,’ but [because] we need to take action on this,” said Jenny Lopez, a 38-year-old homeless mother in charity-owned housing.</p>



<p>Most seem to agree with Sheridan Odanza, the beautician, who delivers her answer like a body blow. “I want to vote for a party that&#8217;s gonna actually help solve the homeless crisis,” she snapped.</p>



<p>Like the majority of her compatriots, this June she is backing a party that has never been in government, a once-radical alternative that is now the most popular force in both Ireland and the British territory of northern Ireland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m voting for Sinn Féin,” she said proudly, referencing the leftist party long kept at bay from mainstream politics for historic links to the Irish Republican Army and its use of violence in the Northern Ireland conflict that ran from the 1960s to 1990s.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">EU on notice</h2>



<p>European politicians have taken note.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of The Left group in the European Parliament, Sinn Féin are enjoying a remarkable run that has them polling at 28 percent, miles ahead of Fine Gael’s 18 percent and Fianna Fáil’s 15, according to POLITICO’s<a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/ireland/"> Poll of Polls</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is in large part down to the housing crisis and the reverberating repercussions of the 2008 financial crisis and pro-business policies of the ruling coalition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Your government’s failure to deliver the affordable homes needed to rent and buy is at the heart of the problem,”<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ie/news/other/government-blasted-on-housing-as-almost-one-in-two-say-theyve-postponed-buying-a-home/ar-BB1m2p2Z?ocid=BingNewsSearch" target="_blank"> thundered</a> leader Mary Lou McDonald in parliament last week, while berating recently-appointed Taoiseach<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/who-is-simon-harris-irelands-first-millennial-leader-has-come-a-long-way-quickly/"> Simon Harris</a>. She referred to a new<a href="https://news.myhome.ie/myhome-living/challenging-outlook-for-government-as-housing-supply-concerns-persist-32308" target="_blank"> survey</a> showcasing that only 5 percent of people think the government is doing enough to help renters, the bulk of the electorate.</p>



<p>Figures like these have bolstered support for Sinn Féin, with<a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/the-journal-ireland-thinks-poll-eu-elections-simon-harris-6351045-Apr2024/" target="_blank"> another poll</a> finding that half of local council renters, over a third of those living at home with parents, and a quarter of private renters plan to choose them during the EU election.</p>



<p>“They want to stop the homeless [crisis],” insisted Sheridan Odanza, explaining that all her friends and family want to vote for them too.</p>



<p>Last month’s<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lXgbp48gHI&amp;t=642s&amp;ab_channel=POLITICOEurope" target="_blank"> Maastricht debate</a> saw several would-be chiefs of the European Commission mention the issue, with The Left’s lead candidate Walter Baier calling for a regulatory framework to limit platforms like Airbnb and for directives to enshrine the right to affordable housing and introduce country-by-country rental price caps.</p>



<p>“The housing crisis exactly is one of the examples of the unjust current system which we are in,” the Austrian communist told audience members at the POLITICO-organized event.</p>



<p>There is increasing talk in Brussels of the need for a housing commissioner and housing policy wonks are increasingly being hired by the Berlaymont, according to Mike Allen, Vice President of the European Federation of National Organisations working with the Homeless (FEANTSA).</p>



<p>“That [growing role] has also followed into homelessness,” he said.</p>



<p>In March, Flanagan and Sheridan Odanza traveled to Brussels to speak about their experiences and were immediately appointed to the &#8216;expert by experience&#8217; committee for the European Platform for Combatting Homelessness.</p>



<p>“I want to get it out to the whole world, especially the EU,” that everyone deserves to vote and no one deserves to be homeless, reflected Flanagan.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[European Broadcasting Union says Anders Vistisen cannot debate because the far right does not endorse the Spitzenkandidat system.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>BRUSSELS — The organizer of the scandal-hit Eurovision Song Contest is facing another controversy after excluding the far right from a debate in the European Parliament next week due to disagreement over how the EU should nominate the European Commission president.</p>



<p>The European Broadcasting Union invited five political factions — the far left, Greens, socialists, liberals and center-right — to take part in its big debate on May 23, two weeks before the EU election, when voters will choose 720 MEPs and kick off negotiations for the most powerful jobs in the bloc&#8217;s institutions.</p>



<p>But neither the far-right Identity &amp; Democracy faction — on course to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/european-parliament-election/">be the third-largest force in the assembly, according to POLITICO’s Poll of Polls </a>— nor the hard-right European Conservatives and Reformists will be allowed to take part, due to their refusal to nominate an official candidate to be president of the Commission, a role currently held by Ursula von der Leyen, who is seeking a new term.</p>



<p>“We see there is a censorship [by] the European public broadcasters,” said Anders Vistisen, a Danish far-right MEP, who represented ID at a debate hosted by POLITICO and Studio Europa in Maastricht in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The exclusion of ID will embolden the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ridiculous-own-goal-brussels-mayors-give-europe-hard-right-nationalists-free-hit-before-eu-election/">right-wing argument</a> that it is undemocratically barred from important roles in the Parliament, where a <em>cordon sanitaire</em> blocks it from chairing committees and leading legislative negotiations. </p>



<p>And it&#8217;s not just within the Parliament that the far right feel excluded: Last month, three Brussels politicians attempted to shut down the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ridiculous-own-goal-brussels-mayors-give-europe-hard-right-nationalists-free-hit-before-eu-election/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/ridiculous-own-goal-brussels-mayors-give-europe-hard-right-nationalists-free-hit-before-eu-election/">National Conservatism Conference</a>, a meeting of Europe’s hard right featuring Nigel Farage and Viktor Orbán. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-2147852064-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4739127" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-2147852064.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-2147852064.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Last month, three Brussels politicians attempted to shut down the National Conservatism Conference, a meeting of Europe’s hard right featuring Nigel Farage and Viktor Orbán. | Simon Wohlfahrt/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>The EBU sent an email — shared with POLITICO by Vistisen — to senior politicians in ID on May 7 stating that it cannot field someone in the debate because it has not officially endorsed a lead candidate to be the president of the next Commission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vistisen himself has certainly acted like a potential Commission president — even if his chances of making it are nil: He opened his Maastricht <a href="https://twitter.com/POLITICOEurope/status/1784994383843950734" target="_blank">debate speech</a> by outlining his plan to sack 10,000 EU civil servants, starting with von der Leyen.</p>



<p>But ID has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/eu-election-playbook/keeping-it-on-the-vdl-ursula-the-reluctant-campaigner/">not formally described him</a> as a <em>Spitzenkandidat</em>, a German word meaning &#8216;lead candidate&#8217;. The term refers to an informal convention, used by most political factions in the Parliament since 2014, that gives the legislature more clout in electing the Commission president. </p>



<p>ID and ECR reject the <em>Spitzenkandidat</em> process as an overreach by the Parliament which, according to the EU treaties, has no right to nominate a candidate for Commission president.</p>



<p>“I think the whole system of <em>Spitzenkandidat</em> has become a joke,” said Philip Claeys, the secretary general of the ID group in the Parliament.</p>



<p>ECR did nominate a <em>Spitzenkandidat</em>, Czech MEP Jan Zahradil, in 2019.&nbsp;But it has not done so this time.</p>



<p>The lead candidate plan blew up after the 2019 election, when MEPs narrowly confirmed von der Leyen in the top Commission job at the expense of the European People’s Party’s Manfred Weber — the winning <em>Spitzenkandidat </em>— despite having pledged to support only a lead candidate for the bloc’s most powerful role. </p>



<p>It was widely interpreted as a sign that the real power to choose the Commission president still lies with national government leaders gathered in the European Council — which has made no progress implementing an electoral law reform that MEPs have clamored for. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No such thing as a Spitzen</strong></h3>



<p>There are no hard-and-fast rules about what constitutes a real lead candidate. </p>



<p>Even von der Leyen has been denounced by rivals as a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-fake-spitzenkandidaten-lead-candidate-ex-parliament-chief-martin-schulz-european-election/">“fake” <em>Spitzenkandidat</em></a>, given that she is not running as an MEP and is therefore not directly electable. Her main rival, the Socialists&#8217; lead candidate Nicolas Schmit, is also not running as an MEP, breaking with the tradition set by his two predecessors, Martin Schulz and Frans Timmermans.</p>



<p>Other parties have put forward more than one candidate for the single-person role: The Greens, for example, have put forward MEPs Bas Eickhout and Terry Reintke. </p>



<p>The liberals nominated three candidates, all of whom ruled out running for the job of Commission president at their campaign launch event. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-2151732660-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4739130" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-2151732660.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-2151732660.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas also slammed the EBU’s decision to ban EU flags during Saturday’s final, describing it as a gift to “the enemies of Europe.&#8221; | Johan Nilsson/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even politicians who oppose the far right criticized the EBU’s decision not to allow them to debate. “I would not exclude them, no,” said Domènec Ruiz Devesa, a Spanish socialist MEP who is an EU federalist, and who wants the <em>Spitzenkandidat</em> system to work in tandem with a new EU-wide constituency of MEPs who can be elected by all voters. </p>



<p>An EBU spokesperson wrote in an email: “Two parties …[ECR and ID] … have not nominated lead candidates for the Presidency of the European Commission and are therefore not eligible to take part in the Debate.”</p>



<p>A senior Parliament official said this was a matter for the EBU and the political parties, and said nothing has changed compared with debates held in 2014 and 2019. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Long week for EBU</h3>



<p>The EBU has had a challenging week. This year’s Eurovision, held in Malmö, Sweden was one of the most contentious in its history, overshadowed as it was by conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine and elsewhere.</p>



<p>Ahead of the final, thousands of protesters gathered in Malmö, many waving Palestinian flags. When&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eurovision-crowns-swiss-singer-nemo-tensions-israel-gaza-dutch-disqualification/">Israel’s contestant, Eden Golan, took the stage</a>, she received a mixture of boos and cheers.</p>



<p>Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas also slammed the EBU’s decision to ban EU flags during Saturday’s final, describing it as a gift to “the enemies of Europe.&#8221;</p>



<p>“It’s mind-blowing, what the EBU did,” Schinas told <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/catalans-vote-out-pro-independence-parties/">POLITICO&#8217;s Brussels Playbook</a>. Schinas wrote EBU chiefs on Monday asking for an explanation, according to a letter seen by POLITICO. </p>



<p>The commissioner said the EBU’s decision for “the first time” to exclude flags other than those of participating countries was ill-timed given next month&#8217;s European election, and at a time when thousands of Georgian protesters were massing in the streets of Tbilisi in support of the democratic values the EU represents.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Changing the defense ministry leadership signals that Russia's president is "preparing for many more years of war."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Andrei Belousov hasn&#8217;t served a day in the Russian military — but the selection of the dour economist to head the defense ministry shows Vladimir Putin intends to win the war by grinding down Ukraine in a protracted arms race.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Putin&#8217;s priority is war; war of attrition is won by economics,” Alexandra Prokopenko, a former adviser at Russia’s central bank, <a href="https://twitter.com/amenka" target="_blank">wrote </a>on X.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/vladimir-putin-fires-russia-defense-intelligence-chiefs-sergei-shoigu-nikolai-patrushev/">Putin made the surprise reshuffle</a> late Sunday, kicking longtime Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu upstairs to head Russia’s National Security Council instead of top hawk Nikolai Patrushev.</p>



<p>The seed for Shoigu&#8217;s sacking was arguably planted when Russia’s blitzkrieg plan to conquer Ukraine failed miserably more than two years ago.</p>



<p>It will have germinated after last year&#8217;s uprising led by warlord <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/yevgeny-prigozhin-killed-plane-mutiny-wagner-group-kremlin-vladimir-putin-russia/">Yevgeny Prigozhin</a>, who railed against corruption and mismanagement among the top brass and singled out Shoigu by name during his abortive march on Moscow.</p>



<p>And it appears to have finally blossomed last month when Shoigu’s deputy, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/bribery-case-puts-russian-defense-minister-sergei-shoigu-in-the-crosshairs/">Timur Ivanov, was arrested for taking bribes</a>.</p>



<p>Shoigu, an engineer who also had no military background before taking over the defense ministry in 2012, had a penchant for fancy medal-bedecked uniforms and oversaw Russia&#8217;s notoriously corrupt procurement process. Ivanov was even known as &#8220;Shoigu’s wallet” for his widely known ability to extract rivers of cash from military contracts.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dour economist</h3>



<p>Belousov cuts a starker figure. </p>



<p>He dresses in dark suits and — unusual among top Kremlin officials — doesn&#8217;t have a reputation as deeply corrupt.</p>



<p>In the late 1990s, Belousov was a rare advocate of state control in the economy at roundtable discussions on macroeconomics generally dominated by younger and progressive liberals.</p>



<p>“But among those old-school proponents of old-school ideology, he stood out for understanding the data and actual competence rather than just proclaiming a salad of words,” Konstantin Sonin, a professor at the University of Chicago who often overlapped with Belousov in that period, told POLITICO.</p>



<p>That view of the state running the economy is increasingly relevant in a Russia geared for war, where making tanks, bombs, missiles and jets is elbowing aside other production.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,height=683,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-2151585115.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4739967"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> At 6.7 percent of GDP, military spending in Russia was nearing Soviet-era levels.&nbsp;| Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov <a href="https://ria.ru/20240512/peskov-1945466531.html" target="_blank">said</a> as much on Sunday. The decision to appoint Belousov as defense minister, he noted, is linked to the need to  &#8220;mak[e] the economy of the security bloc part of the country’s economy.&#8221; </p>



<p>“Today on the battlefield, the victor is the one who is more open to innovation, more open to the most rapid implementation,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>He added that at 6.7 percent of GDP, military spending in Russia was nearing Soviet-era levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under Belousov, a Keynesian statist, that figure is expected to only increase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a career in academia, Belousov served as minister of economic development for a year before being appointed Putin’s economic adviser in 2013.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2020 he has been first deputy prime minister — high in the political hierarchy.</p>



<p>Russian media outlet the Bell <a href="https://dsmirmvjycfqnjia.aswmu6ocnb.site/gosudarstvennik-v-koltse-vragov-chto-sovetuet-putinu-andrej-belousov" target="_blank">cited</a> an official in 2018 as saying that Belousov, unlike Putin’s other economic advisers, believed Russia was “encircled by enemies,” and that he backed Moscow’s illegal 2014 annexation of Crimea.</p>



<p>In media interviews Belousov comes across as straight-laced and a religious conservative, an image which aligns with Putin’s own pious public persona.</p>



<p>Crucially, over the years he’s proven his loyalty to Putin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He considers himself to be just like a soldier, you do what you’re ordered to do,” Sonin said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Belousov will have the job of fine-tuning Russia&#8217;s military-industrial complex, which is trying to out-produce Ukraine&#8217;s slow-moving allies, any actual military strategizing is likely to be done by Valery Gerasimov, the chief of general staff, under strict oversight of Putin himself.</p>



<p>“The real defense minister is Putin,” <a href="https://twitter.com/MikhailFishman/status/1789768437687820712" target="_blank">writes</a> Russian opposition journalist Mikhail Fishman.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,height=688,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/13/GettyImages-1245766591.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4739928"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Any actual military strategizing is likely to be done by Valery Gerasimov, the chief of general staff, under strict oversight of Vladimir Putin himself. | Mikhail Kireyev/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Missing minister</h3>



<p>Meanwhile, opinions differ on the scale of  Shoigu’s fall from grace. </p>



<p>As head of the National Security Council, Patrushev was seen to have real clout. But with a diminished Shoigu taking over, some predict the security body will go back to being a retirement home for Putin loyalists.</p>



<p>The meaning of the reshuffle will become clearer once it&#8217;s known what new role awaits Patrushev and who will fill the Ivanov-shaped hole at the defense ministry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then there’s the issue of Gerasimov and whether he hangs on as Russia&#8217;s top general despite his lackluster record in leading the war against Ukraine. </p>



<p>Among Putin’s cheerleaders, skepticism over the appointment of someone with no military know-how was quickly drowned out by proclamations of loyalty to the president.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We trust our commander-in-chief,” military blogger Alexander Sladkov <a href="https://t.me/Sladkov_plus/10449" target="_blank">told</a> his more than 900,000 followers in a voice message on Telegram. “I’m sure everything has been thought through.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for Shoigu, after more than a decade in the job, his departure was met with near-total indifference.</p>



<p>As one pro-Kremlin blogger <a href="https://t.me/milinfolive" target="_blank">put it</a>: “There are a lot of things I want to say but mainly: By failing in the special military operation in Ukraine, Shoigu failed the most important test in his life.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russia&#8217;s replacement of an incompetent defense minister with a less bad one isn&#8217;t good news for Ukraine, however.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shoigu&#8217;s replacement with a (relatively experienced and apparently competent) economist pretty clearly signals Putin believes victory in Ukraine will come via outproducing (and outlasting) Ukraine and her Western allies,&#8221; Jimmy Rushton, a Kyiv-based security analyst, <a href="https://x.com/JimmySecUK/status/1789733103038034276" target="_blank">said on X</a>.  &#8220;He&#8217;s preparing for many more years of war.&#8221;</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s not obvious that more spending is the golden bullet Putin is looking for.</p>



<p>“Putin thinks he can win the war by adjusting some small things like arms, the economy, discipline, perhaps another mobilization campaign,” Sonin said.&nbsp;“But the problem is much larger than [one] that can be fixed by appointing Belousov.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oleg Itskhoki, an economics professor at the University of California, said other factors like the oil price that props up Russia&#8217;s budget, as well as military aid to Ukraine, are more important to the course of the war than whatever Belousov will be able to do as minister. </p>



<p>“The United States has influence over both and Russia entirely depends on this, while who will run the military, the Central Bank, and the treasury in Russia is of less consequence,” he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[University staff denounced "extreme" violence by police toward student protestors.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Riot police armed with batons intervened in a pro-Palestine demonstration at the University of Amsterdam (UvA) on Monday, the latest in a series of clashes between police and protestors at Dutch universities.</p>



<p>Students and staff organized the walkout of universities across the Netherlands on Monday morning, calling for the Dutch institutions to end their complicity in “the ongoing genocide” in Gaza and denouncing violent methods that the police used to suppress peaceful protesters.</p>



<p>“The National Walkout protest that started peacefully has unfortunately turned into an occupation&#8221; of the UvA&#8217;s Roeterseiland campus building, the university said in a statement, <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/content/news/news/2024/05/uva-buildings-roeterseiland-closed-lectures-roeterseiland-will-not-go-ahead.html" target="_blank">calling on protestors to leave the building</a>. </p>



<p>Police were called to the site by UvA, who reported destruction by demonstrators.</p>



<p>Sarah Bracke, professor of sociology of gender and sexuality at UvA, said on X that she and her colleagues were <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahABracke/status/1788314707851436466" target="_blank">“horrified” by the actions of the university’s executive board</a>.</p>



<p>“For three consecutive days, they have authorised extreme police violence towards their own staff and students, who were engaged in non-violent protest on campus against UvA&#8217;s complicity in the ongoing genocide in Gaza,&#8221; the statement read.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are shocked the absolute disregard, disrespect and general unwillingness of the Board towards its students and staff.&#8221;</p>



<p>Last Monday evening, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/08/pro-palestine-student-protests-campuses-europe-arrests-police" target="_blank">Dutch police arrested over 100 people</a> when breaking up an encampment at the university. </p>



<p>In recent weeks, protests against Israel&#8217;s assault on Gaza have taken place <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/french-government-calls-out-us-import-as-pro-palestinian-student-protests-spread/">on campuses around Europe</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As the two-year war enters a critical phase, Ukraine’s second city Kharkiv is in Putin’s sights.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ukraine’s second city Kharkiv and its surrounding area are facing an intense wave of attacks from Vladimir Putin’s invading troops. The signs are that this surge marks the start of a decisive battle that will be critical to the outcome of the war.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At stake is not just control of one of Ukraine’s major population centers but potentially the country’s capacity to keep fighting: If Kharkiv falls, Western resolve may soon follow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russian forces have long been expected to make a major attempt to break through Ukrainian lines in May or June. It now seems clear that this push is under way, with Putin apparently keen to take advantage of a window before more Western ammunition and weapons arrive to help Ukraine’s military fight back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Sunday, Russia launched a two-pronged dawn attack in the area, and a fierce battle is now raging for control of a group of 30 towns and villages across an arc 30 kilometers north of Kharkiv.&nbsp;Some local officials told Ukrainian media Monday that&nbsp;poorly built fortifications&nbsp; are allowing the Russians to make advances.</p>



<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ordered the evacuation of nearly 6,000 people from the region. Kharkiv’s governor warned the delay to sending Western ammunition had given Russia an advantaged and weakened Ukraine’s defenses in the area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zelenskyy issued a defiant message, saying that while the fighting was “fierce,&#8221; reinforcements had been sent. “We are adding more forces to Kharkiv. Both along our state border and along the entire front line, we will invariably destroy the occupier in a way that will disrupt any Russian offensive intentions.&#8221;</p>



<p>The head of the Kharkiv Regional Military Administration, Oleh Syniehubov, said while the &#8220;situation is indeed quite difficult,&#8221; the area is &#8220;fully controlled by our troops.&#8221;</p>



<p>But Russia’s defense ministry claims its forces have captured five villages and inflicted 1,500 casualties on Ukraine in recent fighting.  </p>



<p>The claims both sides are making over the opening exchanges of what is likely to be long drawn-out battles over the coming months can’t be independently verified.</p>



<p>A spring offensive by the Russians had always been expected but some Ukrainian officials and independent analysts argue it may have been brought forward with Moscow keen to exploit its advantage in weapons and soldiers ahead of resupplies from the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Western weapons</h2>



<p>Those replenishments are starting to flow after the U.S. Congress finally approved a multi-billion-dollar aid package that had been stalled by Republicans on Capitol Hill. The delay allowed Russia to regain the initiative.</p>



<p>The head of Ukraine’s ground forces,<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/05/10/ukraine-will-hold-if-it-gets-the-arms-it-needs-says-a-top-general" target="_blank">&nbsp;Gen. Oleksandr Pavliuk remains confident that Ukraine can hold the line</a>, saying that Russia is throwing as much as it can now at the assault in the north-east and in Donetsk. “Russia knows that if we receive enough weapons within a month or two, the situation can turn against them.”</p>



<p>But Pavliuk appeared to be readying Ukrainians for setbacks, arguing that the city of Chasiv Yar isn’t strategically important, describing it as a “regular urban settlement.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And on Monday Zelenskyy replaced the Ukrainian commander in the northeast without explanation, amid mounting criticism that the defensive lines and fortifications hastily built&nbsp; north of Kharkiv in the past few weeks are substandard, with too many gaps. </p>



<p>Some senior Ukrainian military officers are not sure Ukraine will be able to block Russia from making significant territorial gains. A significant Russian breakthrough could trigger renewed pressure from some European quarters for Kyiv to enter peace talks.</p>



<p>Last month several senior officers talked to POLITICO on the understanding they would not be named so they could talk freely. <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-great-risk-front-line-collapse-war-russia/">They painted a grim forecast of frontlines potentially collapsing</a>&nbsp;when Russia, with greater weight of numbers and a readiness to accept huge casualties, launches its expected offensive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps worse, they expressed private fears that Ukraine’s own resolve could be weakened, with morale in the armed forces undermined. The fear is that Putin’s bet is paying off on grinding down Ukrainian resistance and exhausting Western support for Kyiv.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Softening up</h2>



<p>Russian commanders have been preparing their offensive for months, and for weeks have been softening up Ukraine. Away from the frontlines Russia has maintained relentless missile and drone attacks targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.</p>



<p>Putin’s forces attacked 106 infrastructure facilities in nine regions in Ukraine on May 11, according to the Defense Ministry&#8217;s Military Media Center, leaving thousands of households without power. Ukrainian officials say the Russians likely have two goals in mind with the attacks: to undermine Ukrainian morale and to disrupt arms manufacturing.</p>



<p>On the frontlines it isn’t yet clear where the Russians will focus. “Russia is testing the stability of our lines before choosing the most suitable direction,” according to Pavliuk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zelenskyy’s team have long&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-tells-donald-trump-to-emulate-reagan-as-putin-readies-major-spring-offensive/">expected a big Russian push on Kharkiv</a>. “It’s symbolic because they say that Kharkiv was the first capital of Ukraine. It’s a big target,” Zelenskyy said in a recent interview with POLITICO’s parent company Axel Springer media outlets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S.-based think tank, argues that Russian forces have been ordered to shape a buffer zone along the border and push towards Kharkiv.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Routine indirect fire, in combination with continued glide bomb and missile strikes, would likely be intended to set conditions for a larger offensive effort against Kharkiv city at a later date,” the institute said. But Russia doesn’t have to try to capture the city to control it.</p>



<p>The institute warned the city of 1.8 million will be in range of artillery if Russian forces are able to advance another dozen kilometers from their current positions. But trying to overrun the city would be a monumental task for the Russians — let alone maintaining an occupation.</p>



<p>Beyond Kharkiv, one risk Ukraine is facing is that Putin makes another attempt to take the area around the capital. As a precaution Ukrainian officials are planning to reinforce Kyiv.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Five of the 10 new brigades to be raised in the coming weeks will be deployed to protect the capital. But that strikes at one of the main criticisms of Zelenskyy and his government recently – namely that it has been slow to prepare for the Russian offensive and has only belatedly accepted that raising more troops is crucial.</p>



<p>With the guns of May now booming that attitude has changed. A new law, which comes into effect this week, gives greater powers to enlistment officers and will make life harder for draft dodgers, with penalties including freezing their bank accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This situation, when some people are fighting at the front lines while others are living their quiet lives, is obviously coming to an end,” Dmitry Lazutkin, a defense ministry spokesman, told Ukrainian television station Espresso. “With such an enemy as Russia, the whole country needs to mobilize,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Report provoked a flurry of questions for the British government Monday afternoon.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LONDON — Britain insisted its position on a Ukrainian peace deal has not changed after a report that the country&#8217;s top diplomat floated an agreement with Russia in a meeting with Donald Trump.</p>



<p>British Foreign Secretary David Cameron met Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in April to try to convince the presidential contender to endorse more military aid to Ukraine in the face of Republican resistance. </p>



<p>Citing a &#8220;senior source,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-lammy-shows-yen-trump-whisperer-us-visit-xmpxhvg58" target="_blank">The Sunday Times newspaper</a> reported this weekend that Cameron had argued fresh aid would help Ukraine hold its front lines — and give Trump the &#8220;best possible conditions&#8221; to try and secure a deal between the warring sides.</p>



<p>According to the paper&#8217;s source, Cameron asked Trump: &#8220;What are the best conditions in which you as president can make a deal in January? It’s both sides holding their lines and paying a price for that.”</p>



<p>That would be a far cry from the official U.K. line, and the report prompted a flurry of questions in Westminster on Monday.</p>



<p>The British government has long argued that a peace deal is a matter for Ukraine — and Cameron himself has publicly said &#8220;peace comes through strength, not through appeasement and weakness.&#8221;</p>



<p>Pressed by reporters Monday afternoon, a spokesperson for U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Britain&#8217;s position on the war had not changed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t recognize those reports &#8230; our position has not changed. Putin must fail,&#8221; the spokesperson said. </p>



<p>&#8220;It is crucial, now more than ever in this conflict, that Putin is sent a very clear message that we will support Ukraine for as long as is necessary,&#8221; they added.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen some anonymous source briefing. We do not recognize those reports,&#8221; the spokesperson reiterated when asked to directly reject the Sunday Times story.</p>



<p>Sunak was also pushed on the report after a speech in central London Monday.</p>



<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen this Sunday Times article, so forgive me for that,&#8221; Sunak said. &#8220;But what I can tell you is that you we have led when it comes to Ukraine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Investment in Ukraine&#8217;s security is investment in our security. Our NATO allies are already worried about the prospect of if Putin succeeds, that they&#8217;ll be next — with all the consequences that would bring,&#8221; the British prime minister added.</p>
