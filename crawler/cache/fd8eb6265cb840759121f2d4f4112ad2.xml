					<description><![CDATA[European Public Prosecutor's Office looking into texts between Ursula von der Leyen and boss of Pfizer.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Top European prosecutors are investigating allegations of criminal wrongdoing in connection with vaccine negotiations between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the CEO of Pfizer, according to a<strong> </strong>spokesperson from the Liège prosecutor&#8217;s office. </p>



<p>Investigators from the European Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office (EPPO) have in recent months taken over from Belgian prosecutors investigating von der Leyen over &#8220;interference in public functions, destruction of SMS, corruption and conflict of interest,&#8221; according to legal documents seen by POLITICO and a spokesperson from the Liège prosecutor&#8217;s office.&nbsp;While EPPO’s prosecutors are investigating alleged criminal offenses, no one has yet been charged in connection with the case.</p>



<p>The probe was originally opened by Belgian judicial authorities in the city of Liège in early 2023 after a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/criminal-complaint-frederic-baldan-european-commission-president-ursula-von-der-leyen-pfizer-albert-bourla-coronavirus-vaccine/">criminal complaint</a> lodged by local lobbyist Frédéric Baldan. He was later joined by the Hungarian and Polish governments — although the latter is in the process of withdrawing its complaint after the election win by a pro-EU government led by Donald Tusk, a Polish government spokesperson told POLITICO.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Baldan’s complaint centered around an alleged exchange of text messages between von der Leyen and Pfizer boss Albert Bourla in the run-up to the EU’s biggest vaccine deal at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, in an affair dubbed “Pfizergate.” </p>



<p>The New York Times, which first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/world/europe/european-union-pfizer-von-der-leyen-coronavirus-vaccine.html" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the exchange had taken place as the two leaders hashed out the terms of the deal, has launched a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/new-york-times-sue-european-union-ursula-von-der-leyen-pfizer-texts/">parallel lawsuit</a> against the Commission after it refused to disclose the content of the messages following an access to documents request.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>News that EPPO is now investigating the case risks putting further scrutiny on the Commission president&#8217;s role in the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/covid19-european-commission-ursula-von-der-leyen-pfizer-the-eu-and-disappearing-ink/">mega vaccine deal</a>, which had an estimated value of over €20 billion. EPPO leads pan-European investigations into financial crimes, and in theory could seize phones and other relevant material from Commission offices or in other countries in Europe such as von der Leyen&#8217;s native Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The development comes at a delicate moment for the EU’s chief, as she navigates the transition to what Brussels observers expect will be a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-second-term-european-commission-president/">second term</a> at the head of the Berlaymont.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Commission has so far refused to reveal the content of the text messages, or even confirm their existence. </p>



<p>The deal, negotiated at the height of the pandemic in 2021, was originally seen as a triumph for von der Leyen. But the sheer amount of vaccines purchased has since raised eyebrows, with POLITICO revealing late last year that there were at least <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-bonfire-covid-vaccines-coronavirus-waste-europe-analysis/">€4 billion</a> worth of wasted doses. The vaccine contract with Pfizer has since been <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-pfizer-renegotiate-coronavirus-vaccine-contract/">renegotiated</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/secrecy-around-von-der-leyens-vaccine-texts-hurting-eu-reputation/">Transparency campaigners</a> and some <a href="https://twitter.com/Lega_gruppoID/status/1773027869360288120?s=20" target="_blank">political opponents</a> have sought to put pressure on the Commission to discuss the case, but von der Leyen has so far avoided addressing it. In a reply to a direct question put to her by POLITICO about missing text messages, von der Leyen <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/politico-eu-influence/uber-files-postmortem-2/">said</a>: “Everything necessary about that has been said and exchanged. And we will wait for the results.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.eppo.europa.eu/en/news/ongoing-eppo-investigation-acquisition-covid-19-vaccines-eu#:~:text=The%20European%20Public%20Prosecutor's%20Office,made%20public%20at%20this%20stage." target="_blank">2022</a>, EPPO announced it was looking into the EU’s vaccine procurement more generally, but this is the first time that the office has been linked with Pfizergate explicitly. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Trading legal barbs&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The case now being looked at by EPPO brings together several different legal, political and financial strands — and it intersects with lawsuits that pharmaceutical giant Pfizer brought against Hungary and Poland.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/29/GettyImages-1365349654-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4519077" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/29/GettyImages-1365349654.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/29/GettyImages-1365349654.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The sheer amount of vaccines purchased since the vaccine deal has since raised eyebrows, with POLITICO revealing late last year that there were at least €4 billion worth of wasted doses. | Sean Gallup/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>Last year, Baldan, a 36-old Belgian lobbyist with ties to vaccine-skeptic group Bon Sens, lodged a criminal complaint in Belgium in connection to von der Leyen’s role in the vaccine negotiations with Pfizer over what he alleges were acts of &#8220;interference in public functions, destruction of SMS, corruption and conflict of interest,&#8221; according to legal information provided by his lawyer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The addition of European governments to his complaint adds weight to what might otherwise have been seen as a personal crusade. Hungary, led by Viktor Orbán, a steadfast opponent of von der Leyen, also filed a complaint in connection to the Commission president’s role in vaccine negotiations with Pfizer, according to two insiders with knowledge of the case, speaking on condition of anonymity because of its sensitivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Poland lodged its own complaint last November, a Polish government spokesperson confirmed. However, following the election of Tusk in December, “the new government is working [to] withdraw Poland from these proceedings,” the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The details of the case are not public but the insiders said that while the complaint brought by Hungary is distinct from Baldan’s, it centers on the same text message exchange. Poland’s complaint was along the same lines, the two people familiar with the details of the case said.</p>



<p>Both Hungary and Poland are also <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/pfizer-biontech-sues-hungary-pandemic-court-cases-mount-covid-19/">being sued by Pfizer</a> over missing payments for vaccine doses after stopping deliveries, citing oversupply and the financial strain of the Ukraine war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A European Commission official said the Commission had no knowledge about possible proceedings other than from press articles. </p>



<p>The Hungarian government didn&#8217;t reply to a request for comment. Pfizer and EPPO declined to comment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The message revived old grudges against his legal nemeses.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Former President Donald Trump’s Easter Sunday message on Truth Social consisted of seven words about Easter and 161 complaining about the legal system and various enemies of his.</p>



<p><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112191452263257064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The all-caps message</a>&nbsp;began “HAPPY EASTER TO ALL” and ended “HAPPY EASTER EVERYONE!” but it otherwise consisted of attacks on those leading the legal cases against him, including Special Counsel Jack Smith, Fulton County (Ga.) District Attorney Fani Willis (whom he brands as “MRS. FANI “FAUNI” WADE) and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, with a secondary swipe at President Joe Biden and the Justice Department.</p>



<p>Descriptive words in the message include “EVIL,” “SICK” (which appears in quotes), “DERANGED” (also in quotes), “CORRUPT,” and “CROOKED,” which shows up twice. The post also includes “ILLEGAL” and “ILLEGALLY.”</p>



<p>Trump has been indicted on 91 charges in various cases, though he has yet to be convicted on any of them.</p>



<p>The post was not unusual for a holiday greeting from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. His posts last year on Christmas Eve and Christmas covered similar terrain with one ending “IT’S CALLED ELECTION INTERFERENCE. MERRY CHRISTMAS!” Another message concluded: “MAY THEY ROT IN HELL. AGAIN, MERRY CHRISTMAS!”</p>



<p>Trump’s jam-packed TruthSocial feed Sunday also included derogatory material about Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), who is set to retire from the House in April, as well as Judge Arthur F. Engoron and Judge Juan Merchan — and Merchan’s daughter. There were also polling stories and a photo of him receiving a golf trophy from Jack Nicklaus, winner of 18 major championships and perhaps the most accomplished golfer of all time. Trump boasted last week that he had won championships at his club in West Palm Beach, Florida.</p>



<p>In contrast, Biden posted Sunday: “Jill and I send our warmest wishes to Christians around the world celebrating Easter Sunday. Easter reminds us of the power of hope and the promise of Christ’s Resurrection.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/31/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-easter-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Biden’s message ended</a>: “From our family to yours, happy Easter and may God bless you.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In short — and let me be blunt — if governments aren’t prepared, or are unwilling, to turn words into action, the entire strategy will be useless.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Rabbi Menachem Margolin is the chairman of the European Jewish Association, which represents hundreds of Jewish Communities across the Continent.</em></p>



<p>Part of my job as a rabbi is to inspire, to show my fellow Jews beauty in the seemingly mundane. It is to rally, lead and keep the flame of Judaism alight — a flame that’s endured for thousands of years despite repeated efforts to extinguish it.</p>



<p>But with reported or documented cases of antisemitism through the roof since the Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel — in <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/spains-jewish-community-denounces-the-biggest-increase-in-anti-semitism/" target="_blank">Spain</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2024/01/25/anti-semitic-acts-in-france-quadrupled-in-2023_6463787_7.html" target="_blank">France</a> <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/london-police-report-1353-rise-in-antisemitic-hate-crimes-since-hamas-onslaught/amp/" target="_blank">and the U.K.</a>, the rise is over 1,000 percent<strong> </strong>— my role has become even more challenging, to say the least.</p>



<p>“Never again.” Everybody knows these words. But what exactly do they mean? No more concentration camps? No more mass murder? One would certainly hope so.</p>



<p>And what about never allowing the circumstances that led to Nazi barbarity happen again? Does “never again” mean that too? The Jewish communities across Europe certainly hope so.</p>



<p>But it appears we’re laboring under misapprehension.</p>



<p>Back in 2021, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic and a worrying rise in antisemitism across the Continent, <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/combating-antisemitism/eu-strategy-combating-antisemitism-and-fostering-jewish-life-2021-2030_en" target="_blank">the European Commission published a detailed strategy for combating antisemitism</a>. The strategy was handed to member countries, which, in turn, were to adopt measures and develop national plans — and many did. A great many also signed up to <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/combating-antisemitism/definition-antisemitism_en" target="_blank">the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism</a>, patting themselves on the back for doing so.</p>



<p>Of course, we welcomed this.</p>



<p>But any strategy must ultimately pass a “real-world” test. So, how have these strategies and plans held up in the post-Oct. 7 landscape?</p>



<p>Earlier this year in the Netherlands, Holocaust Memorial Day events at universities were cancelled due to security worries and vociferous opposition to memorialization. And just recently in Amsterdam, there were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/10/amsterdam-holocaust-museum-an-overdue-reckoning-with-history" target="_blank">protests at the opening of a new Holocaust Museum</a>.</p>



<p>Across many the Continent’s capitals — and it must be said, mainly in those with significant Muslim populations — there are now regularly occurring protests where one can see Nazi images referring to Jews and images drawing parallels between Gaza and Auschwitz; one can hear calls for Jewish genocide and ethnic cleansing “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFb-FfPwMgI" target="_blank">from the river to the sea</a>.”</p>



<p>Across Europe, one can find placards calling Jews terrorists; the blood libel of child killers is used regularly; death threats against rabbis are common; Jews are insulted on the street daily; and our children are cursed at. Europeans who have served in the Israel Defense Forces are outed in their communities via letter campaigns, saying a “child killer” is living next door to them. Flights arriving from Israel are tracked and met by protesters, and the Jewish Community President in Porto takes his child to nursery wearing a bullet proof vest.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,height=768,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/30/GettyImages-2105322312.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4519773"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Posters from the &#8220;We will survive&#8221; collective pasted on a wall on Chaussee d&#8217;Antin street in the 9th arrondissement with slogans repeating anti-Semitic prejudices such as &#8220;they say the Jews control the world and you?&#8221; or &#8220;they say the Jews are rich and you?&#8221;, in Paris | Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>These are just a few of the many, many examples of daily life for Jews in Europe today. And they answer any questions regarding the worth of all the plans and strategies that were put in place.</p>



<p>Regrettably, these measures currently have no visible or demonstrable practical application across Europe. Or, as one Dutch Jewish community president put it: “They aren’t worth the paper they’re printed on.”</p>



<p>So, what’s happening in the real world? Police departments are hamstrung in the face of openly antisemitic protests, unsure, and therefore unable, to stop public manifestations of hate. The courts, too, seem to have little to no framework available when it comes to prosecuting the antizionists and antisemites who have made our collective Jewish life here in Europe hell.</p>



<p>The result? Jew haters are emboldened because they can act with impunity.</p>



<p>Today, the number one cost for Jewish communities is security. Jews are largely on their own, footing the bill for private security and equipment — funds that could be used for Sunday schooling, community development or holiday celebrations. I should also add here that the EU just put out a call for funding the security of Jewish institutions, but the bloc’s bureaucracy is often so cumbersome that — as one prominent rabbi put it — “it’s like asking someone to fill out a lengthy insurance form while your house is on fire.”</p>



<p>In short — and let me be blunt — if governments aren’t prepared, or are unwilling, to turn words into action, all the plans and IHRA adoptions, the entire strategy will be useless.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Olivier Véran and Nick Clegg are just two of the ex-politicians who've gone off to make the big bucks. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Who says politics is for life?</p>



<p>While some politicians cling to power as long as they can, others decide that a life of public service is not all it’s cut out to be. Sometimes, they simply retire. Other times, they find another calling.</p>



<p>We looked at a few former politicians who traded their careers and found new (sometimes lucrative) passions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Doctor Botox</strong></h3>



<p>Olivier Véran, a former French government spokesperson and ex-minister of health, <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/la-nouvelle-vie-d-olivier-veran-a-la-reconquete-des-macronistes-perdus-a-gauche-20240317" target="_blank">recently announced his next career venture</a> at the Clinique des Champs-Élysées in Paris. For Véran, who was a neurologist before turning to politics, going back to medicine is not all that surprising. What was shocking — and <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2024/03/20/la-reconversion-d-olivier-veran-de-neurologue-a-medecin-esthetique-le-symbole-est-terrible_6223030_3224.html" target="_blank">caused some uproar</a> in the medical community — was his decision to join a high-end clinic specializing in cosmetic medicine and surgery. Véran was quick to defend his choice, saying he won’t perform cosmetic surgery procedures, focusing instead on aesthetic medicine. “I won&#8217;t touch penises or buttocks, and I&#8217;ll be very far from breast implants,&#8221; <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/je-serai-tres-loin-des-protheses-mammaires-veran-s-explique-sur-sa-reconversion-dans-la-medecine-esthetique-20240321" target="_blank">he promised.</a> That didn&#8217;t stop <a href="https://www.lepoint.fr/sante/olivier-veran-se-reconvertit-dans-la-chirurgie-esthetique-21-03-2024-2555628_40.php" target="_blank">Le Point</a> from christening him &#8220;Doctor Botox.&#8221; </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Facebook flack</h3>



<p>Former U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has found a niche — and the big bucks — in Silicon Valley. As president of global affairs at  Meta, he handles the company&#8217;s relationships with governments, a thankless task in an era when Facebook has become synonymous with political disinformation. In 2021, the Guardian dubbed him the &#8220;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/14/insufficient-very-defensive-how-nick-clegg-became-fall-guy-facebook-failures" target="_blank">fall guy</a>&#8221; for the company&#8217;s troubles.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Honey, honey</strong></h3>



<p>A former French economy minister, socialist Arnaud Montebourg got creative with his post-politics endeavors. After resigning in 2014 and trying — <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/29/europe/french-elections-hamon-valls/index.html" target="_blank">without success</a> — to win the Socialist nomination for the presidential election in 2017, Montebourg turned to … honey. In 2018, he founded <a href="https://www.bleu-blanc-ruche.fr/" target="_blank">“Bleu, Blanc, Ruche”</a> (“Blue, White, Beehive”), a company that produces and sells 100 percent French-made honey while focusing on bee repopulation. And he’s seemingly pretty good at it: <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/entreprises/fondateur-de-bleu-blanc-ruche-arnaud-montebourg-remporte-un-prix-au-salon-du-made-in-france_AV-202111120409.html" target="_blank">He won the environment prize</a> at the 2021 &#8220;Made in France&#8221; exhibition.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Welcome to Hollywood</h3>



<p>Former U.S. President Barack Obama has been raking in cash thanks to lucrative speaking engagement that command <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/barack-obama-speeches-fee-wall-street-latest-a7954156.html" target="_blank">fees of up to €370,000 per speech</a>. He signed a multimillion dollar book deal for his memoir &#8220;A Promised Land,&#8221; which became an international bestseller. Together with his wife, former First Lady Michelle Obama, he also launched a movie production company in 2018, which has produced content for Netflix, and a podcast in an exclusive partnership with Spotify. Those ventures have allowed the Obamas to live a very comfortable lifestyle — especially considering Obama already gets a €200,000 annual pension that is allotted to former presidents. However, Obama&#8217;s exorbitant speech fees have come under fire from both political allies and opponents. To quote Senator Bernie Sanders: &#8220;It just does not look good.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Russian oil guru</h3>



<p>Once lauded for refusing to join the U.S. in the Iraq war and reducing unemployment in Germany, former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder has since <a href="https://praxistipps.focus.de/gerhard-schroeders-vermoegen-so-reich-ist-ist-der-ex-kanzler_161942" target="_blank">earned millions</a> promoting Russian energy interests.

So, it wasn’t much of a surprise when Schröder joined the shareholder committee of the Russian-controlled Nord Stream company, reportedly earning about €250,000 a year. From 2017, he presided over the board of the Russian oil company Rosneft until <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/gerhard-schroder-to-leave-rosneft/">he stepped down</a> in May 2022 after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A lobbyist, duh</h3>



<p>Once a rising star in conservative Europe, Sebastian Kurz became Austria’s youngest chancellor at the age of 31 in 2017. His four years in power were marked by <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/the-house-of-sebastian-kurz-scandal-explained-austria-chancellor-perjury-allegations/">scandals and corruption allegations</a>, and now he is working as a lobbyist for <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/09/20/peter-thiel-book-facebook-trump-jd-vance-blake-masters-josh-hawley-513121" target="_blank">American tech billionaire Peter Thiel</a> — a co-founder of Paypal and <a href="https://www.nzz.ch/international/midterms-der-investor-peter-thiel-unterstuetzt-trumps-kandidaten-ld.1706059" target="_blank">onetime supporter of former U.S. President Donald Trump</a> — reportedly <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/austria-former-chancellor-sebastian-kurz-palantir-technologies-silicon-valley-peter-thiel/">earning €300,000 </a>a year.

In February, Kurz was found <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/sebastian-kurz-charged-on-suspicion-of-making-false-statements/">guilty of perjury</a>, damaging his chances of a return to politics — something he might not be keen on anyway, considering the negative impact it might have on his more lucrative projects.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Opposition's triumph in Istanbul, where the president had invested significant electoral resources, boosts a party that was left reeling by a general election defeat last year.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan suffered a major blow on Sunday, with initial results showing the country’s main opposition party notched up regional election victories around the country.</p>



<p>The opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) held onto or captured the country’s five biggest cities in Sunday’s vote, which <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/recep-tayyip-erdogan-ekrem-imamoglu-turkey-istanbul-election-country-future/">had been seen as a make-or-break moment</a> for a movement still reeling from Erdoğan’s victory in the Turkish presidential contest in May 2023.</p>



<p>The CHP saw its biggest triumph in Istanbul, where Ekrem Imamoğlu was reelected mayor. Europe&#8217;s biggest city, Istanbul accounts for 18 percent of Turkey’s population and a third of its economy. </p>



<p>In his victory speech delivered late Sunday, Imamoğlu said the local election results would have big implications for the country’s political future.</p>



<p>“Turkey will blossom into a new era in democracy as of tomorrow. March 31, 2024 is the day when democratic erosion ends and democracy begins to recover,” he told a big crowd in Istanbul. </p>



<p>Imamoğlu is seen as a future challenger to Erdoğan, and winning the city which catapulted the current president to national prominence when he won the mayorship 30 years ago is a symbolic achievement.</p>



<p>Erdoğan conceded defeat and promised to listen to the message delivered by Turkish voters. “March 31 is not an end for us, but a turning point,” he said.</p>



<p>Turkey&#8217;s long-serving leader — in office as president or prime minister since 2003 — had vowed to recapture the city where he had made his political career, and sent no fewer than 17 government ministers to campaign in Istanbul ahead of voting.</p>



<p>The CHP also won in Turkey’s capital, Ankara, as well as Izmir, Bursa and Adana, pushing its support to 37.4 percent nationwide with more than 90 percent of the votes counted.</p>



<p>Erdoğan’s Islamist-based AK party trailed on 35.7 percent, losing conservative strongholds including Adıyaman, Afyonkarahisar and Zonguldak.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/31/GettyImages-2127921660-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4520775" srcset="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/31/GettyImages-2127921660.jpg 1024w, https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/31/GettyImages-2127921660.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The election consolidated the position of Ekrem Imamoğlu, Istanbul’s reelected mayor. | Chris McGrath/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>Selin Nasi, a visiting fellow at the European Institute of the London School of Economics, said the election suggested economic factors had trumped Erdoğan’s variety of identity politics. </p>



<p>Turkey has been wrestling with sky-high inflation for several years and according to official figures prices are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-inflation-rises-67-keeping-pressure-cenbank-2024-03-04/" target="_blank">still rising by 67 percent a year.</a></p>



<p>“Conservative voters punished the AKP at the ballot box for the cost of living crisis,” Nasi said, adding that the CHP had expanded beyond its coastal strongholds, increasing its vote in Turkey’s Anatolian heartlands.</p>



<p>Nasi added that the election would not only “inject new life into the CHP,” but also consolidate the position of Imamoğlu, who previously won the city’s mayorship twice in 2019 after the authorities annulled his initial election.</p>



<p>“He is the only politician who succeeded in beating Erdoğan three times,” Nasi said.</p>



<p>Imamoğlu swept the megacity with more than 51 percent of the votes, with the AKP’s candidate Murat Kurum<strong> </strong>trailing almost 10 points behind him.</p>



<p>A victory in Istanbul — widely considered a microcosm of Turkey — could have given Erdoğan the political momentum and economic resources to move ahead with his goal to amend the constitution to prolong his time in office.</p>

<p>Utku Çakırözer, a CHP member of parliament, hailed the result as a warning from voters to Erdoğan’s AKP.</p>



<p>“Voters gave a yellow card to the government,” he told POLITICO, arguing that with massive support behind the opposition he now sees early elections as more likely.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Belgium, which holds the Council presidency, is meant to act as an honest broker in talks. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The EU’s flagship nature law is “bad” and needs to be revised after the June European election, Belgium’s prime minister said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bloc&#8217;s Nature Restoration Law, which aims to rehabilitate 20 percent of the EU’s degraded land by 2030, is in limbo after a ministerial vote <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/177600" target="_blank">had to be postponed</a>.</p>



<p>Belgium steers the talks on the legislation as the country currently holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU. This means the Belgian government is expected to act as an honest broker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in an interview <a href="https://www.dezondag.be/actua/politiek/premier-alexander-de-croo-open-vld-ons-land-heeft-een-nieuw-politiek-verhaal-nodig/" target="_blank">with De Zondag</a>, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said the bill “may sound good, but it is a bad law.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He added: “I am not against a law that protects our nature, on the contrary. I am against bad legislation. … This needs to go back to the drawing board. Let us find out carefully in the next legislature how we should approach this.”</p>



<p>Alain Maron, the environment minister of the Brussels region, <a href="https://twitter.com/alainmaron/status/1774391156115140884" target="_blank">said</a> De Croo’s comments were “unworthy of a President of the Council.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pointing out that the European Parliament and EU governments had reached an agreement on the law last year, Maron added: “The [law] deserves determination, not weakness.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maron, a Green politician, presided over last week’s environment ministers’ meeting where the bill was meant to be adopted. The Belgian presidency postponed the vote after it became clear that the law did not have the required majority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Belgium was already planning to abstain in any vote on the law, as there was no consensus among its regional governments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nature Restoration Law “will create more uncertainty,” De Croo argued. “Will people still be able to build and do business? …&nbsp; It may mean that you can hardly build and that land that is currently used for agriculture is taken away.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>During negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council, requirements for restoring agricultural land <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/177600" target="_blank">were made voluntary</a> for farmers and private landowners.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Rep. Tim Walberg said he really wasn’t advocating using nuclear weapons.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.) on Sunday said that his recent comment that the war in Gaza should “be like Nagasaki and Hiroshima” was not meant to be taken literally.</p>



<p>The reference by Walberg came in a town hall meeting last week, invoking the nuclear bombings by the United States of Japan that led to Japan’s surrender at the end of World War II, according to a video clip&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4PQ47OEU0Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on YouTube</a>.</p>



<p>“I don’t think any of our aid that goes to Israel to support our greatest ally, arguably maybe in the world, to defeat Hamas and Iran and Russia, and probably North Korea’s in there, and China, too, with them helping Hamas — we shouldn’t be spending a dime on humanitarian aid. It should be like Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Get it over quick. The same should be in Ukraine. Defeat Putin quick,” Walberg can be heard saying in the roughly three-minute clip of the meeting in Dundee, Michigan, posted online.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/RepWalberg/status/1774420222620950574?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement posted</a>&nbsp;on social media Sunday, the Michigan Republican said that the comment was metaphoric.</p>



<p>“As a child who grew up in the Cold War Era, the last thing I’d advocate for would be the use of nuclear weapons. In a shortened clip, I used a metaphor to convey the need for both Israel and Ukraine to win their wars as swiftly as possible, without putting American troops in harm’s way,” Walberg said.</p>



<p>“My reasoning was the exact opposite of what is being reported: the quicker these wars end, the fewer innocent lives will be caught in the crossfire. … The use of this metaphor, along with the removal of context, distorted my message, but I fully stand by these beliefs and stand by our allies,” Walberg continued.</p>



<p>Walberg’s remarks come as the situation in Gaza grows increasingly dire. The death toll in the besieged region has reached over 30,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and 70 percent of the people living there are experiencing catastrophic hunger,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/famine-is-imminent-in-northern-gaza-with-70-percent-of-people-experiencing-catastrophic-hunger-un-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the United Nations</a>. Israel has been fighting in Gaza since Oct. 7, when Hamas launched a deadly incursion into the country, killing 1,2000 and taking others hostage.</p>



<p>Michigan, which Walberg represents, is home to some of the country’s most prominent Arab American cities, as well as Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian American woman to serve in Congress.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Paris would send 'hundreds' of vehicles over the next year, Sébastien Lecornu tells La Tribune Dimanche. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>France will send new surface-to-air missiles and old armored vehicles to Ukraine, the country’s defense minister said on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sébastien Lecornu <a href="https://www.latribune.fr/economie/france/j-exige-la-constitution-de-stocks-pour-produire-des-munitions-sebastien-lecornu-ministre-des-armees-994261.html" target="_blank">told La Tribune Dimanche</a> that President Emmanuel Macron had asked him to design a “new aid package” to help Kyiv defend against Russia&#8217;s invasion.</p>



<p>This will “notably include old equipment from our armies, which is still functional,” he said. “To hold such a long frontline, the Ukrainian army needs, for example, our armored vehicles —&nbsp;this is absolutely key for troop mobility and is part of Ukraine’s requests.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked how many vehicles France would provide, Lecornu said: “We&#8217;re talking in the hundreds for 2024 and early 2025.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He said France would also provide a “new batch of Aster 30 missiles” to Ukraine.“We are also developing <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/1-dead-russia-launches-attacks-094915932.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.yahoo.com/news/1-dead-russia-launches-attacks-094915932.html" target="_blank">remotely operated munitions</a> in a very short timeframe, for delivery to the Ukrainians as early as this summer,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The arms deliveries come amid accusations —&nbsp;by Germany in particular —&nbsp;that Paris is not pulling its weight on military aid to Ukraine. German officials have publicly <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-aid-france-strikes-back-and-publishes-weapons-data-macron-kiel-taurus-scalp/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-aid-france-strikes-back-and-publishes-weapons-data-macron-kiel-taurus-scalp/">voiced frustration</a> with the size of France&#8217;s assistance to Kyiv. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has repeatedly called for an audit of national contributions amid discussions on how to calibrate an EU fund for reimbursing countries for their military donations to Kyiv.</p>



<p>Russia <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-hits-ukraines-energy-infrastructure-gas-production-facilities-2024-03-31/" target="_blank">continued hitting</a> Ukraine’s energy infrastructure on Sunday. A Russian missile strike in Ukraine’s western Lviv region on Sunday killed one man, while another man died in an attack in the northeast, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-energy-infrastructure-de446fa5182eb4b1480783b402b01d9b" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-energy-infrastructure-de446fa5182eb4b1480783b402b01d9b" target="_blank">Associated Press</a> reported.</p>



<p>The Ukrainian air force said it shot down nine of the 11 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, as well as nine out of 14 cruise missiles.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands in Ukraine’s Odesa region were left without power Sunday after debris from a downed Russian drone caused a blaze at an energy facility, the AP reported Gov. Oleh Kiper as saying.</p>



<p>Sunday&#8217;s attacks came just days after <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-ukraine-war-missile-attack-damaged-three-power-plants-in-ukraine/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-ukraine-war-missile-attack-damaged-three-power-plants-in-ukraine/">Moscow unleashed</a> 99 missiles and drones in a massive attack against Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Three power plants were seriously damaged in that onslaught, Ukrainian energy company DTEK <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/DTEKcompany/posts/pfbid0RWvEs5SBBi4WfBzu14UE3DpKT36zmwCnVber9DUuHoB48upG6FX7hQrAs7Wo8h2jl" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>



<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday signed a decree setting out the routine <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-signs-decree-spring-military-conscription-2024-03-31/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-signs-decree-spring-military-conscription-2024-03-31/" target="_blank">spring conscription campaign</a>, calling up 150,000 citizens for military service, a post on the Kremlin&#8217;s website indicated on Sunday. All men in Russia are required to serve one year of compulsory military service.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The former president is considering around a dozen contenders, though the list is in flux.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Donald Trump’s aides are vetting potential vice presidential candidates at Mar-a-Lago as the former president floats an expansive list of names in private conversations.</p>



<p>Susie Wiles, a top adviser to Trump, is leading a close-to-the-vest process of narrowing a list of around a dozen lawmakers and other Republican personalities under consideration, according to multiple people familiar with the process. The campaign has already hired an outside firm to vet candidates and prepare research documents. Former first lady Melania Trump, who influenced Trump’s decision to select Mike Pence in 2016, has been kept apprised. And Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. said he speaks with his father frequently about who is in contention.</p>



<p>While who is up or down seemingly changes by the minute, the list has included everyone from Tim Scott and Kristi Noem to Byron Donalds, Elise Stefanik, Tulsi Gabbard and J.D. Vance, whom Trump has called a “fighter.”</p>



<p>Trump, despite saying he doesn’t think the vice president matters all that much, regularly asks guests at his Mar-a-Lago club for their opinion on different options and, with a flair for suspense, teases his choices in private meetings and media interviews. The process is expected to take months.</p>



<p>“He’s going to draw this out ‘Apprentice’-style,” said one person close to the Trump campaign who was granted anonymity to speak freely.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-reveals-criteria-running-mate-name-drops-two-top-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The former president has said</a>&nbsp;his top criterion is picking someone “who is going to be a good president … in case of emergency.” But Trump is also sensitive to electoral needs, and part of the consideration is having someone who can help expand his appeal in November.</p>



<p>The names under consideration continue to be in flux, according to multiple people familiar with the list, who describe it as being in “pencil, not pen.” But it includes Sens. Scott of South Carolina, Vance of Ohio, Katie Britt of Alabama and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as Govs. Noem of South Dakota, Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas and Doug Burgum of North Dakota. Donalds, the Florida representative, and Gabbard, the former Hawaii representative, among others, are also being considered or have been floated by Trump.</p>



<p>Trump seems to relish the guessing game — which has been going on since he announced his third White House bid in November 2022, but has intensified since he clinched the nomination in March.</p>



<p>During one private meeting several weeks ago in Palm Beach, Florida, he went down the list of possible running mates with visitors, including one member of Congress, offering commentary on each. He spoke highly of Stefanik and Gabbard, according to a person with knowledge of the conversation and granted anonymity to speak freely. And he was dismissive of Scott, suggesting the senator may not be up to the job of being president, if needed.</p>



<p>Still, in a sign of his vacillation, Trump spoke positively about Scott as recently as last week, according to a person familiar with a private conversation with the former president. A spokesperson for Scott declined to comment.</p>



<p>“He’ll ask you about people,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), said in an interview.</p>



<p>The senator cautioned that those names being promoted by Trump allies or political consultants should be treated skeptically. “All I can tell you is, if you’re hearing any names, it ain’t going to be them. It’s all propaganda.”</p>



<p>The former football coach said all the name-floating felt familiar: “Like football coaches whenever there’s a job opening, my agent always put my name in there to get me a raise, get me publicity and all that.” Tuberville echoed Trump’s own advisers, who have expressed annoyance at some of the behind-the-scenes maneuverings of consultants.</p>



<p>Kellyanne Conway, the former senior counselor to Trump in the White House, suggested Trump should choose someone who can <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/05/opinion/trump-vice-president.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank"><u>help him win and govern</u></a>, and not be a distraction as he tries to expand his reach to minority voters, women and political independents. Specifically, she said Trump should select someone who can speak about abortion with “conviction and compassion” and articulate what it means to be a “pro-life Republican” versus “pro-choice Democrat” in 2024.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/30/trump-gop-primary-voters-exurbs-00149822" target="_blank"></a>“Unlike the Democrats who are stuck with a wildly unpopular president and vice president, Trump has an embarrassment of riches in terms of who he can choose,” Conway said in an interview.</p>



<p>She added that when Trump is thinking about vice president he is also considering people for other top positions in a potential administration: “The VP is the most important decision, but he is widely focused on personnel all around.”</p>



<p>But everyone has an opinion about the No. 2 job. Trump Jr. said last week that he speaks with his father frequently about the vice presidential selection process and is pushing him to choose a “fighter.” He implicitly criticized Trump’s former vice president, Pence, who declined to support efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p>



<p>“When people didn’t know Trump beyond sort of the TV personality or the business guy, you needed a little more balance. And I think that made a lot of sense with Mike Pence at the time,” Trump Jr. told POLITICO at a rally for Senate candidate Jim Banks in Indiana. “Now, I think we see where our country is, you need someone who’s actually going to fight.”</p>



<p>One contender Trump has viewed in that light is Vance, whom he called a “fighter” at a rally earlier this month.</p>



<p>“I would be interested in doing it if he asked me, but he also hasn’t asked me,” Vance said in an interview. “I don’t think he’s close to asking anybody. So I think it feels extremely premature.”</p>



<p>As he searches for a running mate this year, those under consideration are finding ways to be helpful with the campaign. Scott, for example, talks with Trump by call or text message nearly weekly, according to a person with knowledge of their relationship and granted anonymity to speak freely. The senator is also highly involved as a Trump campaign surrogate on TV.</p>



<p>Scott is making fundraising calls at the Trump campaign’s request and will attend rallies and fundraising events when asked, including appearing with Trump, Burgum and former GOP primary rival Vivek Ramaswamy next weekend at a big fundraiser in Palm Beach.</p>



<p>Burgum, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination, recently traveled to Nevada as a Trump campaign surrogate to speak to Clark County Republicans. He didn’t rule out serving in the Trump Cabinet or as vice president when pressed last week&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6349339412112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>by Fox News host Neil Cavuto</u></a>.</p>



<p>“I talk to the former president, but I know that he’s going to make a choice about his Cabinet and about who’s vice president at the time of his choosing,” Burgum said, adding that his “name has come up for about a half a dozen different Cabinet positions.”</p>



<p>The significance of a running mate on the election’s outcome has long been the subject of debate. Mitt Romney, who ran for president in 2012, seemed to agree with Trump’s skepticism, saying in an interview, “generally vice president picks make no difference” in an election.</p>



<p>“As they say, VP picks can hurt you, they rarely help you,” Romney said.</p>



<p>But any decision could make a difference in a general election that may be determined in a few critical counties across a handful of battleground states. In 2016, Trump selected Pence to give him conservative bona fides and deliver evangelical voters. And beyond helping Trump in 2024, the next vice presidential nominee may also have a leg up in who Republicans nominate in 2028.</p>



<p>“This person will not only be one heartbeat away from the presidency during President Trump’s next term, but will likely be our nominee in ‘28 and serve as president for the next eight years following President Trump’s term,” said Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who speaks to Trump regularly.</p>



<p>One Republican strategist close to Trump’s campaign said each candidate comes with their own set of baggage: “There’s no one that checks every single box that they’re looking for.” Britt, for one, had a widely panned&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/08/katie-britt-sotu-rebuttal-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>State of the Union</u></a>&nbsp;rebuttal, Noem just made a&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/kristi-noem-dentist-video-texas-dc931ee40c4613c3c5effc1dbfc3ba75" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>strange advertisement for veneers</u></a>, and several hopefuls have come across to Trump as too eager, according to two people close to Trump.</p>



<p>Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said Trump “will choose the best possible person for the job and someone who will fight for America First values.”</p>



<p>Trump is expected to make his decision before the Republican nominating convention in July. But it is likely not imminent, and his campaign faces some calendar restraints. Trump will be preoccupied with court appearances for a month this spring.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Trump’s campaign has turned the running mate selection process into a vehicle for their fundraising emails.</p>



<p>As one such email read recently: “Want to know who my VP will be?”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[New analysis suggests Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's party would win just 98 seats in next election. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak&#8217;s Conservative Party is on track to win fewer than 100 seats in the next election, with Labour likely to score a landslide victory, a new poll suggests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A seat-by-seat analysis based on a survey of 15,000 voters sees Sunak’s governing party winning in just 98 constituencies compared to Labour’s 468, the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/general-election-poll-tory-mp-party-cabinet-seats-6ktnbkt7b" target="_blank">Sunday Times reports</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The poll, conducted by agency <a href="https://www.survation.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.survation.com/" target="_blank">Survation</a> on behalf of the <a href="https://www.bestforbritain.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bestforbritain.org/" target="_blank">Best for Britain</a> campaign group, puts Keir Starmer’s Labour Party at 45 percent of the overall vote, a <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/public-stopped-listening-tories-poll-102914900.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/public-stopped-listening-tories-poll-102914900.html" target="_blank">19-point lead</a> over the Tories. </p>



<p>Reform U.K., the right-wing populist party set up by Nigel Farage, would score 8.5 percent and win seven seats, with the Liberal Democrats getting 22 seats, according to the survey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Wales and Scotland, the Conservatives would see a complete wipeout, winning no seats, according to the report. The analysis gives the Scottish National Party 41 seats and Plaid Cymru two seats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The poll did not account for undecided voters, which represented 15 percent of the people surveyed.&nbsp;</p>
