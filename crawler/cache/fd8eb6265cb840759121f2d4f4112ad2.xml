					<description><![CDATA['We are prepared to respond in a swift and coordinated manner' if Tehran sends missiles to Moscow, G7 ministers say. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CAPRI, Italy — The G7 sent a pointed warning to Iran on Friday to refrain from sending ballistic missiles to Russia, saying that such a move would trigger &#8220;new and significant measures against Iran.&#8221;</p>



<p>The warning, issued in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.esteri.it/it/sala_stampa/archivionotizie/comunicati/2024/04/g7-foreign-ministers-meeting-communique-capri-april-19-2024-situation-in-the-middle-east/" target="_blank">communiqué</a> by G7 finance ministers, came just hours after an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/19/israel-limited-strike-iran-00153301" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/19/israel-limited-strike-iran-00153301" target="_blank">Israeli retaliatory strike</a> on Iran. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told reporters in Capri that the United States had been &#8220;informed&#8221; by Israel about the strike at &#8220;the last minute, but there was no involvement on the part of the United States.&#8221;</p>



<p>The G7&#8217;s admonition follows <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-find-way-around-sanctions-battlefield-tech-report/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-find-way-around-sanctions-battlefield-tech-report/">intelligence reports</a> indicating that Iran might replenish Russia&#8217;s depleted stocks of ballistic missiles and related technology. </p>



<p>&#8220;We call on Iran not to do so, as it would represent a substantive material escalation in its support for Russia’s war in Ukraine,&#8221; the G7 text reads. If Tehran were to do so, &#8220;we are prepared to respond in a swift and coordinated manner, including with new and significant measures against Iran,&#8221; the ministers said in the communiqué.</p>



<p>One of the mulled potential sanctions could be flight restrictions to Iran Air, although there are still open legal questions, according to two officials familiar with the discussions who were granted anonymity to discuss private discussions. </p>



<p>The G7 also expressed &#8220;strong concern about transfers to Russia from business in China of dual-use materials and components for weapons and equipment for military production.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Don’t be intimidated by Putin. We aren’t," Charles Michel said in message for Republican front-runner.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>European Council President Charles Michel snapped back at former United States President Donald Trump on Friday, telling him to “get the facts straight” after the Republican standard-bearer said Europe should do more to support Ukraine.</p>



<p>“Don’t be intimidated by Putin. We aren’t,” <a href="https://x.com/CharlesMichel/status/1781270695109861632" target="_blank">Michel told Trump</a> on social media. “Let’s get the facts straight.”</p>



<p>Trump, a prominent NATO skeptic who could return to the White House after the presidential election in November, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-moan-why-europe-not-give-more-money-help-ukraine/">complained about Europe’s contributions</a> to Kyiv Thursday night just as U.S. Congress edges closer to approving new military aid for Ukraine.</p>



<p>“Why isn’t Europe giving <a href="https://twitter.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1781031895553445977" data-type="link" data-id="https://twitter.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1781031895553445977" target="_blank">more money to help Ukraine</a>? Why is it that the United States is over $100 Billion &#8230; into the Ukraine War more than Europe, and we have an Ocean between us as separation!” Trump wrote in post on social media.</p>



<p>Michel did not let the comment slide.</p>



<p>“The numbers speak for themselves,” he clapped back. “EU contribution to Ukraine: €143 billion ($150 billion).”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/why-ukraine-losing-russia-war/">Ukraine is struggling</a>&nbsp;to resist Russian President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion, with Ukrainian President&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/volodymyr-zelenskyy-calls-more-western-air-defense-russias-missile-strike-kills-northern-ukraine/">Volodymyr Zelenskyy urging the West</a>&nbsp;to step up its support as Kyiv&#8217;s forces are running short of critical weapons and ammunition.</p>



<p>Trump has for years accused European NATO allies of relying on Washington to provide protection against hostile foreign powers, and has badgered them to spend more on defense. </p>



<p>The EU and its members have&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ifw-kiel.de/fileadmin/Dateiverwaltung/Subject_Dossiers_Topics/Ukraine/Ukraine_Support_Tracker/Methodological-Update-Feb-2024_UST.pdf" target="_blank">committed some €144 billion</a>&nbsp;in military and financial aid to Ukraine, but have allocated for delivery only about €77 billion of that, according to Germany&#8217;s Kiel Institute, which compiles national contributions to Kyiv’s war effort. The U.S. has committed about €68 billion in total aid and has allocated for delivery about&nbsp;€66 billion, according to the Kiel data. However, the U.S. leads Europe slightly when it comes specifically to military aid.</p>



<p>The U.S. House is expected to move toward a vote this weekend on some $60 billion in aid for Ukraine that’s been held up for months by partisan debate in the Congress.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Individuals hit by these sanctions are subject to an asset freeze and EU travel ban.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Council of the European Union on Friday announced sanctions on four “extremist” settlers and two groups over serious human rights abuses against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem.</p>



<p>“The listed individuals and entities are responsible for serious human rights abuses against Palestinians, including torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and for the violation of right to property and to private and family life of Palestinians in the West Bank,” <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/04/19/extremist-settlers-in-the-occupied-west-bank-and-east-jerusalem-council-sanctions-four-individuals-and-two-entities-over-serious-human-rights-abuses-against-palestinians/" target="_blank">said</a> the Council of the EU in a statement.</p>



<p>The listed entities are Lehava, a far-right Jewish supremacist group; and Hilltop Youth, a “radical youth group consisting of members known for violent acts against Palestinians and their villages in the West Bank,” according to the statement.</p>



<p>The four individuals hit by the sanctions are Meir Ettinger and Elisha Yered — both leading figures of Hilltop Youth — as well as Neria Ben Pazi and Yinon Levi.</p>



<p>It is the first time the European Union has imposed sanctions on radical Israeli settlers in the West Bank over acts of violence against Palestinians, the German press agency DPA <a href="https://twitter.com/dpa_intl/status/1781273272916537819" target="_blank">wrote</a>, citing diplomats.</p>



<p>In addition to a travel ban to the EU, the individuals listed under the sanctions regime are subject to having their assets frozen, along with being prohibited from provision of funds or economic resources — “directly or indirectly, to them or for their benefit.”</p>



<p>On Wednesday, the EU had said it was “gravely concerned about the worsening situation in the occupied West Bank where settler violence, intimidation, and destruction of homes and property have continued to steeply rise over the past few days.”</p>



<p>“We condemn all attacks against civilians, including the reported killings of four Palestinians and call on Israel to step up efforts to prevent recurrent settler violence against Palestinians and ensure the perpetrators of crimes are held accountable,” <a href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/israelpalestine-statement-spokesperson-increased-settler-violence-and-recent-killings-west-bank_en" target="_blank">said</a> Peter Stano, spokesperson for EU’s Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, in a statement.</p>



<p>In December, EU top diplomat Josep Borrell said he would <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-top-diplomat-josep-borrell-set-propose-sanctions-west-bank-settlers-israel/">propose imposing sanctions</a> on “extremist” Israeli settlers in the West Bank. </p>



<p>“We will work on imposing sanctions against extremist settlers in the West Bank. I will make a proposal to member states in this regard,” Borrell&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-250294" target="_blank">said</a> at a press conference after a meeting of EU foreign ministers.</p>



<p>Borrell added he was “alarmed” by the Israeli government’s approval of the construction of another 1,700 housing units in east Jerusalem to expand the settlements. &#8220;The EU considers the plan illegal under international law,&#8221; he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Russian defense ministry said the bomber crashed as it was returning from a mission in Ukraine “due to technical malfunction."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>KYIV — Ukraine succeeded for the first time in shooting down a Tu–22M3 strategic bomber, used by Russia to bomb Ukraine from a distance, the Ukrainian air force said in <a href="https://t.me/s/kpszsu" target="_blank">a statement</a> Friday.</p>



<p>“The enemy aircraft was shot down at a distance of about 300 kilometers from Ukraine. The damaged bomber was able to fly to the Stavropol region of Russia, where it fell and crashed,” Ukraine&#8217;s military intelligence said in a <a href="https://t.me/DIUkraine/3716" target="_blank">Telegram post</a>.</p>



<p>Previously, Kyiv had only managed to damage bombers at the Russian airfield and not been  able to reach the Tu–22M3. The strategic bomber, which carries Kh-22 cruise missiles, is used to attack Ukrainian cities from a large distance.</p>



<p>Ukraine&#8217;s military intelligence said Ukrainians used the same means to down the bomber as were previously used to shoot down an <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-russia-war-plane-shot-down-a50-il22/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-russia-war-plane-shot-down-a50-il22/">A-50 surveillance plane</a> over the Sea of Azov in January.</p>



<p>The Russian defense ministry <a href="https://t.me/bazabazon/27099" target="_blank">said</a> the bomber crashed as it was returning from a mission in Ukraine “due to technical malfunction.&#8221; Locals in Stavropol <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M99ouqXcbg" target="_blank">posted videos</a> of a burning plane falling.</p>



<p>The bomber mission was part of a larger Russian air attack which killed eight and injured 25 in the Dnipro region, in the east of Ukraine, in the early hours of Friday, local authorities said.</p>



<p>Ukraine&#8217;s air force reported shooting down all 14 drones and 15 out of 22 missiles Russia launched in Friday&#8217;s attack.</p>



<p>In the city of Dnipro, the Russian attack damaged five high-rise buildings, two private houses, three educational institutions, seven administrative and office buildings, a market, shops, trade pavilions and a hotel, Dnipro Regional Military Administration <a href="https://t.me/s/adm_dp" target="_blank">reported</a>. In the Synelnykove district of the Dnipro region, the attack damaged more than 60 private homes and destroyed a solar power station, the administration added.</p>



<p>“Every state that provides air-defense systems to Ukraine, every leader who helps convince partners that air defense should now not be in warehouses, but in real cities and communities that are under attack by terrorists, everyone who supports our defense is a lifesaver,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy <a href="https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/10126?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR2QsoSFIz-NKVRgmPWbmbXSgv8mZ3bf4PEYUF4wIYiwQdBQFt4nnug7Kfw_aem_AZvXT7MAbLLix4ZikNyEdd8cVX03bDrfwyD4sg87c85Uik8JaOfDv7ULWvKn2qxIkHISQf3RAcrNNBCT7mF_xqKy" target="_blank">said</a> following the strikes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[“This strike is clearly intended to not escalate the situation further,” one former Pentagon official said.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Israel launched a strike on Iran early Friday in what appeared to be a limited response to Tehran’s drone and missile assault last weekend, according to a U.S. official and a person familiar with the discussions.</p>



<p>The retaliatory strike was designed to be “limited” in scope in order to avoid a wider regional war, said the person familiar. The people were granted anonymity to discuss sensitive internal deliberations.</p>



<p>Both Iran and Israel seemed to want to prevent escalation in the hours after the strike. Israel has not claimed responsibility or commented, while Iranian officials have played down the attack. Iranian media reported that sites associated with Iran’s nuclear program had not been damaged.</p>



<p>The National Security Council declined to comment.</p>



<p>Iranian officials said the country’s&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-mideast-tensions-4-19-2024-a7ccbae2e2844bab089e8e4377a24ddb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">air defense systems</a>&nbsp;in the cities of Isfahan and Tabriz shot down a “suspicious object” that did not cause any damage, state media reported overnight. The comments came after explosions were heard close to a military airbase near Isfahan, home to Iran’s fleet of F-14 Tomcat fighter jets. The city is also home to facilities associated with Iran’s nuclear program.</p>



<p>Iran did not identify the source of the strike.</p>



<p>The Biden administration has also been mum about the attack. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, when asked about the strike, said the U.S. was not involved in any “offensive operations.”</p>



<p>Italy’s foreign minister Antonio Tajani said the U.S. was “informed at the last minute” about the attack. Tajani and Blinken made their remarks while attending a G7 meeting in Capri, Italy.</p>



<p>But the situation is still precarious. The strike came hours after Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/18/middleeast/iran-foreign-minister-israel-warning-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iran’s response would be ‘immediate”</a>&nbsp;if Israel takes any military action against Iran.</p>



<p>“You see everyone contorting themselves on both sides to do something that’s palatable politically, but still meets the overarching aim” of not starting a regional war, the person familiar said.</p>



<p>Experts said the public messaging — and lack thereof — allows both sides to keep the crisis from spinning out of control.</p>



<p>“This strike is clearly intended to not escalate the situation further,” wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/dstroul/status/1781272093050409280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dana Stroul,</a>&nbsp;who until December served as the Pentagon’s chief of Middle East policy, on social media. “If everyone decides that further rounds of state on state attacks are not in their interest, this chapter can [close]…for now.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Iran has played down the attack and said it has no plans to retaliate.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Western leaders have called for de-escalation following an attack reportedly carried out by Israel on Iranian territory early Friday, amid growing fears of a widening conflict in the Middle East.</p>



<p>“We have to do everything possible [so] that all sides restrain from the escalation in that region,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen <a href="https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-255975" target="_blank">told</a> reporters during a visit to Finland on Friday. “It is absolutely necessary that the region stays stable and that all sides refrain from further action,” she said.</p>



<p>“We are working on de-escalation,” United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken <a href="https://www.rainews.it/maratona/2024/04/veto-usa-sullingresso-della-palestina-allonu-lanp-ci-spingete-sullorlo-dellabisso-2ce3cfa0-ae04-4e27-826b-6c19b1e79dda.html" target="_blank">said</a> at the end of a meeting of G7 foreign affairs ministers Friday on the Italian island of Capri. “We are not involved in any offensive operation,” he continued. </p>



<p>“The G7 is committed to Israel’s security and achieving de-escalation,” Blinken added. </p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/18/world/israel-iran-gaza-war-news" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/19/israel-iran-hamas-war-news-gaza-palestine/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/19/israel-iran-hamas-war-news-gaza-palestine/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> and other media cited Israeli officials confirming the strike was carried out by the Israeli military. Iran <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/iran-air-defense-shoot-attack-near-isfahan/">fired</a> air-defense batteries early Friday after reports of explosions near a major airbase at the city of Isfahan, the state-run IRNA news agency reported.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-leaders-condemn-irans-revenge-attack-on-israel/">Tehran bombarded Israel</a> last Saturday night with around 300 missiles and drones, most of which were fended off by Israel and its allies, governments around the world <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/friendly-arab-nations-urge-restraint-but-will-netanyahu-listen/">held their breath</a> to see whether Israel would retaliate.</p>



<p>The bombardment followed Israel’s <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/iran-president-ebrahim-raisi-vows-revenge-israel-after-attack-embassy-damascus/">bombing of an Iranian consulate</a> in Damascus, Syria, at the start of April.</p>



<p>Iran <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-missiles-hit-site-iran-abc-news-reports-2024-04-19/" target="_blank">has played down</a> Friday’s attack, and said it had no plans to retaliate again.</p>



<p>“It’s a developing situation; it wouldn&#8217;t be right for me to speculate until the facts become clearer,” British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/prime-minister-david-cameron-tehran-israeli-iran-b2531384.html" target="_blank">said</a>. “We’re working to confirm the details together with allies,” he continued.</p>



<p>“Significant escalation is not in anyone’s interest. What we want to see is calm heads prevail across the region,” Sunak added.</p>



<p>“We call on everyone to continue to contribute to de-escalation in the future. De-escalation remains the order of the day,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz <a href="https://twitter.com/Bundeskanzler/status/1781276787944685695" target="_blank">wrote on X</a> (formerly Twitter). “We will talk about this with all our friends and allies and work together with them in this direction.”</p>



<p>Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot called recent developments in the Middle East “deeply worrying” in <a href="https://twitter.com/HankeBruinsSlot/status/1781213749560353057" target="_blank">a post</a> on X. “It is of paramount importance that further escalation is prevented,” she said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Former prime minister failed to disclose links to hedge fund which organized a visit to Venezuela.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LONDON — Boris Johnson failed to answer questions about his relationship with a hedge fund that helped organize a trip to meet Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Britain&#8217;s revolving door watchdog declared Friday.</p>



<p>The former prime minister was branded &#8220;evasive&#8221; and in breach of Westminster lobbying rules by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which advises politicians and top officials about post-government jobs.</p>



<p>It said Johnson did not declare a prior relationship with hedge fund Merlyn Advisors, whose co-founder Maarten Petermann also attended the February meeting in Venezuela.</p>



<p>&#8220;Given the evasive nature of your replies, your failure to answer specific questions put to you, or provide the context of your relationship with Merlyn Advisors, the committee has formed the view that there has been a breach of the government’s business appointment rules,&#8221; Acoba Chair Eric Pickles wrote in a letter to Johnson published Friday.</p>



<p>Johnson previously sought advice from the watchdog over work with Merlyn Advisors as an independent contractor back in September 2023.  But that application was withdrawn after Johnson said he would not take up the work.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-visit-venezuela-president-nicolas-maduro-ukraine-russia-war-mt23g5pzk" target="_blank">The Sunday Times reported</a> that Johnson&#8217;s February trip saw him speak to Maduro about the war in Ukraine and discuss conditions for normalizing relations with the U.K., which does not accept the legitimacy of Maduro&#8217;s administration.</p>



<p>In his letter to Johnson, Acoba Chair Eric Pickles said there was a &#8220;reasonable concern that you were acting for Merlyn Advisors in a capacity that would be considered advisory — which Acoba would expect an application for.&#8221;</p>



<p>Acoba rules say former ministers must not announce or take up any new appointments until the committee has provided advice. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Rules &#8216;unenforceable&#8217;</h3>



<p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66214c26be5f81890e757d4a/_2024-04-19_Reporting_breach_to_HMG-_Mr_Johnson-Merlyn__1_.pdf" target="_blank">In a separate letter to Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden</a> — whose department must decide whether to take any action against Johnson — Pickles said  Johnson has been &#8220;evasive&#8221; with the watchdog, avoided answering specific questions and &#8220;refused to be open&#8221; about the relationship.</p>



<p>Pickles, who has been pushing for a shake-up of Acoba rules long branded toothless, said the current set-up depends on the cooperation of applicants and departments, and warned the rules &#8220;no longer have relevance in the modern world and are unenforceable to applicants determined to ignore them.&#8221;</p>



<p>Johnson&#8217;s spokesperson declined to comment. The Cabinet Office did not respond to a request for comment. </p>

					<description><![CDATA["Do not try to repeat it,” Lithuanian president warned perpetrators. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Polish authorities have detained two people suspected of violently attacking Leonid Volkov, an exiled ally of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. </p>



<p>“Navalny aide Leonid Volkov was brutally attacked in Vilnius. Today, I am glad to announce that suspects have been detained in Poland,&#8221; Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda <a href="https://twitter.com/GitanasNauseda/status/1781234821240406026" target="_blank">announced</a> Friday. </p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you to Andrzej Duda, Polish and Lithuanian law enforcement. Together we warn the organizers of the crime: do not try to repeat it,” Nausėda added.</p>



<p>Volkov <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/navalnys-former-policy-chief-brutally-attacked-in-vilnius-says-team/">was beaten</a> outside his home in Vilnius in March, with his colleagues saying he had tear gas sprayed in his eyes and was beaten with a hammer. </p>



<p>“They broke the window in his car and sprayed tear gas in his eyes, after which the attacker began to beat Leonid with a hammer,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Kira_Yarmysh/status/1767646012007387584?s=20" target="_blank">wrote</a> Kira Yarmysh, another member of the Navalny team. Navalny, a longtime thorn in Russian President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s flesh, died at age 47 in an Arctic prison in February. </p>



<p>On Friday morning, Volkov <a href="https://t.me/leonid_volkov/4565" target="_blank">said</a>: “I don’t know any other details yet, but I can say: I have seen how energetically and persistently the Lithuanian police have worked over the past month on this case, and I am very glad that this work has been effective.”</p>



<p>Lithuania’s counter-intelligence had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/attack-navalny-aide-was-work-russian-special-services-says-lithuania-counter-2024-03-14/" target="_blank">accused</a> Russian special services of being behind the attack.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Former prime minister gets rap on the knuckles for sharing private chats.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LONDON — Liz Truss wasn&#8217;t known for playing by the rules during her short-lived premiership.</p>



<p>The Conservative former prime minister has spent the week plugging her new <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/liz-truss-trump-brexit-fleas-book-united-kingdom/">book</a> about her time in government.</p>



<p>Now the U.K. government has waded in, declaring Truss broke its rules by failing to get approval to include private conversations with the late Queen Elizabeth II in her memoir.</p>



<p>While Truss submitted her book to civil servants in the Cabinet Office for review, a final sign-off was not sought before publication.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/queen-elizabeth-advice-liz-truss-ten-years-to-save-the-west-book/">Truss wrote that Queen Elizabeth II</a> told her to &#8220;pace yourself&#8221; in a meeting with the monarch.  She said the queen told her being PM is &#8220;incredibly aging&#8221; during their 20 minute conversation, which became the monarch&#8217;s last official engagement before her death days later.</p>



<p>But a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “This book was submitted to the Cabinet Office for review.</p>



<p>“While we would not publicize the details of any discussions, we did not agree to the final wording. So the author is in breach of the Radcliffe Rules.”</p>



<p>The Radcliffe Rules prohibit the publication of content which is damaging or destructive to national security, the U.K.&#8217;s international relations or confidential government business. </p>



<p>Truss&#8217; team did not respond to POLITICO&#8217;s request for an on-the-record comment.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/liz-trusss-book-ten-years-to-save-the-west-in-breach-of-rules-in-place-on-ministers-memoirs-13118151" target="_blank">Sky News cited a</a> &#8220;source close to&#8221; the former prime minister saying: &#8220;The Cabinet Office confirmed that Liz complied with all the rules regarding national security and relations with foreign governments, but she wanted to ensure that the truth was told about the mini-budget and the role of officials and the Bank of England. </p>



<p>&#8220;She believes this is in the public interest.&#8221;</p>



<p>Truss resigned after seven weeks in office following a mini-budget which precipitated market turmoil. <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/liz-truss-deep-state-get-donald-trump/">In the book</a>, she claims the U.K.’s Treasury, the Bank of England and its Office for Budget Responsibility&nbsp;engaged in a “sustained whispering campaign” against her tax-cutting policies.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Congress is inching toward approving military aid for Kyiv and the Republican principal has some thoughts. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Europe needs to do more itself to support Ukraine, Donald Trump warned on Thursday night as the U.S. Congress edges closer to approving new military aid for Kyiv. </p>



<p>The U.S. Republican Party standard bearer, a prominent NATO skeptic who could return to the White House after November’s election, complained: “<a href="https://twitter.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1781031895553445977" data-type="link" data-id="https://twitter.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1781031895553445977" target="_blank">Why isn’t Europe giving more</a> money to help Ukraine? Why is it that the United States is over $100 Billion &#8230; into the Ukraine War more than Europe, and we have an Ocean between us as separation!”</p>



<p>Trump for years has accused European NATO allies of freeloading on America to provide protection against hostile foreign powers and urged them to spend more on defense. The issue has become especially acute for European security officials given Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s increasing belligerence and revanchist rhetoric. </p>



<p>In raw numbers, the United States dwarfs the amount of military aid sent by any European country. </p>



<p>“Why can’t Europe equalize or match the money put in by the United States of America in order to help a Country in desperate need?” Trump railed on his Truth Social platform. “As everyone agrees, Ukrainian Survival and Strength should be much more important to Europe than to us, but it is also important to us! GET MOVING EUROPE!”</p>



<p>The former president’s remarks come as Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is expected to submit a bill for a vote on some $60 billion in aid for Ukraine that’s been snarled up for months by hard-line members of his party.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/why-ukraine-losing-russia-war/">Ukraine is struggling</a> to resist Putin’s full-scale invasion, more than two years after it began and faces a make-or-break moment. Ukrainian forces are running short of critical weapons and ammunition as President <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/volodymyr-zelenskyy-calls-more-western-air-defense-russias-missile-strike-kills-northern-ukraine/">Volodymyr Zelenskyy urges the West</a> to step up its support. </p>



<p>Johnson is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/18/biden-johnson-ukraine-aid-00153237" target="_blank">embracing</a> $60.8 billion in assistance to Ukraine in a push to prevent deep losses on the battlefield, amid warnings that Ukrainians are losing faith in the U.S. following months of delay.</p>



<p>In familiar rhetoric, Trump concluded: “If I were President, this War would have never started.”</p>
