As a junior member of the House, Gingrich pioneered the style of confrontational conservatism and bare-knuckle partisan brawling that today’s Republican hard-liners — led by Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz — have seemingly made their signature. </p><p>But times have changed, Gingrich said this week when I called him to ask whether he had any advice for Johnson. With a conservative like Johnson in the speaker’s chair, Gingrich told me, it’s time for Republicans to shut up and fall in line. “The truth is, I would blame head-on the people who are acting like selfish idiots,” Gingrich said, name-checking Gaetz. </p><p>Having faced down his own <a href="https://rollcall.com/2005/04/22/1997-gop-seeks-but-fails-to-oust-gingrich/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Republican-led coup attempt&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://rollcall.com/2005/04/22/1997-gop-seeks-but-fails-to-oust-gingrich/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d3e0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d3e0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Republican-led coup attempt</a> in 1997, Gingrich urged Johnson to hold his ground and pass the foreign aid packages — even if it ultimately costs him the speakership. </p><p>“Brave men die but once,” he said. “A coward dies a hundred deaths.” </p><p><i>The following has been edited for clarity and concision.</i> </p><p><b>You </b><a href="https://twitter.com/newtgingrich/status/1780288915229864217" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;b>tweeted the other day&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/newtgingrich/status/1780288915229864217&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d3e0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d3e0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>tweeted the other day</b></a><b> that Speaker Johnson is “working to lead the most complicated House since the Civil War.” That’s a pretty bold claim. What makes his job uniquely hard?</b></p><p>Well, he has the narrowest majority in modern times, and it’s not a true majority, because he’s got six or eight narcissists — people who think that they individually get to screw up everything. </p><p><b>Do you want to name any names?</b></p><p>I think they self-define. I’d start with [Matt] Gaetz, but I would say the list goes on. He’s the super narcissist. </p><p>So first of all, he doesn’t have a real majority. He has a technical majority for the purpose of organizing committees and theoretically controlling the flow of legislation, but he doesn’t have a working majority on the Rules Committee. He doesn’t have an ability to deliver 218 votes for virtually anything. He has 30 or 40 members who ideologically wake up every morning knowing that they’re gonna vote no — they’re not sure what the issue is, but they know they’re going to vote no. And then he’s got this last 30 or 40 [members] who need to do something to go on TV and send out fundraising emails, and they don’t frankly care if they screw up our party or the country, if that’s what it takes for them to be so important. So he has an enormously complicated job.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6339472183112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><b>How would you rate his handling of the situation?</b> </p><p>I think, actually, he’s doing a pretty decent job considering how almost impossible it is. </p><p>He’s patient, he’s calm, he is trying to understand whether or not there are paths that might work, and trying to come up with formulas that enable him to get something out of the House. Frankly, the danger for the hard right is that if they teach 120 or 130 members that the only way to get anything done is to work with the Democrats, they’ll end up with much worse legislation than they would get if they would actually work as a team. So it’s a real challenge, I think, and I’m watching what he’s doing and I have great sympathy for how hard his job is.<b>&#xa0;</b></p><p><b>But back in the ’70s, you </b><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/newt/newt78speech.html#:~:text=And%20I%20think%20that%20one,but%20are%20lousy%20in%20politics." target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;b>famously said&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/newt/newt78speech.html#:~:text=And%20I%20think%20that%20one,but%20are%20lousy%20in%20politics.&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d3e0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d3e0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>famously said</b></a><b>, “One of the great problems we have in the Republican Party is that we don’t encourage people to be nasty.” Do you think Johnson is nasty enough to be speaker?</b> </p><p>I think you have to take situations in their historical context. In the 1970s, we had a Republican Party that was in the minority — and would remain in the minority for a total of 40 years — that was unable to go to the floor to debate and that was able to stand up to the left. You needed people who were tough and who were willing to take on Tip O’Neill or Jim Wright or the entire left wing of the Democratic Party. In that sense, Trump is sort of a prototype of that kind of approach. He’s tough enough to stand and fight, not just limply hide in the corner. </p><p>The challenge you have once you have the majority is that you want to be positive and get something done — and the country expects you to get something done. So that’s why I think this is a real challenge. The demons that Gaetz unleashed by going after [Kevin] McCarthy are still out there. You can’t govern by shooting yourself in the head every day. </p><p><b>So it’s fair to say you think it would be a mistake if members moved forward with the motion to vacate?</b> </p><p>It would be totally stupid. My question would be, “Show me the 218 you’ve got for somebody,” because otherwise what you’re doing is putting us through three weeks of looking like idiots — which Gaetz managed to do. It was bad enough that it took 15 ballots for McCarthy to finally win. But to then turn and destroy his speakership, throwing the entire party and the entire House into [chaos] … </p><p>You’ve got to remember, this isn’t some game at a PTA meeting. This is the House of Representatives. It has serious constitutional obligations. We live in a dangerous world, and we look like we are absurdly incapable of governing ourselves. </p><p><b>It seems clear at this point that if Johnson passes Ukraine aid with Democratic support, he’ll face some sort of motion to vacate. What do you think he should prioritize: passing Ukraine aid or keeping his speakership?</b> </p><p>Brave men die but once, a coward dies a hundred deaths. </p><p><b>So pass Ukraine aid?</b> </p><p>Do what you think is historically right, and then if your party is dumb enough to punish them for doing what you honestly believe, then you shouldn’t be there anyway.<b>&#xa0;</b></p><p><b>You don’t give any credence to the conservatives’ arguments that the U.S. has already given too much to Ukraine?</b> </p><p>I believe we have to defeat [Vladimir] Putin, period, whatever it takes. If Putin wins in Ukraine, the next stage will be Putin in the three Baltic States and Poland, and then we will be faced with a genuine world war.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/d3/3d/6e42c9164cee930c7161c3eddf1b/u-s-congress-52634.jpg" /><br /><p><b>That sounds like it would be bad.&#xa0;</b></p><p>The biggest change I would make is to let Ukrainians do combat in Russia. It’s a typical Biden-ism that Russians get to destroy your infrastructure, the Russians get to kidnap children, the Russians get to gang rape women, the Russians get to destroy hospitals, but Ukraine <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-ukraine-oil-refineries-strikes-biden-administration-vladimir-putin-b0ef679c" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;shouldn’t attack&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-ukraine-oil-refineries-strikes-biden-administration-vladimir-putin-b0ef679c&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d3f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d3f0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">shouldn’t attack</a> inside Russia. That’s totally stupid. </p><p><b>Can Johnson survive in the long run if Democrats have to step in and save him from a motion to vacate?</b> </p><p>He is speaker of the House.</p><p><b>Sure, but can he survive if Democrats decide to step in to defeat a motion to vacate?</b> </p><p>It depends on how many Republicans that would alienate. </p><p><b>How many do you think it would alienate?</b> </p><p>Thirty or 40. </p><p><b>Which would be enough to oust him, right?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Not if there are 40 or 50 Democrats.<b>&#xa0;</b></p><p><b>That’s true.</b> </p><p>What are you going to do? Are we going to run around every day, stick your finger up in the air and see whether or not Matt Gaetz blows on it? </p><p><b>Do you ever look at the House and think, “If I was speaker, I could get these knuckleheads in line?”</b> </p><p>You can’t keep them in line, because the technology’s changed. They have the ability to make noise, they have the ability to go on television, and they have an ability to use the internet to raise money from [people] who only know who they are because they saw them on television, so what do they care? </p><p><b>How would you handle them if you were in the speaker’s chair?</b> </p><p>I would do what is right and tell them it’s their problem. Do you want someone who is going to be a coward and who’s going to spend every day making sure that all 218 or 219 members are happy? Then you need to get somebody else. If they want a leader, I’ll be glad to lead. </p><p>That is what I said — several times. We once had a rebellion, and at the end of the rebellion I had a meeting and I said, “I will stay as speaker only if I’m speaker.”<b>&#xa0;</b></p><p><b>Sorry — you’d stay only as long as you were speaker?</b> </p><p>There was a brief moment when several members of the leadership decided they didn’t like me and they tried to oust me, and I said, “I want all of you to understand: I’m only going to stay if I remain the speaker.”<br /></p><br /><p><b>So do you think Mike Johnson should resign if he loses the speakership?</b> </p><p>Why would he resign?<b>&#xa0;</b></p><p><b>You just said you told [leadership] that you’d only stay if you were the speaker. So I’m wondering if you would give him the same advice.</b> </p><p>Johnson should say to his conference, “I’m going to listen to everybody, make my best possible judgment and then we’re going to move — and if that’s not the kind of speaker you want, you need somebody else.” But I’d like to [know what the hard-liners’ desired] characteristics are. Do you want somebody who <i>can’t</i> make a decision? Does anybody realistically believe that there’s any plausible strategy at 218 or 220 that is going to have enough Republicans stick together? So you’re inevitably going to be in a coalition government. You can’t pass anything of significance if you start out every morning with six or eight people wanting to destroy you when the margin is two. </p><p>The truth is, I would blame head-on the people who are acting like selfish idiots. I would just say, “You’re the people giving the Democrats working control — and as long as you think that’s a great success, well, you must be doing the right thing.”<b>&#xa0;</b></p><p><b>Why do you think Johnson hasn’t said that yet?</b> </p><p>I think that he is a much more disciplined and patient man than I am. Remember, I had 16 years trying to create a majority. We had built a team, and we were operating as a team. He had 15 minutes. I, frankly, admire the speed at which he’s learning. </p><p><b>Have you been in touch with him to offer any counsel?</b> </p><p>Oh, I don’t offer counsel. I might offer ideas.</p><p><b>Have you offered ideas then?</b> </p><p>I talk with his team regularly.<b>&#xa0;</b><br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351047360112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><b>Do you think the legislative challenges you mentioned above are reflective of something deeper that’s gone wrong with the GOP?</b> </p><p>We have an interesting challenge, in that [Nancy] Pelosi was the leader of a party that believes in machines. So they legitimized Pelosi punishing [them], because they’re a machine — they are essentially the <i>Sopranos</i>-go-to-the-election. </p><p>We are a party of individuals. I was once talking to Kurt Russell, and I asked him why is it so hard to get conservatives to get together in Hollywood, when liberals love to get together? He said, “Well, conservatives are the people who don’t want to go to meetings.” So the party is genuinely individualistic, and at its best it produces remarkable talent and remarkable leaders. But it means that you have to lead by persuasion — you can’t lead by punishment. I’d rather have Mike Johnson calmly, patiently trying to listen to and understand his team, rather than have a thug-like dictator in the Pelosi tradition. </p><p><b>You came to power in part through your willingness to punch up at Republican leadership and </b><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/newt-gingrich-says-youre-welcome/570832/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;b>break some procedural and political norms&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/newt-gingrich-says-youre-welcome/570832/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d3f0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d3f0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>break some procedural and political norms</b></a><b>. You don’t find anything sympathetic about these figures on the right who are using some of the same tactics that you helped pioneer?</b></p><p>I don’t think that’s an accurate history. The only major fight where you’ll find that I was going against my leadership was when George H.W. Bush broke his word and raised taxes. I at times disagreed with my leadership, and I at times offered amendments or helped other people offer amendments, but I consistently was part of the team. I woke up every day thinking I was a Republican. My effort was to strengthen the party, recruit more candidates and deal with issues. We didn’t focus on trying to beat other Republicans. We focused on trying to beat Democrats. </p><p><b>So that’s the major difference between today’s conservatives and you? That you were playing on a team and they’re not?</b> </p><p>During the 16 years where we worked to create a majority, a substantial amount of our senior leadership was happy to be calmly, quietly cutting deals, and we were fighting the Democrats and making it harder. But there was no point where we would have split the party. I always tell people: You can get away with almost anything if you tell the leadership in advance, but you can’t surprise the leadership. So my relationship with [former House Minority Leader] Bob Michel was tense at times, because he wasn’t always happy with me. But he always knew where I was coming from, and he knew what I was trying to do, and he knew that when push came to shove, I was a party loyalist. Some of these guys are basically ego-loyalists.<b>&#xa0;</b></p><p><b>What would your message be to the hard-liners who are threatening to tank these bills and oust Johnson?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Decide if your love of country isn’t greater than your love of self.<br /></p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

Joe Biden says Trump was the first president to preside over a net loss in jobs since Herbert Hoover.</p><p>Biden boasts that his own presidency is defined by booming job growth and plunging deficits. Trump says consumers haven’t felt worse in decades, because of inflation.</p><p>The weird thing is, they’re both right — about everything.</p><p>Voters have the unusual opportunity to choose between two candidates that have already worked in the Oval Office. But the pandemic irreparably garbled data that could act as a point of comparison. Under Trump, the economy added roughly 7 million new jobs, but then shutdowns and panic from Covid pushed more than 22 million people out of work in March and April of 2020 alone. He ultimately ended his term with a net loss of 3 million jobs.</p><p>On the flip side, Biden smashed records by adding 6.6 million jobs in his first year in office, but that represented healing; the U.S. economy didn’t recover all the jobs lost during Covid until 2022.</p><p>In other words: “Covid is weird, and it makes comparisons weird,” said Martha Gimbel, who worked at the White House as an economic adviser to Biden until last year.</p><p>This might seem like a convenient argument for Biden allies, given that voters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/14/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;overwhelmingly prefer Trump’s economy&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/04/14/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d460000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d460001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">overwhelmingly prefer Trump’s economy</a> to Biden’s. And I mostly hear people in the administration focus instead on the ways that they’ve tried to make the economy better, such as investing in infrastructure.</p><p>But the pandemic hangs over any debate about the merits of “Bidenomics.”<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6348436122112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>After all, the answer to the classic question — are you better off today than you were four years ago? — is: Well, four years ago the entire country was engulfed in a mass trauma.</p><p>It’s not just the big-picture stats. Covid and its aftermath has also continued to affect economic outcomes in ways that are impossible to cleanly separate from the policy response.</p><p>Ironically, when trashing the current economy, Trump ignores the fact that his administration deserves some credit for its current health (the overwhelmingly bipartisan CARES Act, negotiated by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and passed in March 2020, was crucial to helping the country bridge the chaos).</p><p>But Trump would also never admit that the job market was in rare form during his presidency in part because it fell at the tail end of the longest expansion in U.S. history. The economy slowly but surely healed in the decade following the Great Recession and unemployment creeped down, reaching 50-year lows of 3.6 percent by 2019, allowing wage growth to comfortably exceed inflation.</p><p>Basically, this election is between two men who have both presided over good economies but also bookended a once-in-a-century pandemic.</p><p>“On President Trump’s last day in office, GDP was growing at 6.3 percent,” Trump’s campaign trumpeted the night that Biden gave his State of the Union address.</p><p>That number captures a brief moment in time when the economy was coming out of the Covid nosedive. It’s perfectly true (except it was later revised down to 5.2 percent), but it’s also pretty useless for the purposes of assessing Trump’s presidency.</p><p>That same night, Biden touted the creation of 15 million new jobs during his first three years in office, an absurdly large number that reflects just how many jobs were briefly lost in the middle of 2020.</p><p>And yet, the recovery also allowed the labor force to emerge remarkably unscathed from an unemployment rate that briefly approached 15 percent in 2020, which is surely a credit to the force of the government’s response. The speed of the bounceback, and further improvement, was not at all guaranteed to the degree we’ve seen.</p><p>Joblessness has been below 4 percent for two years, which hasn’t happened since the 1960s. Inflation-adjusted wages are on the rise again after getting hammered by price spikes.</p><p>Inflation, of course, is the particular conundrum faced by the Biden campaign: Does it represent the excesses of spending under Democratic leadership, or is it merely another strange Covid aftershock? Each party has chosen its own reductive narrative, but inflation was certainly caused by pandemic-era disruptions that massively slowed output, and supply chains were also put under greater strain because people and businesses had money to buy more stuff.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/21/5a/274d415f48edbbb1fafd5989d2ef/election-2024-trump-85025.jpg" /><br /><p>It’s worth pointing out that Republicans also risked inflation under Trump by passing sweeping tax cuts when unemployment was already low, but that stimulus ended up working out fine, suggesting that — even a decade after the 2008 financial crisis — the economy still wasn’t meeting its full growth potential.</p><p>The continued merit of those tax cuts is especially important heading into next year, when they expire, and the next president will have to decide which parts of the law to extend.</p><p>And the decision for voters, at least as it relates to the economy, should really be about what kind of economic policy that they want next to tackle looming challenges: a housing crisis, geographic disparities in economic outcomes, lack of affordable child care that holds people back from fully participating in the workforce, rising interest payments on the federal debt, and the like.</p><p>Let’s talk less about misleading statistics, and more about that.</p><p>“It’s great we had a couple of good years at the end of the 2010s, and it’s good we’re having that experience right now, but it would be great to see it on a sustained basis,” said Karen Dynan, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School who served as chief economist at the Treasury Department under Barack Obama. “And I just feel like there’s more work to be done fixing structural problems in our economy.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

He has made clear to advisers that he would like a more robust effort to be able to challenge election results as needed.</p><p>It’s also a sign that, should Trump once again attempt to overturn the election, he will already have in place tens of thousands of workers who could help with that effort.</p><p>In a statement, Trump said, “Having the right people to count the ballots is just as important as turning out voters on Election Day.”</p><p>According to the announcement, the Trump operation plans to deploy lawyers to monitor voter machine testing, early voting, election day voting, mail ballot processing and post-election canvassing, auditing and recounts. The campaign also plans to station lawyers at mail-in voting processing centers and set up a hotline that poll watchers and voters can use to report problems.</p><p>The RNC also stated that attorneys will be stationed at “every single target processing center where mail ballots are tabulated.”</p><p>Most states have <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/electioneering-prohibitions" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;rules regulating activities&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/electioneering-prohibitions&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d4a0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d4a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">rules regulating activities</a> at polling sites.

We will aggressively take them to court if they don’t follow rules or try to change them at the last minute.”</p><p>After the November 2020 election, Trump pressured government workers to overturn the election results and regularly spread false claims about voter fraud. On Jan. 6, a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the election.

It now looks like that may be the most effective tool he has going.</p><p>During the first quarter of the year, developments in his various legal cases drew far more small-dollar donations to Trump than normal political developments, including his locking up the GOP nomination this spring, according to a new POLITICO analysis.</p><p>The new data, based on campaign finance filings from WinRed, the payment processor used by Trump and most other Republicans, comes as Trump faces perhaps his biggest legal challenge yet: a criminal trial in New York City on charges that he schemed to falsify records around payments to porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016.</p><p>But for his fundraising purposes, the trial may be a boon. Trump’s best fundraising days this year have been driven by his legal jeopardy, which his joint fundraising committee has worked to monetize. His appeals to supporters often reference his legal woes, and alleged persecution: Of more than 150 fundraising emails sent by his affiliated committees in the past month, nearly one-third included the phrase “witch hunt,” according to a POLITICO analysis.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351242179112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>The messaging appears to be particularly effective when the former president faces new legal threats: Trump had his best online fundraising day of the first quarter — and his third best overall since he launched his presidential campaign — on March 22, when New York Attorney General Tish James, a Democrat, took initial steps toward seizing his assets in the event he failed to make bond in a civil fraud case.<br /></p><br /><p>“What most campaigns have to do is create their own news, and get people to care about their campaign when it’s not in the news,” said Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist. “Trump is going to benefit from wall-to-wall coverage on all the cable networks and live tweets from the courtroom about what’s going on during the trial.”</p><p>Trump is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/15/trump-fundraising-picks-up-with-help-from-big-donors-00152418" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;confronting a massive cash disadvantage against President Joe Biden&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/15/trump-fundraising-picks-up-with-help-from-big-donors-00152418&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d500000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d500001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">confronting a massive cash disadvantage against President Joe Biden</a>, with even Trump advisers conceding they will have less money than the Democratic president. But Trump’s overall fundraising has picked up in recent months, with his joint fundraising committee reporting raising $65 million in the first quarter of the year.</p><p>A Trump ally and top donor closely involved with his campaign’s fundraising efforts, granted anonymity to speak freely, described recent small-dollar donations as “through the roof,” and said the campaign’s “next filing will show a significant bump in those low-dollar contributions, the volume and the unique new donors.”</p><p>Trump’s campaign believes the combination of constant coverage of Trump’s trial and their decision to release near real-time fundraising appeals throughout it could prove to be effective.</p><p>“It's a little bit of a soap opera,” the donor said. “They get results, because they message the play by play. ‘I'm in the courtroom. I'm out of the courtroom. The judge is not going to let me go to Barron's graduation. He’s leaving Trump Tower. He’s out on the FDR.’</p><p>“The more all of that is on the TV, the higher his polls go, the more money comes in, the more sympathy and support,” the donor said.<br /></p><br /><p>The numbers suggest that, at least for Trump’s fundraising purposes, that may be right. When James took a step toward seizing Trump’s property if he failed to make bond in the civil matter, his Save America joint fundraising committee raised $2.6 million online that day from nearly 48,000 donors, including roughly 21,500 who were giving to Trump for the first time this cycle, according to a POLITICO analysis. The dollar total was more than five times a typical day for him this quarter.</p><p>The fundraising surge was by design: The group sent several emails that day mentioning James by name.</p><p>“Trump-hating Democrat AG Letitia James is trying to get her hands on the property I worked so hard to build: THIS INCLUDES TRUMP TOWER!” read one email.</p><p>By contrast, when Trump effectively wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination after former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley dropped out of the race, he saw only a small uptick in donations compared to his quarterly average. His fundraising committee did send a handful of emails noting Haley’s exit and the end of the primary.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351245457112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Biden’s campaign is not issuing fundraising appeals related to Trump’s New York trial and has no plans to, according to a Biden campaign official who was granted anonymity to discuss internal strategy. That’s part of the Biden campaign’s overall strategy to generally avoid publicly engaging with Trump’s legal dilemmas.</p><p>Trump’s trial-related fundraising is unlikely to draw him even with Biden in the money race. A Republican fundraiser in Trump’s orbit and granted anonymity to speak freely said that despite the likely grassroots donor boost the trial will give, “We’re so far behind the left on their low-dollar fundraising” that it’s unlikely to have a dramatic impact on Democrats’ small-dollar lead.</p><p>Trump’s political operation has fundraised heavily off his New York court appearances this week as he faces his first criminal trial. Since early April, he has largely sent fundraising emails to benefit a new joint fundraising committee, Trump National Committee, that raises money for both his campaign and the Republican National Committee. Notably, unlike his previous joint committee, it doesn’t raise money for the leadership PAC that has paid millions in legal bills for Trump and his allies. The new group sent roughly a dozen emails to some supporters in the first two days of the trial.</p><p>“I JUST STORMED OUT OF BIDEN’S KANGAROO COURT! What I’ve been FORCED to endure would make any patriotic American SICK,” said one email set Monday afternoon, around the time that Trump left court.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/88/b7/fbe2ed6d4be582809216282db4f2/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2147901047" /><br /><p>In a Tuesday email, Trump touted camouflage-style Make America Great Again hats for donors who gave at least $50 — with the twist that he might “might wear this CAMO MAGA hat while I’m in court next.”</p><p>The campaign appears to still need to work out the timing of some of those texts and emails. On Wednesday, the day each week when the trial will not take place, one of those Trump National Committee fundraising texts went out, declaring he was “on trial AS WE SPEAK” and in “the courtroom today.”</p><p>The New York trial also comes as Trump’s overall fundraising has been on an upward trajectory — an unsurprising trend as the election gets closer. His primary joint fundraising committee, Save America, averaged $596,000 per day on WinRed, the Republican platform in the first three months of 2024, up from $229,000 per day in the final three months of last year.</p><p>Part of that strength is repeat donors who give to Trump regularly. Of the roughly 592,000 donors who gave to his joint fundraising committee on WinRed in the first three months of the year, nearly half gave multiple times in the period. A quarter of donors gave at least once a month.</p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351245457112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><br />There are still some warning signs for Trump, even as his donations have picked up. The total number of unique donors giving to his joint fundraising committee in the first quarter was down 11 percent compared to his affiliates over the same period in the 2020 cycle.</p><p>“As with any fundraising tactic,” noted Wilson, who also runs the Center for Campaign Innovation, a nonprofit helping conservatives with digital strategy, “you start to get diminishing returns as people are tapped out.”</p><p>As the digital director for Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential campaign, however, Wilson became well acquainted with the reality that Trump’s ability to generate free media far surpasses anyone else’s. And with that being the case, Trump may be able for now to ride the wave of donations fueled by trial coverage.</p><p>“The amount he raises is going to be proportionate to the amount of attention he gets in a given day,” Wilson said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

On Thursday, CIA Director William Burns warned that, barring more U.S. aid, Ukraine "could lose on the battlefield by the end of 2024."</p><p>It heightened the sense of urgency surrounding a White House effort to convince Johnson to hold a public vote on Ukraine aid that has dragged on behind the scenes since the day he became speaker. Johnson had resisted for months in the face of growing threats to his speakership if he sided with Biden and allowed the vote.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350643815112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Since the last time Congress approved aid to Ukraine in late 2022, conservative skepticism of sending U.S. weapons and dollars to the country has grown, threatening Johnson’s speakership as well as Biden’s foreign policy agenda.</p><p>But he has now effectively locked arms with the president: Johnson's alignment with Biden this week has extended at times even to deploying similar talking points in favor of funding Ukraine, and comes in defiance of efforts by conservatives like Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/405104" data-person-id="405104" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1713487384397,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1713487384397,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;405104\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/405104\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Sen.

It would stabilize a Ukrainian defense running low on munitions and bracing for a renewed Russian offensive in early summer.</p><p>It’s also validation, Biden aides and allies said, of a White House strategy focused on slowly courting Johnson behind the scenes while letting him find his own path to a solution — even if it meant weathering frequent setbacks and building frustration within its own party.</p><p>"Everybody knows we've got to get Ukraine funding," said another lawmaker, a Democrat close to the White House, “We're at the precipice."</p><p>Johnson had grown increasingly vocal for the last several weeks in privately promising lawmakers that he'd allow Ukraine aid to come to the floor for a vote. With other pressing priorities such as government funding and spy authority stacked through March and into April, this week provided one of the first openings to move on Ukraine.</p><p>“Here is an opportunity to make that stand at a really crucial time in world history," he said on CNN on Wednesday, framing the aid push as a moral imperative for the GOP and critical to standing up to Russia's aggression.</p><p>Over the past several months, the White House sought to build indirect pressure on Johnson, stressing the seriousness of the situation to Ukraine-sympathetic GOP lawmakers. The administration held several closed-door briefings for Johnson and other lawmakers to update them on the deteriorating situation in Ukraine, starting just days after Johnson became speaker.</p><p>Senior Biden officials, including Burns and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, have also kept in close personal touch with a handful of lawmakers to discuss the evolving intel.</p><p>“Speaker Johnson understands the gravity of the situation. He's been provided with different information now,” said Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/192907" data-person-id="192907" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1713487428885,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1713487428885,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;192907\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/192907\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Sen.

Pressure from the White House and Ukraine-supporting lawmakers was building. Conservatives opposed to helping Ukraine made clear they'd threaten Johnson's job no matter how he handled the situation. And Iran's strikes on Israel generated renewed momentum for crafting an overall aid package that could help a range of U.S. allies.</p><p>It was the kind of opening that Democrats had hoped for months they could convince Johnson to seize before it was too late.</p><p>"I think he's made some hard choices and he's putting his job in peril as a result," said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/66846" data-person-id="66846" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1713487441381,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1713487441381,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;66846\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/66846\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Rep.

"I don't think I agree with him politically on anything, but I do think he has integrity. And I do think he's acting like a leader."</p><p>The White House declined to comment on its discussions with Johnson and the speaker’s camp pointed to his recent interview on CNN and other media outlets. The administration has steered clear of the debate in Congress this week for fear of derailing the aid package.</p><p>Biden during a Monday night call urged Johnson to pass the new funding by the end of the week. But he's been out of town since then, and has not addressed the effort beyond a short statement of support.</p><p>Republicans who support Ukraine have largely dismissed suggestions that Biden has played any defining role in delivering a Ukraine aid bill. They have long argued the president hasn’t made strong enough use of his bully pulpit to make the case for defending Ukraine against Russian aggression.</p><p>“I'm not trying to take a cheap shot at the administration, but they have not really done a very good job of extending an olive branch,” Tillis said.</p><p>Biden allies said the president and his top aides have prodded Johnson since he took over as speaker, encouraging him to hold a public vote on the Ukraine aid he privately told them he supported. That backchannel remained open even as the White House publicly criticized Johnson for rejecting a Senate-passed bill that would have sent funds to Ukraine.</p><p>The administration has “been pushing and they think he has the insight and intelligence as well as the temperament to be a listener," said Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151824" data-person-id="151824" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1713487459865,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1713487459865,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;151824\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151824\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Sen.

Throughout David’s childhood, Joan spent time in institutions and eventually was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. David always wondered whether something in her past had triggered it; all he knew was that his mother had been adopted from Greece when she was young, and that something tragic had happened to her parents.</p><p>As a kid, David never dared to broach the subject. But in 2013, when he was 26 and back home visiting from grad school, he worked up the nerve to talk to his father. “Did something happen to mom when she was young?”</p><p>“She said it’s OK for me to tell you,” his dad finally explained one evening after David had been asking for months. “Her father was executed in Greece by firing squad. He was something political.”</p><p>A few days later, David’s father passed him copies of his mother’s birth parents’ death certificates. David typed his grandfather’s name, Elias Argyriadis, into Google. He read that Joan’s father had been a communist leader who had been accused of espionage and sentenced to death in Athens in 1952.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/4e/d1/1e6aa95e4cb58318d6f16a0ce888/mag-bateman-greekadoptions-elias.jpg" /><br /><p>David was ecstatic at finally solving the puzzle of his mother’s past. But just as one question was answered, a dozen others popped up. If her father was executed in Greece, then how had she been adopted in the U.S.? What exactly had her adopted parents — who were now both dead — known about it? And did she still have relatives in Greece?</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, David was about to unravel a hidden-away part of history, intertwined with Cold War politics, secrets and lies, that is still affecting the daily lives of hundreds of American citizens. And he would also soon find out that 5,000 miles away, on the other side of the Atlantic, someone else had been trying to solve the mystery of what happened to his mother, too.</p><p>David’s mother Joan's adoption was not a one-off, but part of a larger phenomenon that took place after the end of the Greek Civil War in 1949. Although not as well-known as the Vietnamese or Korean wars, it is considered the first proxy conflict of the Cold War. The U.S. and U.K. backed a right-wing royalist government, and communist states supported leftist guerrilla fighters.</p><p>The conflict also gave rise to the world's first inter-country adoption industry. Throughout the 1950s and ’60s, around 4,000 Greek children were adopted abroad, mostly by Americans — and often in questionable circumstances.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/50/8c/87e52bd74d3aa49b64415f425f55/mag-bateman-greekadoptions-handsup.jpg" /><br /><p>Many early adoptees were the orphaned children of rebel leftist fighters, whom Western-backed Greek politicians hoped could be “reeducated” to be sympathetic to the West and antagonistic to communism. But as the U.S. economy boomed in the 1950s, and the nuclear family became the suburban ideal, some Americans began to view Greece as an easy source of white, adoptable babies. An endeavor to home needy children eventually expanded to a broader population of the poor in Greece, growing into a full-on baby trafficking racket that is only now being fully understood. Mothers in Greece were pressured to give up children, and adoptive parents did not have to undergo any screening so long as they could pay the fees.</p><p>Cold War-era narratives about “saving” children from communism, and Greece’s post-war economic reliance on the United States, motivated both the people pushing adoptions and the families who received children in the U.S. “We cannot understand the adoptions outside of the context of Cold War ideologies,” says historian Christos Triantafyllou, a postdoctoral researcher at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. “Communism was perceived to be an illness, [and] Western liberal democracy was considered the only pathway for Greece.” The children sent to the U.S. “embodied the hope that Greece would remain on the correct side.”<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/90/16/901999f14091a80c3fb4a17dfa56/mag-bateman-greekadoptions-refugees.jpg" /><br /><p>The majority of Greek adoptees in the U.S. from that era still don’t know who their biological families are. The convoluted proxies that were used in most cases mean that many don’t have a parent’s name on their birth certificates.

Elias is sitting in court, staring straight at the camera, with an anguished look in his eye. Around her living room, rows of wooden shelves were stuffed with books on Greek history and communist politics. Now 84, Efi could still recall in vivid detail the day in 1951 when her younger sisters, Ioanna, aged 6, and Olympia, aged 3, were taken by police.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/b1/90/3dc10a634329967b7c8d5efa5a02/mag-bateman-greekadoptions-efi.jpg" /><br /><p>Greece had been brutally occupied by the Nazis during World War II. Guerrilla fighters — many of whom supported the Greek communist party — fought against Germany and Italy, alongside the allies. But after the Nazis were defeated, the rebel fighters demanded a say in the running of newly liberated Greece. The country’s strategic position between Europe and the Middle East meant Western governments could not stomach the thought of it turning communist. The U.K. and U.S. turned on the leftist fighters they had previously collaborated with, backing a right-wing, semi-autocratic government in the ensuing civil war.</p><p>After the government’s victory, it set about persecuting communists — or anyone perceived to be one — with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/30/athens-1944-britains-dirty-secret" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;particular brutality&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/30/athens-1944-britains-dirty-secret&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d6b0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d6b0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">particular brutality</a>. The Greek communist party, the KKE, was outlawed and members were imprisoned, exiled, tortured and executed. The country’s main income source was aid from the Marshall Plan, meaning U.S. influence loomed large.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/ab/ca/f72b611346c2b729e79efc1d756c/mag-bateman-greekadoptions-guerillas.jpg" /><br /><p>Children of leftists were also targeted, with both sides accusing the other of brainwashing the young. Greece’s Queen Frederica ran a network of “orphanages” where children of dead, exiled or imprisoned leftists were sent for “re-education,” while many leftist families smuggled children across borders to countries now behind the Iron Curtain of Soviet control.</p><p>Efi’s father Elias was a high-ranking KKE member. The family lived on a poultry farm on the outskirts of Athens, with a secret bunker underneath where he communicated via radio with exiled comrades in eastern Europe. When the house was eventually raided by police in November 1951, he was accused of spying for the USSR and thrown in jail along with his wife Katerina Dalla — the mother of the two younger girls. When Dalla was released a few days later, Efi says her head was wrapped in bandages and she claimed she had been tortured with a vise-like device. Dalla then killed herself by jumping out a window of the family home.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/ca/8f/b2111d9b406b9672abf27cd9036e/mag-bateman-greekadoptions-efiarrest.jpg" /><br /><p>On November 30, 1951, just three days after Dalla’s suicide, a statement by the president of Greece’s child protection agency, Lina Tsaldari — who would go on to become the minister for social welfare — was published on the front page of <i>Ta Nea</i>, a leading right-wing newspaper. “What will become of [Argyriadis’s] children?” it asked. "We want them to be given back to us [i.e., to Greece], regardless of whether they have lived in a communist climate.”</p><p>Alone with her two younger sisters, 13-year-old Efi tried her hardest to maintain a sense of normality. She bribed the police officers surrounding the house to go fetch groceries and cooked the girls their grandmother’s meatball recipe. On December 7 — the day she describes as “the worst of them all” — a jeep pulled up outside and four police officers stepped out. Efi screamed and wrestled with them, as they grabbed Ioanna and Olympia from her.</p><p>The girls were placed with a foster family in a nearby suburb while Efi stayed in the family property with an aunt and uncle. One day when Efi went to visit, the foster parents told her the girls were gone and to never come back. Efi could not find out anything more. It was as if they had disappeared.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/7e/e5/bd6566ec47d488a90438f61a98b2/mag-bateman-greekadoptions-newspapers2.jpg" /><br /><p>Elias Argyriadis and three co-defendants were sentenced to death on March 1, 1952, despite international outcry and a telegram campaign supported by figures including Pablo Picasso. The men refused to be blindfolded as they stood in front of a firing squad.</p><p>Efi decided immediately that she would make it her life’s work to find out what happened to her sisters.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Unbeknownst to Efi, Greek social</b> services — which had embraced the anti-communist fervor — had arranged for the sisters to be adopted by Paul and Athena Scangas, two politically conservative second-generation Greek Americans. The couple were the epitome of the American dream: Paul was a successful dairy entrepreneur and Athena a proud homemaker, and they lived in a palatial house in suburban Massachusetts. According to Greek newspaper articles eventually published in 1980 recounting the girls’ adoption records, the Scangases knew who the girls’ parents were and how they had died.</p><p>Ioanna, whose name was anglicized to Joan, and Olympia, who was re-baptized as Kathryn, had every material comfort imaginable. However, according to relatives, discussions about their life in Greece were strictly off-limits. As Ioanna/Joan grew older and suffered periods of mental illness, the family became even more guarded about hiding the past for fear of triggering her. Olympia/Kathryn, who died of cancer in 2021, did not have the same mental health struggles, yet she refrained from searching for relatives in Greece in case it upset her adoptive parents.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/b6/3a/f323e522471bbd77a051e65823aa/mag-bateman-greekadoptions-family-bench.jpg" /><br /><p>It was clear to David from his first Google search that his mother’s adoption was historically significant. However, he struggled to find more information about Joan’s relatives. None of his family knew — or would admit to knowing — very much, and there was little else online or in books. So he emailed various academics specializing in modern Greece, briefly explaining his family history. One of these was Gonda Van Steen, a specialist in Greek language and literature at King’s College London.</p><p>The email took Van Steen by surprise when she received it in 2013. She Googled “illegal Greek adoptions” and found a cluster of lurid news articles from the 1990s about stolen babies. Then she consulted her history books — but found nothing. In Greek newspaper archives she managed to find various interviews Efi had given, demanding to know what happened to her sisters. But none of the coverage had made it across the Atlantic.</p><p>As Van Steen continued digging, she realized Joan’s adoption was just the tip of an iceberg. While 1950s Greece struggled with the aftermath of war, the U.S. was booming. Within the country, the number of babies available for adoption couldn’t keep up with the families who wanted them. Van Steen soon found herself down a research rabbit-hole, which resulted in her 2019 book, <i>Adoption, Memory and Cold War Greece: Kid pro quo?</i> Van Steen found that Queen Frederica’s “re-education” orphanages were expensive to run, and they were filling up with the children of poor unwed mothers. Foreign adoption offered a cost-saving solution.</p><p>Frederica had a powerful Greek American ally in Spyros P. Skouras, then-president of the film studio 21st Century Fox, and together they ran glamorous fundraising events across the U.S. for “The Queen’s Orphans Fund.” She also drummed up favorable press coverage in magazines including <i>Life</i> and <i>Time</i>. Archive images show Hollywood stars such as Marlon Brando and Jane Russell — founder of the World Adoption International Fund and one of the first “celebrity adopters” — posing with Greek orphans. Newspapers frequently ran stories on orphan arrivals, often mentioning the “communist fighting” they had been rescued from.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/7c/49/9a2c24a14bab991d177e6dbb7a67/mag-bateman-greekadoptions-ethel.jpg" /><br /><p>Most of these adoptions were organized by the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association (AHEPA), a fraternal organization originally established to “Americanize” Greek migrants. AHEPA developed the “proxy adoption” model, which is when parents use a representative to adopt a child abroad. This means the adoptive parents don’t meet the child beforehand, nor are they vetted by social services.</p><p>Cold War politics also softened immigration laws. President Eisenhower’s 1953 Refugee Relief Act made it easier for Europeans who were victims or opponents of communism to flee to the U.S. It also rapidly sped up international adoption, with the majority of visas for Greek children issued under this act. The same year, Greece and the U.S. signed bilateral agreements prioritizing American investment and security presence in the country. As the dependent country, Greece was soon expected to also provide a steady stream of adoptable children, and Greek politicians understood these children could become an excellent diplomatic relations tool.</p><p>The earliest adoptions sought to place children with conservative, well-off Greek Americans like the Scangases. But as soon as central AHEPA figures understood how much money could be made from American families desperate for a child, things began to change.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Maria Papadopolou was</b> 10 years old when she was told she and her three brothers had been adopted from Greece. Her adoptive parents, who were prominent Mormons in Salt Lake City, explained they had been unable to conceive, and so had asked her uncle — a Stanford professor who traveled regularly — to find them adoptable children abroad. He noticed Maria in an Athens orphanage when she was one. Her parents explained to her that her birth mother hadn’t wanted her. From their description, her mother had been a reckless, uneducated young woman, and Maria would have had no life in Greece.</p><br /><p><br />But the adoptive household wasn’t a happy one. Maria describes growing up within Mormon culture as “hell.” Her adoptive parents were strong Type A personalities, ill-equipped to deal with the challenges that may come with adopting multiple children from a different culture. When Maria left home at age 20, her adoptive mother told her never to come back. “You’re on your own now,” she said. (Maria requested we refer to her by her birth name, rather than the name she grew up with after she was adopted.)</p><p>As Maria grew up and had two children of her own, she never stopped wondering about her birth family. She wanted to know who she looked like. According to Rachel Winslow, author of <i>The Best Possible Immigrants: International Adoption and the American Family,</i> Greek adoptees were popular because they were considered white. However, growing up in Utah surrounded by people of Northern European ancestry, Maria always stood out. People often struggled to place her ethnicity or would speak to her in Spanish.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/63/c8/8771e009498c83bedf3ab795801c/mag-bateman-greekadoptions-mariachildren.jpg" /><br /><p>Her older daughter Alexis, who is now 33, eventually decided to conduct a search. “[My mom’s life] has been really hard,” Alexis told me. “I think she deserves to have her history and identity restored to her.”</p><p>Alexis tried various tactics, such as reaching out to the Greek consulate in the U.S., but was constantly stonewalled. Then in 2021, she came across an article about Van Steen’s book, and decided to email her. Van Steen took a look at Maria’s adoption papers and saw her mother’s name was right there — the family had never realized, as they didn’t speak Greek. Within five days, they had found her biological family on Facebook.</p><p>From looking through the unpublished memoirs of Maria’s uncle, the Stanford professor, and comparing them to emails and interviews with her biological family in Greece, a different story emerged than the one Maria had been told. Maria’s mother was in her early 20s and became pregnant when she was raped by the owner of a farm she worked on. As an unwed mother she was shunned by her rural community and moved to the capital, Athens, where she took a job as a hospital cleaner. She placed Maria in an orphanage but visited her every single day. Crucially, she did not give permission for her to be adopted.</p><p>When Maria’s uncle came to browse the orphanage in 1953, he decided Maria looked like “one of the healthiest” children. The orphanage said he could take her as long as her mother agreed. He and a lawyer confronted her at her workplace and pressured her to sign the papers, telling her the child would have a better life in America than she could ever give it. In his memoir he describes tears rolling down the woman’s face.</p><p>The Orthodox Church in Greece was not happy that the family were Mormon, as Greek American parents were still prioritized at that time. But Maria’s uncle was friends with the U.S. ambassador, Cavendish W. Cannon, who knew the head of the Greek Orthodox Church personally, and intervened to complete the adoption.</p><p>“I’d been told my mother didn’t want me, but that wasn’t true,” says Maria. “None of it was true.” And there was more. Maria’s mother was still alive.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Political adoptions continued up until </b>around 1955. After that, they were largely driven by economics. According to U.S. visa records collated by Van Steen, 3,116 children were adopted from Greece between 1948 and 1962 — 16 percent of the total number of foreign-born adoptees. “Greek children became part of the exchange of goods and services that the Marshall Plan had initiated,” writes Van Steen.</p><p>AHEPA began prioritizing non-Greek American adoptive parents, to whom it charged inflated fees of up to $2,800 per adoption — equivalent to $30,000 today. Most children brought to the U.S. were labeled as “orphans” or “foundlings” — a common story was that the child had been found in a basket in front of an orphanage. The children arrived as blank slates, their histories erased. However, there was no way to verify whether these stories were true. Some may have genuinely been abandoned, but Van Steen believes a significant number of parents were coerced or manipulated, like Maria’s mother.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/97/6e/9abcc6de41679a5c7d7285ad1380/mag-bateman-greekadoptions-school.jpg" /><br /><p>Complaints began circling in the mid-1950s about AHEPA’s failure to screen adoptive families and its refusal to work with child welfare professionals. In 1959, the Greek left-wing newspaper <i>Eleftheria</i> published a three-part investigation exposing the baby trade and detailing the risks of proxy adoption.</p><p>There was public outcry in Greece.

Scopas — a well-known New York magistrate — was arrested on child trafficking charges. “SCOPAS ARRESTED IN SALE OF BABIES,” blared a May 1959 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1959/05/05/archives/scopas-arrested-in-sale-of-babies-exmagistrate-and-lawyer-accused.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;i>New York Times&lt;/i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1959/05/05/archives/scopas-arrested-in-sale-of-babies-exmagistrate-and-lawyer-accused.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d6d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d6d0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>New York Times</i></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1959/05/05/archives/scopas-arrested-in-sale-of-babies-exmagistrate-and-lawyer-accused.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot; headline&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1959/05/05/archives/scopas-arrested-in-sale-of-babies-exmagistrate-and-lawyer-accused.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d6d0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d6d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">headline</a>. But he was eventually acquitted as the proxy adoptions occurred in Greece, rendering them outside the jurisdiction of New York courts. The number of Greece-to-U.S. adoptions dwindled to less than 10 a year, consigning the era to the dustiest corners of history by the time the adoptees grew up. <br /></p><br /><p><b>After her sisters were taken</b>, Efi spent the next 25 years wondering if they were even alive. She was stonewalled, dismissed and harassed by authorities every time she tried to push for information. Greece was ruled by a military dictatorship in the late ’60s to mid ’70s, making it impossible to communicate with anyone in power.</p><p>In 1980 a Greek film about the executed communists, <i>The Man with the Carnation</i>, was released, and Efi saw a chance to get press attention. She gave an interview with a left-wing newspaper, which then ran an editorial demanding the government reveal what happened to the children.</p><p>Efi teamed up with a journalist to badger officials. Eventually, a minister tipped her off as to which government office she should look in. When the pair arrived, they saw a sign saying “adoptions.” The reporter headed into the documents section, eventually emerging with a file in his hand. “I found it,” he said.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/d0/67/151f9e5d4b9b844205448b6c43c6/mag-bateman-greekadoptions-adoptionday.jpg" /><br /><p>The papers inside told the entire story: how the girls had been adopted, and even the names of their new parents. Through a contact in the Greek Orthodox Church in the U.S., she tracked down Ioanna/Joan’s home address.</p><p>Efi wrote several letters to her sister throughout the 1980s and ‘90s. But she never received a response. On the other side of the Atlantic, Joan’s husband — David’s father — was intercepting them. <br /></p><br /><p><b>In May 2021, Maria Papadopolou,</b> her daughter Alexis and son Madison touched down in Athens. They waited nervously outside their hotel as a taxi pulled up and an old woman stepped out. She was short — below five feet — and had clearly dressed up in her best clothes: a red lace blouse, pearl necklace and matching earrings.</p><p>Her eyes fixed on Maria as she walked towards her. Maria could immediately see how alike they looked. She’d always joked that she was built like a refrigerator — straight up and down — and her mother had the exact same shape. Her adult children — Maria’s brother and sister — were with her, along with their own children.</p><p>As she approached, the old woman burst into tears, then reached and grabbed Maria, refusing to let her go. The group walked to a restaurant, with her mother clutching her hand the entire time. Over a meal of meze they spoke in a mixture of Greek, with Maria’s biological nephew translating, and broken English. Maria’s mother wouldn’t take her eyes off her. She explained she had always wanted to search for Maria, too, but hadn’t known how. She still had her baby blanket.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/60/0b/8d2b78f746c4b034cf32719cfc1b/mag-bateman-greekadoptions-maria.jpg" /><br /><p>Maria had hoped to return to Greece again one day. But two years later, in the spring of 2023 she noticed people posting condolences in Greek on her biological brother’s Facebook wall. Her siblings confirmed her mother had died.</p><p>“Just from that one meeting, I miss her so much,” she said. “And I wish I could have had more time with her.”<br /></p><br /><p><b>After he learned from Van Steen</b> of his Aunt Efi’s existence, David organized a trip to meet her in Athens in the summer of 2014. As he stepped out the elevator in her apartment building he saw her standing in the doorway, the light from the room behind illuminating her like a halo. She grabbed him in a strong embrace, holding him tight for several minutes. As he walked into the apartment he saw the picture of Elias, his grandfather, on the wall. He recognized the man's solemn expression, sculptural nose and rounded cheeks. "That's my mom's face," he thought.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/49/b0/12d789c94635b175524ba32ecd62/mag-bateman-greekadoptions-monument.jpg" /><br /><p>Over the next few days, he debriefed with Efi and her husband and daughter over cups of strong Greek coffee. David’s aunt Olympia/Kathryn also finally arranged a visit that year, too. She told Efi she could still remember the meatballs she used to cook before the family was split apart.</p><p>After some persuasion David’s father eventually agreed to facilitate a call between Efi and Ioanna/Joan. David and the rest of the family stood staring as Efi, perched on the side of her bed, spoke to Joan in Greek for around three minutes. David was surprised — he had never heard his mother speaking the language before.</p><p>After Efi hung up the family rushed to hug her, then they all retired to the lounge while talking excitedly. David sent his father a quick text to ask how Joan had handled the conversation. His reply was unexpected: “I don’t think she fully understood who she was speaking to.” His father elaborated, explaining that Joan’s health had deteriorated that summer. She was suffering severe memory loss.</p><p>David stood there, feeling the burden of the news, as he listened to his Greek family celebrating. He wondered if it would be cruel to puncture their happiness. “Then I thought, so much of this damn story is people withholding information,” he says. “I just don’t want to continue that.” He walked into the lounge and told the family about the conversation he just had, and immediately felt the atmosphere in the room fall flat.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/2f/7d/fa26a826487ba6da767791cc9d69/mag-bateman-greekadoptions-joan.jpg" /><br /><p>Joan’s dementia rapidly accelerated after David returned to the U.S., and she died in April 2020. Despite all the research, the conversations and the reunions, David feels there will always be something missing. All the attempts to tie up loose ends can never make up for the many years spent apart.</p><p>“There’s always going to be a gap there that we can’t fill,” he says. “And I’ve learnt that all you can do is try to make the frame surrounding that gap as beautiful as possible.”</p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

The center represented a major expansion of the university’s small facility in the capital, and it’s been a hit: Within a year, ASU had added nearly 10,000 more square feet of real estate in a nearby building.</p><p>At least one institution may have watched ASU’s D.C. expansion with some anxiety: the school’s cross-state rival, the University of Arizona.</p><p>Before long, the Tucson-based flagship school asked its Board of Regents to fund U of A’s own Washington outpost, a somewhat smaller 14,000-square-foot affair only two blocks from the executive mansion. After a Covid-induced delay, the Washington, D.C. Center for Outreach &amp; Collaboration staged a weeklong inaugural in 2021 with events for media, alums and Arizona-adjacent policymakers.</p><p>The lesson for non-Arizonans: Apparently no one wants to be the last college on the block without a Washington campus.</p><p>The past few years have seen a fraternity-style rush of American universities planting their flags or significantly boosting their landholdings in Washington, including five in 2023 alone: Texas A&amp;M, the University of Southern California, Purdue, Princeton and Johns Hopkins, which spent $372 million to buy the majestic former Newseum building on Pennsylvania Avenue and turn it into its Bloomberg Center, “where Washington comes to think.”<br /></p><br /><p>“It’s become almost like a new thing for everyone to have,” said Don DeMaria, who runs the Washington program of the University of Georgia, which since 2015 has been based in Delta Hall, a Capitol Hill facility with dorms for 32 students and a red door designed to look like the buildings on the university’s Athens campus — and paid for with help from the Atlanta-based airline. “Once they recognize the benefits of having your own place, hanging your name out there and making the facility the way you would want it to be, everyone wants to do it.”</p><p>The newest newcomers join a roster of satellite campuses that has quietly grown to at least 50, according to data from the Washington, D.C., Economic Partnership. Americans may view the nation’s capital as a vaguely foreign cesspool. But the nation’s universities seem eager to help their students study abroad there — a phenomenon that has almost as much to do with status and money as it does with education.</p><p>It’s a pricey academic trend that spans from large public schools like the University of California to small private ones like Middlebury College, from secular schools like New York University to conservative religious ones like Hillsdale College, and from venerable elites like the University of Pennsylvania (founded in 1740 by Benjamin Franklin) to relatively young establishments like Florida International University (founded in 1965 by the Florida legislature).</p><p>And if D.C.’s mayor gets her way, there will be more where that came from: Luring still more university outposts is a key part of the city’s plan to revive a downtown that is still struggling from Covid-era abandonment.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/20/1d/efb40f114c3781f9c2dcd0d48d7c/ap23292623491005.jpg" /><br /><p>For a local government, it makes a lot of sense: If you take an office building whose workers no longer come downtown, and you fill it with students instead, you get a population of people who spend money in local stores, go out to local eateries and otherwise pad the city tax base — but don’t put much strain on municipal finances because they tend not to use social services or have kids in public school.</p><p>“Are you kidding? We think it’s great,” said Leona Agouridis, the CEO of the Golden Triangle Business Improvement District, which covers the western half of D.C.’s downtown. When Agouridis first came to the organization, 18 years ago, there were no university outposts in her bailiwick. Now there are six big ones. “The businesses nearby see students purchasing food and coffee, seeking entertainment. In a post-Covid world with all of this office space it does provide another source of demand for excess office space.”</p><p>For a university, the goals are a little more varied — a mixture of prestige, fundraising, lobbying, networking and internship opportunities.</p><p>In its own way, it’s a metaphor for Washington, with some actual classroom education thrown in, too.</p><p>Last spring, when the University of Southern California opened its $50 million, 60,000-square-foot Capital Campus in the Connecticut Avenue building formerly occupied by the National Association of Broadcasters, the school’s legendary marching band was on-hand for a kickoff event at the Lincoln Memorial, and the university’s president referred to the new facility as the “Trojan Embassy” in Washington.</p><p>The comparison is apt. Just like having a diplomatic mission in the capital of the United States helps establish a newly independent nation as a legitimate international entity, the very fact of having a Washington satellite helps a university telegraph its national scope.</p><p>That’s not purely a vanity play, either. Particularly for public universities, enrolling foreign students represents a cash cow because they pay full freight — and, conventional wisdom has it, having a Beltway presence helps assure parents back in Kolkata or Shanghai that a school like Arizona State is a big deal, a place worth the investment.</p><p>Setting up shop in Washington can have other effects on a university’s bottom line. The capital is thick with alums of nearly every school — a demographic school fundraisers are forever trying to keep connected to the alma mater in ways that events at a gleaming new college outpost could facilitate. And as an epicenter of grant-making agencies, Washington is a place where having a footprint can pay off: Anyone can hire a lobbyist, but having actual scholars on the ground is an even better look.</p><p>“Having access to government and all those resources is useful in the same way as if you’re doing medical research, it’s good to be next to a great hospital,” said Erin Talkington, a managing director of RCLCO Real Estate Advisors, which contributed to the downtown plan.</p><p>Weirdly, the low image of politics nationally may be one of the things spurring interest in creating Beltway campuses. The number of humanities majors has shrunk by comparison to the number of STEM majors, which leaves departments like political science fighting for market share — and more keen on providing students a memorable experience.</p><p>“Why go into politics? It’s ugly, it doesn’t pay. It’s so much easier to be a programming major,” said Andrea Mayer, who runs the University of Illinois’ Washington program, an internship-centric semester that’s akin to studying abroad. Her program remains relatively small, but the investments in D.C. space are “part of a larger effort to keep liberal arts relevant and, more importantly, useful to the students. We want to see people having lovely, plugged-in careers.”</p><p>Michael Hartnett, who studies Beltway-area real estate trends at the real estate titan Jones Lang Lasalle, said he expects the trend to continue, with or without a nudge from City Hall. Among other reasons, it’s a remarkably good time to score commercial real estate in Washington, where the central district remains a shadow of its former self, with 20 million square feet of vacant office space.</p><p>“Clearly with colleges and universities, they’re very focused on the physical footprint,” Harnett said. “It’s great for reinvigorating downtown from not just an occupancy perspective, but also from a foot traffic point of view.”<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/09/69/849f073d41e9ab1bcec3b087c01c/mediahandout-barrettoconnorcenter-04.JPG" /><br /><p>But the more interesting long-term question is what this means for the culture of the capital, a place where the downtown office quarter stereotype involves lanyard-wearing professionals who are en route back to the suburbs by the time the sun sets.</p><p>Right now, few of the downtown-based universities have housing akin to Georgia’s, though several control blocks of apartments in adjacent neighborhoods. But Gerren Price, who leads the DowntownDC Business Improvement District, told me student housing could be a way to convert underused office buildings that can’t easily be turned into actual apartments.</p><p>“It’s mostly designed for employees working 9 to 5, punching in, punching out,” he said. “But that can change.”</p><p>Alas, Washingtonians will likely be disappointed if they imagine that the plan to flood students into the area is going to give the place a Latin Quarter vibe. With programming that focuses heavily on politics and policy, the campus outposts are likely to be full of slightly younger versions of exactly the same folks who usually move to D.C. after graduation: There’s not a lot of stuff designed for poets or film majors.</p><p>Even Hillsdale, the Michigan college that has become a center of evangelical culture and politics, seems content to leave the actual theology scholars back home. Hillsdale in D.C., its mission statement says, “seeks to inspire and form students, citizens, practitioners, and statesmen, who will restore America’s principles and revive self-government in the political life of our nation.”</p><p>Hartnett, though, says he’s been impressed that some of the programming at the largest new outposts, like USC’s, focuses on things like AI and cybersecurity, government-adjacent but luring a different type of student. From an economic point of view, he sees the presence of a critical mass of people rotating in and out of internships as something that could lure employers, too, a phenomenon he calls “clustering.”</p><p>Intentionally or not, the dynamic seems to represent a pretty good advertisement for a capital that has gotten lousy press lately. “We promote it as an opportunity to work in the city, but it’s the living in the city that the students really enjoy,” said David Jones, who leads the Washington program of James Madison University. It’s a phenomenon that makes the capital an attractive place to settle once graduation rolls around.</p><p>“I have students who tell me they choose the University of Georgia over even a D.C. school because they can get a D.C. experience but at a University of Georgia price,” said DeMaria, who runs the school’s Washington program. He said his program is especially popular with students about to graduate because of the networking opportunities. “They look while they’re in D.C., which is a real advantage,” he said. “They’re job searching ahead of their peers.”</p><p>The universities, of course, have their own motivations.</p><p>Last year’s splashiest university-outpost debut, for instance, got the phone ringing anew at the DowntownDC organization — not from students who want to relocate, but from colleges that want to keep up with the Joneses.</p><p>“There are a number of people who have reached out with interest, particularly in light of the USC expansion,” Price said. “Keep watching.”<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

NYSERDA confirmed that was the main reason no final awards were made. A smaller turbine means a project would need more individual turbine locations to deliver the same power — and the costs would have been higher.</p><p>NYSERDA had also tentatively awarded $300 million to GE Vernova and LM Wind Power for investments in nacelle and blade manufacturing at new facilities along the Hudson River near Albany. That money will be made available through a new competitive solicitation, according to the authority.</p><p>“NYSERDA remains committed to advancing New York’s offshore wind industry in pursuit of the state’s Climate Act goals,” spokesperson Kate Muller said in a statement. “Next steps will be announced in the near future.”</p><p>The authority was already expected to start another round of offshore wind bids and may accelerate those efforts. NYSERDA’s schedule for the offshore wind projects called for contracts to be executed by the end of last month. GE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>It's not the total end of offshore wind in New York but does represent a setback. There are still some projects off the coast of Long Island and New Jersey on the drawing board and one is already operational.</p><p>The projects that were negotiating contracts are the 1,404 MW Attentive Energy One project being developed by TotalEnergies, Rise Light and Power and Corio Generation; the 1,314 MW Community Offshore Wind project developed by RWE Offshore Renewables and National Grid Ventures; and the 1,314 MW Excelsior Wind developed by Vineyard Offshore with backing from Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.</p><p>But those would now need to rely on smaller 15.5 MW turbines — which means the developers would have needed to buy more and install more massive underwater foundations to put each turbine atop.

Sadly, this happens all too often. These regulations promote accountability by requiring schools to take swift action responsive to sex discrimination.”</p><p>The changes drew praise from civil rights advocates and LGBTQ+ groups while prompting a strong rebuke from Republican lawmakers and conservative organizations concerned about due process rights for students accused of misconduct, and protecting sex-separated spaces and programs. Still, civil right groups remain frustrated that Cardona hasn’t delivered on a separate rule overseeing school sports participation for transgender students.</p><p>During the rulemaking process, the hotly contested proposed policy drew more than 240,000 comments and faced several delays to its release since its initial unveiling in 2022. Cardona’s final rule will be officially published later this month, Biden administration officials said, and take effect in August, before the 2024-25 school year.</p><p>It’s also almost certain to be hit with legal challenges.</p><p>“The rule is unlawful. We and a coalition of interested parties will challenge it in court, and it will ultimately be struck down,” said Jennifer Braceras, founder of the Independent Women’s Law Center and a former commissioner of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.</p><p>The administration’s announcement makes good on President Joe Biden’s 2020 <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/06/biden-vows-a-quick-end-to-devos-sexual-misconduct-rule-241715" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;campaign promise&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/06/biden-vows-a-quick-end-to-devos-sexual-misconduct-rule-241715&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d820000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8d820001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">campaign promise</a> to unravel much of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’ Title IX rule, a defining policy of her time in office. The Biden administration’s rule is also the second major regulatory overhaul of the federal government’s interpretation of the law in two presidential administrations.</p><p>DeVos railed against the new plan on Friday for its gender identity provision and changing her process for sexual misconduct investigations.</p><p>"This is a regulation no one needed and very few wanted," the former Education secretary said in a statement. "Our rule, the current one, was working well. By contrast, the Obama-Biden rules I inherited drew bipartisan outrage about the horrors they were creating on campuses, and the courts were routinely having to intervene. None of that was the case when Biden took office. This is an endeavor born entirely of progressive politics, not sound policy."</p><p>Instead, she said, Biden was doing a "u-turn to the bad old days where sexual misconduct was sent to campus kangaroo courts, not resolved in a way that actually sought justice."</p><h2 style="text-align: left">Responding to sexual misconduct</h2><p>DeVos’ rule took effect in August 2020 and has been in effect for most of Biden’s presidency. It narrowed the definition of sexual harassment and directed schools to conduct live hearings with cross-examination for sexual misconduct probes. She has said her rule was designed to protect fairness in investigations for those who are accused of misconduct and force schools to issue prompt action.</p><p>Advocacy groups representing students who have experienced sexual misconduct have been urging the Biden administration to swiftly roll back DeVos’ rule.</p><p>With its rule, the Trump administration “unraveled critical protections for student survivors,” said Shiwali Patel, who is senior counsel for the National Women’s Law Center.</p><p>“For many students, a weakened Title IX harassment rule is all they’ve known through their college and high school experience,” Patel said.</p><p>Cardona’s final rule redefines sex-based harassment as “unwelcome sex-based conduct that creates a hostile environment by limiting or denying a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from a school’s education program or activity.” It also demands that schools take “prompt and effective action” to end any sex discrimination, and “treat complainants and respondents equitably.”</p><p>The DeVos rule only prohibits unwelcome sex-based misconduct if it is “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient’s education program or activity.”</p><p>Organizations representing the rights of students accused of sexual misconduct have pressed the Biden administration to keep the safeguards the DeVos rule included to require that every student receive a fair investigation.</p><p>The Biden administration said its rule “maintain[s] several major provisions from the current regulations.” The process is less prescriptive than what was issued under DeVos, but it emphasizes that a school may not punish a student while an investigation is in progress nor presume they are guilty of misconduct until a determination is made at the end of a school’s grievance procedures.</p><p>“Now, it’s up to school administrators to act quickly to implement and enforce the updated guidance,” said Emma Grasso Levine, senior manager of Title IX policy and programs at the nonprofit Know Your IX. “Student survivors of sexual violence, LGBTQ+ students, and pregnant and parenting students cannot afford to suffer any longer under policies that jeopardize their right to an education.”</p><h2 style="text-align: left">Protecting students from discrimination</h2><p>The Biden final rule would codify protections based on gender identity for the first time, safeguarding transgender and nonbinary students from discrimination. It also clarifies that schools must protect student-parents, pregnant students and employees from discrimination. This means schools must have “reasonable modifications” for students and employees, including space and time for lactation.</p><p>But much of the focus among advocacy groups on both sides of the rule is on transgender students.</p><p>“While we celebrate the significance of this moment, we are still urging a release of a final rule that explicitly clarifies what Title IX has always stood for and guarantees — that transgender, nonbinary and intersex athletes have a right to play sports alongside their peers,” Patel said.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, GOP lawmakers slammed the rule's protections for gender identity.

Those dynamics produced a smaller, more conservative electorate that is markedly different than the voters who cast a ballot for Newsom against the recall, the only item on the statewide ballot for the September 2021 special election. (A higher share of voters turned out then than did for the midterm elections a little more than a year later.)</p><p>In the final years of his tenure as governor, Newsom is looking to build his national profile and cement a legacy on California’s biggest policy issues via the state’s ballot-measure system. Understanding where he has drawn support in past races, and where he struggled to get the necessary backing for Prop 1, gives some indications as to where the California politician’s mobilization and persuasion effort for the measure fell short.</p><p>In that sense, the Prop 1 results demonstrate the limits of Newsom’s ability to influence voter behavior when he’s not on the ballot himself — particularly as he faces a growing state budget deficit, and as various Democratic constituencies hope to pass bonds this November on everything from climate to school funding to housing.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">Newsom's coalition, then and now</h2><p>California Democrats typically win statewide races by racking up votes along the Pacific Coast, from rural Humboldt County in the north down through the San Francisco Bay Area all the way to Los Angeles.

(The measure won above 50 percent in just six other counties: Santa Cruz, Monterey, Humboldt, Mendocino, Yolo and Sacramento, all either along the Pacific Coast or adjacent to the Bay Area.)<br /></p><br /><p>But in each case, the vote percentages for Prop 1 were significantly lower than those for Newsom in the 2021 recall, illustrating the areas in which differences between the two electorates were sharpest. In San Mateo County, wedged between San Francisco and the heart of Silicon Valley, support for Prop 1 was 20.8 percentage points lower than support for Newsom in 2021; in nearby Alameda County, it was 19.3 points lower; in Santa Clara County, it was 18.5 points lower.</p><p>The county with the biggest drop-off in support was Santa Cruz County, a coastal, forested region just south of the Bay Area: There, Prop 1 underperformed Newsom’s 2021 totals by 23.6 percentage points.</p><p>Still, even if the overall vote in favor was significantly below what Newsom won in his recall vote, the margin for Prop 1 in a handful of populous Bay Area counties — including San Francisco and Alameda, where Prop 1 got 61.9 percent of the vote — arguably helped give measure the votes needed to put it over the top.</p><p>"Even despite a rough statewide electorate, L.A. and Bay Area counties carried Prop 1 to victory," said longtime Newsom adviser Nathan Click. "And these were the markets where the governor was the primary messenger."</p><p>The only area where Prop 1 performed better than Newsom in the 2021 recall was the rural northeast, where support for Democrats is typically low. In Lassen County, for example, along California’s northern border with Nevada, Prop 1 overperformed Newsom by 8 points; in Shasta County, just west of Lassen, Prop 1 overperformed by 6.1 points.</p><p>This is the part of the state, though, where Newsom received his lowest support in 2021 — it did not take much to outdo the 2021 result. In Lassen County that year, just 15.8 percent of the electorate cast a ballot for Newsom; in this March’s primary, 23.8 percent voted for Prop 1.</p><p>It is also where the Yes on 1 campaign did not air any ads at all.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">Why Prop 1 fell short</h2><p>After helping usher his mental health package through the Legislature last summer, Newsom faced a choice about when to put it before voters. (Their approval was necessary because the law both amended a policy established by an earlier ballot measure and included a bond issue.)</p><p>If the measure went up for a vote in March, it would face a primary electorate that is always smaller and more conservative than turnout for general elections. If Newsom’s campaign had waited until November, it was likely to share the statewide ballot with several other bond measures. That juxtaposition might have turned off voters wary of authorizing too much government spending at once, and the competition for voter attention would have likely made the race more costly.</p><p>“Was it a risk going in March? Yes. But there was a strong bipartisan coalition behind Prop 1,” Anthony York, one of Newsom’s closest advisers on the Prop 1 campaign, said at a POLITICO event in late March. “If we wanted to do it the easy way we would have spent more money. We would have done it in November.”</p><p>Elections are won or lost on a combination of mobilization and persuasion: After taking political ownership of the measure, Newsom’s task was to both convince voters the $6.4 billion bond was good policy and also that it was important enough to drive them to the polls.</p><p>Early public polling showed overwhelming support for the measure, <a href="https://www.ppic.org/press-release/two-in-three-likely-voters-support-prop-1-the-march-ballot-measure-on-behavioral-health-services/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1713485516894,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1713485516894,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ppic.org/press-release/two-in-three-likely-voters-support-prop-1-the-march-ballot-measure-on-behavioral-health-services/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f3b2-dd90-a5ee-f7fa09b30001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;as high as 68 percent support&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f3b2-dd90-a5ee-f7fa09b30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">as high as 68 percent support</a> in late 2023. But below those impressive top-line numbers hid reasons for concern.

Nearly half of them, or 48 percent, said it wasn’t.</p><p>Newsom’s advisers have said the measure was never as popular as public surveys showed. But they largely attributed Prop 1’s narrower-than-expected victory to unexpectedly low turnout in the March primary. Just 35 percent of eligible voters showed up to the polls in March — significantly below the 2021 recall vote, which reached 58 percent.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6337590054112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Turnout in this year’s primary was also 3.4 percentage points lower than in 2020’s, when there was a competitive Democratic presidential contest on the ballot. A similar measure, a school funding bond backed by Newsom, struggled that March even with slightly higher turnout: The measure failed, winning just 47 percent of the vote.</p><p>The results of both the 2020 school bond and this year’s Prop 1 indicate how difficult it is for a state-level politician like Newsom to shape the electorate in a significant way when he himself isn’t on the ballot, said Paul Mitchell, vice president of Political Data Inc., a commercial provider of voter data to campaigns and others.</p><p>“When you’re on the ballot, you can drive turnout because people are upset or excited” about your candidacy, Mitchell said. “But on a ballot measure, to try to drive turnout would be really hard.”</p><p>The March electorate was likely shaped more by the partisan primaries with which it shared a ballot. Republicans faced an active presidential nominating contest between Donald Trump and Nikki Haley, while on the Democratic side President Joe Biden did little to mobilize voters in his noncompetitive race. (In fact, fewer people voted overall in the Democratic presidential primary than voted for Prop 1). In the Senate primary, Democratic Rep.

While Newsom’s team prioritized elite outreach, enlisting a broad coalition of both labor and business interests and trumpeting endorsements from Republican legislators, the results suggest it failed to successfully sell the technically complex proposal to voters.</p><p>Newsom’s own stature among the electorate may have also had an impact on the vote.

It’s a particular benefit to smaller cities, which unlike Los Angeles or San Francisco, don’t have the resources to lobby alone in the capital.</p><p>"I do think that opting out, in some ways, diminishes your clout," San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan said. "You're better off advocating and organizing from within to sort of shape the positions that organization takes, because we have a lot in common as cities."</p><p>But a growing number of cities, many in Orange County, are giving up their membership in protest, saying the group no longer represents their interests or advocates for them.</p><p>Yorba Linda, along with Orange, had already paid its membership dues for the year, CalCities said, but Mayor Pro Tem Beth Haney, who led the departure, said the council no longer considers itself part of the league.</p><p>"It is sending a message — along with the other cities that are disappointed," she said.</p><p>Similar complaints came out of Santa Clarita, Redondo Beach and Torrance last year. The cities left the organization after complaining that the group had failed to support local control measures around land use. Redondo Beach and Torrance later rejoined.</p><p>Coleman said CalCities has a process to develop policies that is “extremely inclusive” — starting with committees focused on specific topics that make recommendations to the board.</p><p>"Not everyone, all the time, will get every single issue or position that they would want if they were individuals,” she said.</p><p>Some conservative council members, like Erik Weigand in Newport Beach, voted to stay in the league, arguing some representation is better than none at all. But in an interview, Weigand said he shares his colleagues’ concerns and hopes the departure is a wakeup call.</p><p>"Maybe it will make the league pay attention, and make the league recognize that cities are frustrated that they're not listening to them,” he said.</p><p>There are other avenues for representation for those looking for alternatives — including the Association of California Cities - Orange County — but they don’t have the same reach as CalCities, Weigand noted.</p><p>Coleman, the head of the league, said they are still engaging with the recently-departed members and hope to bring them back in the future.</p><p>But for those like Haney, they don’t see a path to reconciliation at this time.</p><p>"Next year, it's highly likely that we will not rejoin," she said.</p><p><i>Julia Marsh contributed to this report.</i></p><p><i>Like this content?

Bush Presidential Center, Burns urged lawmakers to pass the supplemental that would dedicate billions to Ukraine’s war efforts.</p><p>“With the boost that would come from military assistance, both practically and psychologically, Ukrainians are entirely capable of holding their own through 2024 and puncturing Putin’s arrogant view that time is on his side,” he said.</p><p>But if that doesn’t make it through Congress, “the picture is a lot more dire,” he continued. “There is a very real risk that the Ukrainians could lose on the battlefield by the end of 2024, or at least put Putin in a position where he could essentially dictate the terms of a political settlement.”<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350643815112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>It’s perhaps the strongest warning from a senior administration official yet regarding the war, coming as <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2024/04/17/ukraine-on-edge-of-defeat-as-it-waits-for-aid-00152869" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;officials in Kyiv warn&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2024/04/17/ukraine-on-edge-of-defeat-as-it-waits-for-aid-00152869&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8da90002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8da90003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">officials in Kyiv warn</a> that a looming Russian offensive in the summer — which would see massive waves of troops invading Ukraine — could overwhelm Kyiv’s struggling soldiers.</p><p>Burns’ remarks come a day after House Speaker<a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" target="_blank" data-person-id="242539" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1713466807100,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f766-d6b4-a7e5-f7ee71fe0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1713466807100,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f766-d6b4-a7e5-f7ee71fe0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;242539\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Rep.

Trump had urged Mehta to sideline the lawsuits in part because he argued that disclosing details about his claim of presidential immunity could undermine his criminal defense.</p><p>But Mehta rejected that argument.<br /></p><br /><p>“[B]oth cases center on the former President’s actions in the lead up to and on January 6, 2021,” Metha agreed. “But Defendant overstates the significance of that factual overlap in the present posture of these matters.”</p><p>Trump has used his claim of presidential immunity as a shield from both criminal charges and lawsuits related to his actions in the chaotic weeks leading up to Jan. 6, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol. The Supreme Court will hear arguments next week on the immunity issue in the criminal case.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351053834112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Mehta, however, said questions about Trump’s immunity in the context of his lawsuits can be addressed without requiring him to admit to any particular actions he took on Jan. 6 — from the drafting of his speech at the Ellipse that day to his tweets and public commentary — that might also be relevant to his criminal case.</p><p>Only one category of evidence in the civil case might implicate Trump’s Fifth Amendment rights, Mehta continued: his tweets from Jan. 6. But Mehta said he will not require Trump to admit whether he drafted any particular tweet, alleviating the concern that he might be forced to admit to conduct that could incriminate him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This is the one I want , Safety , Drywall , and Security [sic],” Riza wrote in an email, according to the complaint. “One project but we all can eat ! Please show to him before Event it will start when he's in office."</p><p>Riza, along with two other defendants, has donated to several prominent political figures in the neighborhood over the years.</p><p>Thursday's deal was hashed out between Riza and the office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought charges against six people over the summer alleging they steered tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars to the mayor’s campaign in the form of public matching funds.

That 8 percentage point margin is much smaller than at this point in the 2020 election. At that time, Biden was leading Trump by 23 percentage points among young people.</p><p>Biden’s margins widen when the pool is restricted to registered and likely voters. But, still, his 19-point lead over Trump among the voters under 30 who are considered likely to turn out is significantly smaller than his 30-point advantage this time four years ago.</p><p>Biden holds wide leads among likely voters who are non-white and women — up by 43 points and 33 points over Trump, respectively. He trounces Trump among the higher-educated set, leading the presumptive Republican nominee by 47 points among likely voters who are college graduates and 23 points among college students.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351100473112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>But Biden’s margins are far slimmer — or nonexistent — among other key demographics. He’s just 6 percentage points ahead of Trump among likely voters who are young men, according to the poll, and just 3 points ahead among white voters. When it comes to young people without college degrees, Biden and Trump are in a dead heat.</p><p>And though there are fewer of them, Trump’s younger voters are far more enthusiastic about the former president than their peers who are backing Biden, according to the poll. More than three-quarters of Trump voters said they enthusiastically support the Republican, while just 44 percent of Biden voters said the same.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/a2/a9/795a34814047993d209a27790410/election-2024-trump-55155.jpg" /><br /><p>The nationwide survey of 2,010 Americans aged 18 to 29 was conducted between March 14 and 21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Respondents were surveyed online after being randomly recruited to join a panel maintained by Ipsos Public Affairs.</p><p>“Make no mistake, this is a different youth electorate than we saw in 2020 and 2022, and young voters are motivated by different things,” John Della Volpe, polling director for the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics and an expert on polling young voters, said in a statement.</p><p>“Economic issues are top of mind, housing is a major concern — and the gap between young men's and young women's political preferences is pronounced,” he said.</p><p>The Harvard youth survey <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/07/voter-age-biden-trump-2024-election-00150923" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;is the latest to show Trump rising among the nation’s youngest voters&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/07/voter-age-biden-trump-2024-election-00150923&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db20000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">is the latest to show Trump rising among the nation’s youngest voters</a>, another potential warning sign for Democrats whose presidential candidates have long been able to successfully court that bloc.</p><p>Indeed, while Biden’s lead is 26 points among likely voters ages 25 to 29, it falls to 14 points among those ages 18 to 24.</p><p>Still, the survey shows some reasons for concern for Trump, too. Biden’s overall lead grows if the former president is convicted in any of his criminal trials, with the Democrat jumping up 10 points among all young adults, 8 points among registered voters and 9 points among likely voters.</p><p>But third-party candidates threaten to erode Biden’s margins, putting more data behind a scenario Democrats have long feared. Biden would still win the youth vote with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West and Jill Stein on the ballot, the Harvard pollsters said, but potentially only by a handful of points.</p><p>And Biden’s job approval rating among younger adults is just 31 percent.</p><p>Meanwhile, Biden’s approach to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war could cost him at the ballot box. More than half of young adults, 51 percent, support a permanent cease-fire in Gaza — which Biden has stopped short of calling for — a viewpoint that cuts across party and demographic lines. Just 10 percent of young people oppose it.</p><p>Just a fifth of young Americans believe Israel’s response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 incursion is justified, while 32 percent believe it is not.</p>]]></content:encoded>

J.D. Vance partially to blame.</p><p>Last week, the Ohio Republican authored a New York Times op-ed headlined “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/12/opinion/jd-vance-ukraine.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;The Math on Ukraine Doesn’t Add Up&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/12/opinion/jd-vance-ukraine.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db70004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db70005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">The Math on Ukraine Doesn’t Add Up</a>,” and he’s followed that up by <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/04/17/congress/vance-00152828" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;meeting with&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/04/17/congress/vance-00152828&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db70006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db70007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">meeting with</a> the House’s Republican Study Committee on Wednesday to whip against Johnson’s Ukraine bill.</p><p>Earlier this year I spent months speaking to Vance for an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/15/mr-maga-goes-to-washington-00147054" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;extensive profile&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/15/mr-maga-goes-to-washington-00147054&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db70008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db70009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">extensive profile</a> exploring how the freshman Republican has become Donald Trump’s most loyal ally in the Senate, while also laying the groundwork for an even more expansive and radical vision of the “America First” worldview. During my hours of talking with Vance, he defended his persistent opposition to U.S. aid to Ukraine, which he — even more so than Trump — has elevated as a signature issue since entering the Senate last year.</p><p>Yet that opposition also emerged as one small part of Vance’s much broader — and more sweeping — theory of international affairs. If Vance gets his way, cutting off U.S. funding to Ukraine will be only the first step in a much broader reorientation of the U.S.’s role in the global order.<br /></p><br /><p>Vance is deeply skeptical of the so-called rules-based international order — the system of laws, norms and multilateral institutions established in the years following the Second World War to mitigate global conflict and facilitate international economic activity. As Vance sees it, this system has enriched economic elites while harming working-class people who are rooted in older industrial economies — all while failing to deliver on the ultimate goal of liberalizing non-democratic countries like China and Russia.</p><p>From this perspective, Vance does not see the United States’ decision to defend <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3265802/secretary-of-state-antony-j-blinken-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iii-jap/#:~:text=We%20stand%20together%20with%20Ukraine,independence%2C%20their%20territorial%20integrity%20respected." target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;“the principles at the heart of the international rules-based order”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3265802/secretary-of-state-antony-j-blinken-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iii-jap/#:~:text=We%20stand%20together%20with%20Ukraine,independence%2C%20their%20territorial%20integrity%20respected.&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db7000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db7000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">“the principles at the heart of the international rules-based order”</a> in Ukraine as part of some high-minded and honorable policy. Instead, Vance sees it as a self-interested effort by economic elites to preserve a global order that advanced their interests while screwing over the type of people he represents in post-industrial Ohio.</p><p>As he once put it to me, “I think you have to rethink the entire project.”</p><br /><p><br /><b>In place of the rules-based</b> international order, Vance thinks the U.S. needs to chart a new, more nationalistic system where individual nations are solely responsible for their own security and economic well-being, and more insulated from global economic and military entanglements. According to Vance, the first step toward nudging the world in that direction is ending U.S. aid to Ukraine — which, as became clear this week, depends on convincing his Republican colleagues in the House to kill Johnson’s foreign aid package.</p><p>Vance has marshaled several different arguments against additional U.S. aid to Ukraine, prompting his opponents in both parties to argue that he’s <a href="https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-if-your-position-is-being-cheered-by-vladimir-putin-its-time-to-reconsider-your-position/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;merely carrying water&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-if-your-position-is-being-cheered-by-vladimir-putin-its-time-to-reconsider-your-position/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db80001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">merely carrying water</a> for Vladimir Putin and other authoritarian leaders. (Vance has, of course, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/sen-jd-vance-tells-jake-000323078.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;pushed back&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/news/sen-jd-vance-tells-jake-000323078.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db80002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db80003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">pushed back</a> against this characterization.)</p><p>When it comes to the specifics of the Ukraine bill, Vance has been pushing three main objections. In his New York Times op-ed last week, Vance argued that the current aid package — which would provide an additional $60 billion to Ukraine — would do little to shift the war in Ukraine’s favor. (Supporters of the current aid package have <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/courage-strength-optimism/2966259/backing-ukraine-help-not-hurt-us-deterrence/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;challenged this claim&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/courage-strength-optimism/2966259/backing-ukraine-help-not-hurt-us-deterrence/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db80004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db80005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">challenged this claim</a>.) Vance also argues that the U.S. lacks the manufacturing capacity to produce the volume of weapons that Ukraine would need to win the war.</p><p>His last, and most explicitly partisan, objection stems from his preparations for Trump’s possible return to the White House next year. Vance has objected to a component of Johnson’s aid package — which proposes seizing Russian assets under the REPO Act and freezing the current sanction regime against Russia in place — on the grounds that it would <a href="https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/vance-memo-warns-repo-act-could-pose-dire-consequences-for-the-western-financial-system/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;tie a second-term Trump’s hands&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/vance-memo-warns-repo-act-could-pose-dire-consequences-for-the-western-financial-system/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db80006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db80007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">tie a second-term Trump’s hands</a> in his negotiations with Russia. This isn’t the first time that Vance has objected to Ukraine aid by invoking Trump, either. In February, when the Senate was debating its own version of the aid package, Vance told his colleagues that locking spending levels in place <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/02/12/congress/vance-foreign-aid-bill-could-get-trump-impeached-00140939" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;could create a hidden mechanism&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/02/12/congress/vance-foreign-aid-bill-could-get-trump-impeached-00140939&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db80008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8db80009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">could create a hidden mechanism</a> for Democrats to impeach Trump in his second term.</p><p>Yet Vance’s efforts this week to persuade his Republican colleagues in the House of these specific objections are, in many respects, secondary to his broader goal of shifting the Republican paradigm on foreign policy. As Vance explained to me during our conversations, this larger project goes beyond injecting some “realism” — or, as his critics would call it, “isolationism” — into the foreign policy debates on the right. In a more expansive sense, Vance sees the debate over Ukraine aid as a proxy for the debate over the direction of what he openly calls “the American empire” — and, by extension, of America as a whole.</p><p>“The really interesting debate that is happening between the establishment right and the populist right is [about] challenging the premise … that things are going really well,” Vance told me. On the one side, establishment Republicans believe that the American empire is trending in the right direction; populist Republicans believe that the American empire is on the verge of collapse. The establishment points to falling poverty rates around the world; the populist right points to falling birth and life expectancies at home.</p><p>“There’s just this desperate effort to just argue that everything’s gone well,” Vance told me, “and, man, I just don’t buy it at all.”<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

You can’t pack a theater so full of people that no one can reach the fire exits without being trampled. In the physical world, these kinds of noise control and fire safety regulations uneventfully coexist with our First Amendment free speech and free assembly rights. They’re accepted as common-sense ways to keep us safe and preserve our sanity.</p><p>The same ideas can be applied to social media. By reverse engineering the noise and lack of crowd control that has overrun social media platforms, we can make the internet a more peaceful, reliable, less polarizing place.</p><p>And we can do it without the government policing speech. In fact, Congress does not have to do anything. It doesn’t even need to touch Section 230, the now infamous 1996 law that gives social media platforms immunity for the harmful content — from healthcare hoaxes to election misinformation to Russian and Chinese state-sponsored propaganda — that has created a world of chaos and division, where so many people don’t believe even the most basic truths. Instead, <i>the Federal Trade Commission and other consumer protection regulators around the world could enforce the contracts the platforms already have with their users.</i></p><p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, already promises users that it will enforce “community standards” that prohibit, among other abuses: inciting violence, “inauthentic” behavior such as setting up fake accounts, promoting suicide, bullying, hate speech, graphic or sexually explicit content, human exploitation and misinformation “that will cause imminent physical harm, health-care misinformation and misinformation about elections and voting.”</p><p>This list could more accurately describe all the categories of harmful content that have flourished on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>Most of the other platforms have similar lists of prohibited content and contracts with their users. These terms of service do not say, “We take our role seriously, but our algorithms encourage a lot of that content, and the volume of it flowing through our platform makes it impossible to prevent much of it from being posted even if we wanted to. Sorry.” Yet that’s basically what they say whenever they embark on another session of their yearslong apology tours testifying in front of Congress and similar tribunals around the world.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6345958140112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>The FTC is responsible for protecting consumers, including by suing companies that defraud them by violating the terms of a contract. Section 5 of the law creating the FTC declares that “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce … are … unlawful,” and empowers the commission to prevent companies from using such deceptive practices. The commission’s Policy Statement on Deception defines “deceptive” practices as a material “representation, omission or practice that is likely to mislead a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances.” In fact, the FTC has already taken action against Facebook for violating the privacy promises it makes in those same terms of service. It imposed a $5 billion fine in 2020.</p><p>The FTC’s website explains that “the Commission may use rulemaking to address unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition that occur commonly, in lieu of relying solely on actions against individual respondents.” Accordingly, the commission could enforce the content promises in these terms of service by promulgating a rule that any digital platform must prominently and clearly spell out in its terms of service what content it will allow and not allow — and then, as with their privacy assurances, make sure they keep those promises.</p><p>Spelling out those terms prominently and clearly would mean posting a large chart on a prominent screen listing all possible offending content and requiring the platform to check a box if the content is prohibited or allowed.</p><p>In keeping with First Amendment restrictions on government regulation of the content of speech, it would be up to the platforms to decide which content to prohibit — that is, to check or not check each box. A platform that wants to allow misinformation or hate speech could choose to do so. However, it would have to level with its users in that prominent chart by declaring that it is choosing to allow it. This would give a stricter platform a competitive advantage in the marketplace; a platform that has to declare in large print that it allows misinformation or hate speech is likely to turn off many potential users and advertisers.</p><p>First Amendment protections would prohibit the government from forcing the platforms to prohibit hate speech or most misinformation. Yet nothing stops the proprietors of a platform from making those decisions by defining what it considers hate speech or harmful misinformation and screening it out. That’s called editing, which is protected by the First Amendment when private parties, not the government, do it. In fact, editing is what the authors of Section 230 had in mind when they wrote it; it shielded platforms from liability not only for what they <i>do</i> allow but also for what they do <i>not</i> allow. This is why the provision was titled the “Protection for ‘Good Samaritans’ Act.” Let’s make those who run the platforms be Good Samaritans.<br /></p><br /><p>This would be a logical and content-neutral way for the commission “to address deceptive practices” — in this case an obvious and widespread failure by the platforms to deliver on the promises made in their contracts with users. The FTC rule would require that the platforms prove that their declarations about what content they will not allow are real — not aspirational. As with inspectors checking enforcement of building codes, making sure there is adequate exit access in a crowded theater or catering hall, the FTC rule should require that each platform demonstrate that it has the capability to screen the volume of its content<i>.</i></p><p>If this means that a platform has to cut its profit margins to hire thousands of people to screen all content before it is posted, or that it has to drastically lower the volume of users or the amount of content that they can post, so be it.</p><p>We should have learned by now that the ability for anyone anywhere to send any kind of video or text message instantly to everyone anywhere may be a technology marvel, but it is anything but a positive development. A quieter, less spontaneous online community is superior to the alternative of people live-streaming a murder, summoning rioters to the Capitol or, as happened in the days following the Hamas attack on Israel, Facebook, X and TikTok posting hundreds of lurid videos — quickly receiving millions of views worldwide — of the terrorists celebrating as they committed unspeakable atrocities.</p><p>The promises from the Silicon Valley witnesses at these now routine congressional hearings to work harder and do better are meaningless because they do not manage the volume and velocity of what gets posted. Instead, they apologize for being overwhelmed by the fire hose of content that is the essence of their business model — and the controllable but uncontrolled source of their bonanza profits.</p><p>To enforce this capability requirement, the FTC would have independent auditors review the platforms’ content on a regular basis to determine whether they have proved capable of keeping their promises. The audits should be publicly available. And if the audits demonstrate that a platform’s promises are not being kept, fines or even an order to suspend service would follow.</p><p>The FTC has the regulatory authority to proceed on its own without Congress to enforce the platforms’ own contractual promises. And you can encourage the commissioners to do just that. The FTC website invites consumers to report fraud. Although this is clearly meant for specific complaints about some online scam or unwelcome robo-call, if you think your social media company is not keeping its promises about preventing harmful content, <a href="https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1713446577580,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-f8ec-dab7-a5ff-fced2e9d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1713446577580,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-f8ec-dab7-a5ff-fced2e9d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f15f-d1c7-a3ef-fbdfd7060001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;you can report them&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f15f-d1c7-a3ef-fbdfd7060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">you can report them</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kennedy and Robert Kennedy and speechwriter extraordinaire to Lyndon B. Johnson. Although he was only in his 20s and 30s at the time, Dick Goodwin was author of some of the most memorable speeches in American history, inventing phrases that came to define the era, from the “Alliance for Progress” to the “Great Society.”</p><p>That history is part of the tale Goodwin tells in her new book, <i>An Unfinished Love Story: A Personal History of the 1960s</i>. The book is based on files she pored through with her late husband in the final years of his life, and it weaves his experiences together with her own. As a young PhD candidate at Harvard, Goodwin worked in the White House under Johnson. It was the height of the tumultuous 1960s and she almost lost her White House job during Vietnam by co-authoring an article titled, “How to Remove LBJ.” Worried about how he’d be seen by history, Johnson later asked Goodwin to help write his memoirs, launching her career as a presidential historian.</p><p>I talked to Doris Goodwin this week about the book. We covered everything from life inside the Kennedy and Johnson White Houses to the strange tale of RFK Jr., to the advice she gave Biden.</p><p><i>The following has been edited for length and clarity.</i><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/bd/e7/8e6a35a74f72a2747ef583f079c1/mag-hirsch-kearnsgoodwinqa-couple.jpg" /><br /><p><b>You say this book means more to you than anything you’ve ever written. Obviously, that has a lot to do with working on it with your late husband, Richard Goodwin, but is it also because of the extraordinary history you two lived through together in the 1960s, even though you didn’t meet until the decade was over?</b></p><p>That was really the great adventure of our lives: to relive the decade that meant so much to us, from beginning to middle to end, [while] trying to suspend our knowledge of how it ended, with the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy and the riots, and the antiwar violence in the campuses. In his last years it gave Dick a sense of purpose and joy to be waking up knowing we’d be working on this, and also allowed him to soften his feelings for LBJ, whom he had once loved and turned against because of the war. And somehow putting those resentments aside and remembering the heyday of the Great Society, was really important to him. The great thing working on the archive with him was that usually my presidents are dead and they never talk back to me. This time [the subject] was right across from me.</p><p><b>You and Dick were happily married for 42 years. But as the two of you dove into his trove of White House files you started having some serious fights about all that history. After John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Dick’s files revealed how fiercely JFK’s anguished brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, hated LBJ. RFK even suggested at one point that LBJ — the president who would later author so many Great Society programs to address poverty and racial injustice — had “no feeling for people who were hungry.” You were outraged by that, you said.&#xa0;</b></p><p>It really was upsetting. I was such a Johnson loyalist and he [Dick] was a Kennedy loyalist. … I eventually came to feel a great respect and appreciation for Bobby Kennedy but the idea that Johnson didn’t care about people who were hungry and had no empathy for them was just so wrong-headed. It was said that when JFK was killed and LBJ came into the presidency, Bobby couldn’t bear looking at him because it was a reminder that his brother wasn’t there. He didn’t go to Cabinet meetings. And then I began to understand a little more that conversation Dick had with him, when he was so sad and all those [Great Society] laws were passing, and Bobby said, “It’s just not fair. My brother had only three years.” Dick says to him, “Yeah, but Julius Caesar had only three years, and he’s remembered by history,” and Bobby comes back with, “Yeah, but it’s good to have Shakespeare write about you.” Bobby was funny.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/4e/9c/5bb4d412484c92cc50e025400acd/mag-hirsch-kearnsgoodwinqa-60s-grid.jpg" /><br /><p><b>And then of course a few years later Bobby is also assassinated, and his own family of 11 children is deeply traumatized. Several of those children go on to have troubled lives. One of these kids was Bobby’s second-oldest son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who’s become a conspiracy theorist and often seems to suggest that the political system is rigged against him.&#xa0;RFK Jr.’s decision to run against Biden is obviously something of a puzzle to his own family. You’ve written a lot about the Kennedys. Can you give us any insight into his character, where that psychology comes from?</b></p><p>I really wish I knew. I knew him when he was younger. I don’t know whether it’s psychology from the past or what he’s gone through. … All you can do is judge what he’s standing for. There’s a certain kind of anti-science approach, but his father loved learning and had a curiosity about science and literature. There was a sense of a broadening mind that his father stood for that is different from what young Robert Kennedy is standing for. It surprises me and perplexes me.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/69/86/b87d73014bcf901ff4eb93c8c183/mag-hirsch-kearnsgoodwinqa-selma.jpg" /><br /><p><b>The Biden campaign is in something of a state of some confusion right now. The president believes he’s not getting enough credit for his achievements. Have you advised Biden on this?</b></p><p>I just saw him at the beginning of his presidency. I remember talking to him about [Franklin Roosevelt’s] fireside chats, that it was a mode of communication that would fit his conversational style of speaking. And we talked about FDR and the Great Depression and all the laws that went on the books at that time. You could see he was thinking in those terms.</p><p><b>Did you give him any other advice?</b></p><p>He was just starting the presidency, so I really just gave him some advice on communication — that FDR adopted a means of communication that was different from JFK’s more soaring rhetoric. I really think that Biden and LBJ spoke more like FDR, who had a rule that he didn’t want words of more than one syllable if possible. He understood he was talking directly to the people.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/b6/69/206c94b74fb3b39cdf017f3d51ec/mag-hirsch-kearnsgoodwinqa-speech.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Perhaps one of Biden’s problems is that he doesn’t have a Richard Goodwin writing for him.</b></p><p>The funniest moment I think is when [presidential aide] Bill Moyers and LBJ are talking in the spring of ’64, and Johnson says, I need someone who is going to put sex and rhythm and music and great Churchillian phrases into my speeches [after which Goodwin was hired]. But great speeches depend not simply on the words but also on the moment in which they’re spoken. If Patrick Henry had said “Give me liberty or give me death” in the middle of a Chamber of Commerce meeting people would have thought it ludicrous, right? Great events allow somebody to rise to the occasion. Yet it’s also different today when you don’t have everybody listening to the speech in the same way and the pundits are talking about the speech even before it’s finished.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/b7/e5/c1d3c0554da19049b8b685747722/mag-hirsch-kearnsgoodwinqa-civilwar.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Your husband remarks at one point in the book that people have a grim view of the Johnson era today — with the Vietnam war, the assassinations of King and the Kennedys and the violence in the streets — but that what they miss is the exhilaration and sense of hope.</b></p><p>One of things I really hope is the book makes this younger generation feel there once was a time when young people really led the nation, when you think about those who joined the Peace Corps, who were marching against segregation and for the right to vote, the Freedom Riders, the sit-ins and the demonstrations, the beginnings of the women’s and gay rights movements. There was a belief they could make a difference. There was a sense that they wanted to be part of something larger than themselves. It’s a great feeling. It’s what I felt when I went to the March on Washington in August 1963.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/8d/9f/89b0f6c24c6882cda8cfd332f073/mag-hirsch-kearnsgoodwinqa-book.jpg" /><br /><p><b>&#xa0;You’ve said that if you had one issue you’d want to fight for today it would be voting rights. Nearly 60 years ago it was your husband who wrote the famous “We Shall Overcome” speech that set the stage for the Voting Rights Act of 1965. And yet here we are again, still fighting politically over this issue.</b></p><p>I know. The long view of history tells you that progress is a relay race. If you think about the 50s, it starts in some ways with Emmett Till’s mother, who wants people to see what was done to her son. So that then fires up Rosa Parks who’s sitting on the bus and thinks maybe she won’t go through with this — but then she remembers Emmett Till’s mother. So Rosa Parks stays there, goes to jail, and that brings on the Montgomery bus boycott. And then Martin Luther King becomes the leader of that, and so begin the sit-ins against segregation and the Freedom Rides. And it takes until 1964, after Birmingham and civil rights and LBJ coming into office, to get that filibuster broken. And yet that moment happens.</p><p>And now we see the slow diminution of that. It’s heartbreaking that it’s a fight that has to be fought again. LBJ said voting is the central right on which all other rights depend. [But] there are times in our country’s history where you go backward — and you have to catch up again and then move forward.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/0c/0c/b09850104086bcc1a34fe788822d/mag-hirsch-kearnsgoodwinqa-kennedys.jpg" /><br /><p><b>One of your husband’s extraordinary last acts of public service was to write Al Gore’s concession speech in 2000. In what was praised as a moment of eloquence and grace, Gore said that, while he strongly disagreed with the Supreme Court’s decision giving the election to George W. Bush, he was conceding “for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy.”&#xa0;If Dick had to write such a speech for the loser in 2024, what do you think would he write?</b></p><p>I hope he would write almost the same thing — which is this election has been fairly won or lost. These elections are so guarded that anyone talking about 2020 says it was probably the most secure election in history. Gore quoted the saying inscribed over the Harvard Law School library. [Ed: “Not under man but under God and law.”] That’s what every other person has done in our history. They thought they would have made a difference in the direction of the country and yet one after another after another has come out and made those statements.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/b8/cd/ad933a9140c9b584dbc365cc0277/mag-hirsch-kearnsgoodwinqa-wedding.jpg" /><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

Let’s not kid ourselves. He was docked a week’s pay for his message, not his conduct. If Berliner had, say, written a poem for the <i>New Yorker</i>, or reviewed a book for the <i>Washington Post </i>without first getting a sign-off from NPR, he might have gotten congratulations from his bosses or at the very worst, a polite scolding for not following the rules. Berliner’s real “crime” is that he trashed his own institution in public, and did it loudly, and when you do that in most places of employment, a sharp reprimand is sure to follow.</p> <p>Editors have, of course, been contending with increasingly contentious staffers over the past decades who take their grievances public. Social media has proved a powerful amplifier of their beefs.</p><p><br />Some observers might think the Berliner reprimand shows that fed up bosses are finally starting to crack down on rowdy employees. But that’s too generous of an interpretation. Berliner could have dumped bilge on NPR and still gotten a clean getaway if he had indemnified himself by bringing a posse of similar malcontents with him, as this <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/28/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc-newsroom-power-shift-00149408" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;previous column&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/28/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc-newsroom-power-shift-00149408&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dc7000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dc7000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">previous column</a> demonstrates.</p><p>When Chuck Todd ripped NBC News for having hired Ronna McDaniel as a paid commentator, he took his case to an NBC News show, <i>Meet the Press</i>, indicating that he had buy-in from other NBCers. Indeed he did, as they vocally seconded his protest of the hiring.</p><p>Another way to bring your posse with you is to launch your rebellion on your outlet’s internal Slack account. Newsroom staffers are natural complainers and fault-finders. That’s one of the reasons they chose the profession in the first place. If you assemble a newsroom of journalists, you can confidently predict an altercation unless you’ve got a lion tamer on retainer. It also benefits a protester to bring to the revolt an identarian complaint that includes race, sexual orientation, religion or gender. Bosses get wiggy when forced to parse an identity-based complaint. Unfortunately for Berliner, he couldn’t take that route.</p><p>We have learned in recent years that when staffers start shouting at the bosses on Slack or in a petition, the bosses squirm. It happened at POLITICO after bosses gave <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/politico-ben-shapiro_n_60009e8dc5b6efae62f6f2f7" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Ben Shapiro an assignment&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/politico-ben-shapiro_n_60009e8dc5b6efae62f6f2f7&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dc7000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dc7000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Ben Shapiro an assignment</a>; it happened at the <i>New York Times </i>after it published <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/5/21280425/new-york-times-tom-cotton-send-troops-staff-revolt" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Sen.

Coordinated Slack and social media posts on X give staffers new-found leverage in their tussles with management. How can you beat down a newsroom when everybody holding down a desk is shouting, “I am Spartacus”? It’s impractical to crucify your entire staff.</p><p>If Berliner had dropped his bomb after organizing like-minded colleagues at NPR to support him — or even enlisted a gaggle after publishing the broadside against his network — he would have remained untouchable. Bosses everywhere are good at admonishing individuals. But they wilt against numbers.</p><p>Perhaps Berliner didn’t assemble a posse because support for his anti-NPR views, so publicly visible and voluble on the outside, is not common inside the broadcaster, even though Berliner told NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo that he has “<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/16/media/npr-suspends-editor-uri-berliner-who-called-out-left-wing-bias/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a lot of support&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nypost.com/2024/04/16/media/npr-suspends-editor-uri-berliner-who-called-out-left-wing-bias/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dc70012&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dc70013&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a lot of support</a>” inside the newsroom. It’s likely that Berliner thought the best way to achieve maximum impact for his anti-NPR diatribe would be to intentionally draw an official rebuke from the network and thereby become a martyr and then resign in protest. It doesn’t require a Ph.D. in game theory to see that Berliner, who was <a href="https://findingaids.smith.edu/repositories/2/resources/1123" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;born in 1956&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://findingaids.smith.edu/repositories/2/resources/1123&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dc70014&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dc70015&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">born in 1956</a> and now qualifies for Medicare, got what he wanted. Surely a book contract and speaking engagements will follow.</p><p>Most of Berliner’s complaints about how progressive groupthink has tarnished NPR track well under scrutiny. What does not is his observation that only “in recent years” has the network stopped resembling “America at large.” Even a casual NPR listener knows that what Berliner says about NPR has been true for at least 40 years, and surely for the 25 years he has worked there. NPR knows its listeners’ preconceptions well, and has indulged them for a long time. What took Berliner so long to discover the self-evident?</p><p>Steve Oney, whose history of NPR, <i>On Air</i>, comes out next year, says in an interview that the network has never been good at managing its own press.</p><p> <br /></p><br /><p><br />“They think they’re small time when in fact they’re big time,’ he says, and it shows whenever the network finds itself in the news.

He also compares the current dustup to one in the 1970s, when consultants were brought in from Antioch College to assist the network in shaping its coverage in a direction consistent with today’s social justice proponents. The staff successfully rebelled in a Berliner-like manner, he says.</p><p>“In the end they gave one guy a three-day suspension,” Oney says, and a new chief, Frank Mankiewicz was brought in to professionalize the network toward the mainstream and away from its collegiate-quality coverage.</p><p>While bosses can be timid and ham-fisted about personnel matters, they’re not uniformly stupid.</p><p>A two-year-old piece in <a href="https://thefineprintnyc.com/article/new-york-times-slack/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;The Fine Print&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thefineprintnyc.com/article/new-york-times-slack/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dc80004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dc80005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">The Fine Print</a> reports that the <i>New York Times </i>nullified the employees’ Slack advantage by making some channels read-only and otherwise limited online interaction, shifting potential dissent to company-run sessions where it can be more easily shut down.

Roh Moo-hyun, from the liberal party, died of suicide while he and his close circle were investigated for bribery. Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye were convicted and sentenced to prison over bribery and abuse of power. Yoon Suk Yeol, the current president of South Korea, played a key role in the indictment of Park Geun-hye as prosecutor general at the time, and his achievement catapulted him to the stardom he needed to run for the presidency.</p><p>With the U.S. now facing its first criminal trial of a former president, I called up Nathan Park, a fellow at the foreign-policy focused <a href="https://quincyinst.org/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1713301995071,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82d4-d747-a9be-ced69b5e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1713301995071,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82d4-d747-a9be-ced69b5e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://quincyinst.org/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-e8c1-d3bc-adfe-f8edad4a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Quincy Institute&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-e8c1-d3bc-adfe-f8edad4a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Quincy Institute</a> and a left-leaning Korea watcher, to ask how the U.S. can learn from Korea’s long history of locking up past leaders. Park, who is critical of the current Yoon administration, discussed the consequences of prosecuting leaders, how to prevent it from becoming a political weapon and why a future president should consider pardoning Trump if he does get convicted.<br /></p><br /><p>Once lauded as victories for democracy over corruption, the prosecutions have now thrust Korea into a new and paranoid era, with government officials riddled with fears of lawsuits and criminal charges. Even worse, it makes lawmakers afraid to admit fault for fear of their apologies being used against them in court.</p><p>“On a very ground level … you can sense it from government officials that they’re freaking terrified to do anything outside of the manual,” Park says. “Everything they do is extremely defensive.”</p><p><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p><p><b>Park Geun-hye’s impeachment and conviction was seen as a democratic win at the time — but now it seems like we’re stuck in a loop of non-stop prosecution of the opposition party. What have the political implications been like since her sentencing?</b></p><p>What happened afterward is pretty unique and pretty wild. What it did was it legalized politics. Not legalized as in going from illegal to legal, but legalized as in politics became sort of lawfare. It became more about, Did you break the law? Did you not? Can you prove this in court? Can you not? And the people who are the most powerful in this lawfare are the prosecutors. What ended up happening is that the Prosecutor General — Yoon Suk Yeol — the most powerful prosecutor of them all, became the president on the strength of that. He became a political star first by prosecuting Park Geun-hye.</p><p>On a very ground level, I have been feeling — just because I do a lot of work and business in Korea — you can sense it from government officials that they’re freaking terrified to do anything outside of the manual, and everything they do is extremely defensive. Korean government used to be a very, very efficient thing relative to other governments. Now it’s still more efficient than other governments, but you can feel that the gears are slowing down a little and a lot of it is the fact that even minor officials are completely terrified of doing something that is outside of the manual and potentially prosecuted for some reason or another.</p><p>The other thing that happened is that Yoon Suk Yeol is also afraid of the same thing happening to him. So the other side of the coin is that you end up having an administration that never compromises and never admits any fault. And I think you really see that in the aftermath of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/30/world/asia/south-korea-itaewon-crowd-crush-victims.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Itaweon disaster&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/30/world/asia/south-korea-itaewon-crowd-crush-victims.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dcd0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dcd0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Itaweon disaster</a>, which was this really unbelievably awful thing. And what happens is nobody apologizes, nobody resigns. They just generically say that, “Oh, we’re sorry this happened.” This is all sort of like the litigious mindset where the moment you admit fault you feel like you’re exposing yourself to a potential liability.</p><p><b>Is that because once you do expose yourself to liability, people will try to prosecute you and use that against you in court?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Yeah, because now, instead of normal politics, the expectation is that everything will be reduced to a lawsuit and indictment. So in that sense, one could argue that prosecuting leaders was a negative.</p><p><b>Do you think that politicians see prosecution as an opportunity now? Do they see the prosecution of a president as an opportunity to gain strength?</b></p><p>Oh, absolutely. In Yoon’s case, it was absolutely the direct motivation. He leveraged these prosecutions to become a political star himself.</p><p>I have a hard time imagining that this could happen in the U.S., just because of the way our justice system is structured. But imagine someone making a gubernatorial run or presidential run on the strength of being a strident opponent or prosecutor of Trump.</p><p>Or you could do it on the other side too: Someone who decides that, OK, this is going to be my star moment, and I’m going to be the next star Republican politician and try to leverage it that way.</p><p><b>We’ve now seen three former Korean presidents out of four be investigated. One died of suicide, and the other two were sentenced to prison. How concerned are you that the process has become politicized and used as a tool of retaliation?</b></p><p>I think there is a right way and wrong way of doing this. The short version is that if the legal process is rigorous and the crime seems very plain and obvious, then there is more legitimacy behind it. And the more it seems like a fishing expedition, the more it seems like, “OK, we struck out on this theory. So let’s try another theory. And another theory, another theory.” If it looks like that, that undermines democracy, because it’s starting to look like persecution.</p><p>And I think that’s what really distinguished the investigation of Roh Moo-hyun versus the investigation of Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak. The crimes of Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak were really obvious. They weren’t hard to understand. And it was pretty well established what they did in terms of a paper trail. Whereas the Roh Moo-hyun case is more like, there <a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20231129000761" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;really wasn’t any evidence connecting him directly to any bribes&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20231129000761&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dcd0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dcd0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">really wasn’t any evidence connecting him directly to any bribes</a>. And it was fairly clear that it was driven by sensationalism. And it was driven by a desire to humiliate Roh Moo-hyun.</p><p>People are not stupid, they can sense if a prosecution is driven by legitimate needs versus a desire to target somebody. And the difference is when the legal process is done in a rigorous way versus sort of this sensationalistic fishing expedition sort of way.</p><p><b>How about the post-Park Geun-hye era? I know Yoon at one point wanted to investigate the past Moon administration and has been cracking down on Lee Jae-myung, his main political rival. And in recent months, there also have been murmurs of wanting to impeach Yoon by his opponents. Do you think there’s more of a weaponization and distrust against prosecutions of politicians since Park’s conviction?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I think it’s still in flux. It’s kind of interesting, but I do think they still trust the legal system. And when someone is vindicated, then they take it seriously. Like, for example, Lee Jae-myung was in danger of getting arrested pretrial, and the judge denied the arrest warrant. And that was a big moment because in people’s minds, that sort of indicated that the criminal case against Lee Jae-myung was pretty weak. Whenever that kind of news plays out, people see that as the legal system working, it’s sorting out the people who committed crime versus people who did not.</p><p><b>Why do you think the Korean public still has so much trust in the courts, despite all the political chaos that the prosecutions of presidents might cause?</b></p><p>When you look at just the straight-on level of trust in government in OECD surveys, South Korea actually scores really low, much lower than the U.S.</p><p>My basic thesis is this: Koreans overall have much lower trust in government than Americans would. But I think that lower trust is actually the flipside of high expectations. Koreans have a high standard of what the government is supposed to do. And when you meet that standard, I think Koreans will lend a great deal of trust, regardless of the fact that their baseline of trust is rather low. I think that’s what goes on with Koreans.</p><p>And I think that works the same way as I described: If the process of prosecuting a president seems vindictive and without real standards, then it will be seen as a type of persecution. If the process of prosecuting the president meets the high standard that people set, then people accept the fact that this is how justice is carried out.</p><p><b>Donald Trump is on trial now. How does the U.S. avoid the politicization of prosecutions that has happened in South Korea?</b></p><p>I think the process should be rigorous, and there needs to be a clear distinction between people who have threatened democracy versus other categories of crimes and violations. Basically, I think that there’s a danger in this “whatabout-ism” in the sense that the attempt to end democracy on January 6 is seen as the same thing as Hunter Biden’s laptop. When you start giving both sides the same coverage when they belong to different categories altogether, I think that is what invites the legalization of politics. It incentivizes people to dig up whatever small little dirt you can dig up and say, “No, you're just as bad as we are.” So I think there needs to be a clear denunciation and clear demarcation of what is so truly offensive that it merits prosecution against the president versus not.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350968717112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><b>Who should we trust to make that distinction though?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Now I’m traveling in a more idealistic direction, but my general sense is that people are not dumb and an engaged and civil society can see this through. They can understand what’s real and what’s not as long as they’re fed good information.</p><p><b>What should the U.S. learn from South Korea as it embarks on the prosecution of a former president?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I think the prosecution of Trump has been handled well. Moving cautiously and making sure that everything as a legal matter is perfectly tied out — I think it’s very good.</p><p>In my view, it seems pretty clear that Trump’s side is the one that’s putting on this clown show. And on the other side, the prosecution is conducting themselves with professionalism. That really will be the most important thing.</p><p>The same thing happened with Park Geun-hye. Park Geun-hye’s attorneys were clown shows. Rather than trying to make a serious argument, they would show up draped in a flag and give a long speech about how everybody’s communist. She already lost credibility as a general matter, but she could not — much like Trump — get good, professional attorneys to represent her. So in the eyes of the public, she lost pretty quickly.</p><p>I also want to touch upon one thing: The fact that Korea prosecutes a lot of presidents is usually coupled with the fact that they’re pretty quickly pardoned in just a few years. There are differing opinions on this, but I sort of fall on the side that maybe it’s not such a terrible thing. There is sort of a ritualistic aspect to the law, right? You go through the process of going through a trial, being sentenced and going to prison like everyone else, and you’re not above the law. You go through this process to feel some level of catharsis but you don’t permanently alienate the people who supported that president by giving them a pardon and not letting them die in prison basically.</p><p><b>Is that something the U.S. should emulate?&#xa0;</b></p><p>It is. It wouldn’t be so terrible, especially because U.S. criminal law is relatively unique in the sense that the penalties are incredibly harsh. This is a very strong criticism I have as a criminal lawyer, that everything in the U.S. is punished with way too much prison sentence. So especially with Trump, if some of these charges stick, I don’t see him getting anything less than like a 20-year term because they’re serious charges. He’s not a young man, obviously that means he’ll die in prison. And I don’t think you want to go down that road. It would be fine for him to, for example, be convicted, maybe spend three to four years in prison. If his health deteriorates, maybe pardon him and let him at least have his final days look dignified.</p><p><b>And that’s what South Korea did with Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye, right?&#xa0;</b></p><p>That is definitely what they did, especially with Park Geun-hye. Park Geun-hye’s health was genuinely bad and she also had genuine fans that if she should die in prison, she would have been a martyr. I mean, she's already a martyr a little bit but even more so than now.<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

Then, the official said, “You know, a lot of people inside the administration ask that same question. Sometimes they ask it on the first day. Sometimes they ask it six months later.”</p><p>I have an answer for them: There is no Biden strategy for Iran.</p><p>If he wants to end the growing chaos in the Middle East, he might want to come up with one.</p><p>The Islamist regime in Tehran is, by many measures, at the root of much of the destabilization across the Middle East and more of a threat to U.S. interests than ever before. Iran is on the verge of obtaining a nuclear bomb. Its proxy militias are spreading mayhem outside its borders. It has stomped out internal revolts, and — as shown by its recent attack on Israel — the regime’s ballistic missile program is going strong.</p><p>But for most of Biden’s time as president, his aides’ No. 1 goal hasn’t been to solve this puzzle, but to keep it off the president’s desk.</p><p>“The strategy is to keep it on low boil on all fronts — nuclear, regional, whatever. That’s been the approach for some time now,” said a second U.S. official, who, like several other people I spoke to for this column, is familiar with U.S. Middle East policy and was granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350978905112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>People in Washington have good-faith disagreements on how to define “strategy,” and many use the term generically. I’ve heard plenty of policymakers grumble about how documents labeled as strategies aren’t truly strategies. But those are abstract debates that often fail to address urgent and concrete foreign policy challenges.</p><p>I’ve come to believe that if the end goal of your effort isn’t to solve a problem, then you don’t have a strategy.</p><p>So when policy wonks use words like “containment,” “de-escalation,” “deterrence” and “risk management” to describe Biden’s approach to Iran, I hear only tactics, not strategies.</p><p>He believes Iran is a problem, but doesn’t appear to have a coherent plan for how to solve it.</p><p>During Barack Obama’s presidency, the administration wanted to solve the problem of Iran’s growing nuclear program.

Another challenge: China and Russia, which once cooperated with the U.S. on certain Iran policies, <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-axis-of-evasion-behind-chinas-oil-trade-with-iran-and-russia/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;are now helping Tehran evade U.S. sanctions&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-axis-of-evasion-behind-chinas-oil-trade-with-iran-and-russia/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dd30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dd30001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">are now helping Tehran evade U.S. sanctions</a>, in part because of their own tensions with America.</p><p>Maybe the administration believes that some other strategy will have an <i>nth</i> order effect that will lead to a lasting change in Iran.</p><p>That appears to be one reason why, even in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Biden and his aides are still pursuing their grander vision of <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/09/09/us-saudi-india-uae-railway-deal-middle-east-europe" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;“regional integration” for the Middle East&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.axios.com/2023/09/09/us-saudi-india-uae-railway-deal-middle-east-europe&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dd30002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dd30003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">“regional integration” for the Middle East</a>.</p><p>This is an actual Biden administration strategy. The problem it ostensibly aims to solve is friction between Israel and Arab states, through a variety of economic, security, diplomatic and other arrangements. The combined aerial defense mechanisms that downed the Iranian missiles and drones targeting Israel this past weekend illustrated the nascent idea.</p><p>The U.S. hopes to see Saudi Arabia and Israel establish diplomatic relations, Washington and Riyadh enter a security pact, and Israel agree to a pathway for a Palestinian state. These pieces all depend on the others, and the people pushing them might as well buy a lottery ticket.</p><p>White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson pointed to elements of this regional integration strategy in a comment for this column.</p><p>“We don’t do policy by bumper stickers,” Watson said. “We focus on actually degrading Iran’s capabilities, while strengthening those of our partners and allies.”</p><p>One could generously call regional integration an Iran strategy, because by putting Iran’s regional adversaries, in particular the Saudis and the Israelis, on the same side, that certainly raises the regional pressure on Tehran.</p><p>I’m not that generous.</p><p>The Middle East is too fractured and complicated for the United States to hope that a regional integration strategy might some day, maybe, lead to a fundamental change in Iran.

The attack was a retaliation for an airstrike by Israel earlier this month that killed a top general with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus. But Haass believes Tehran has miscalculated and will come to regret its decision to shift from its longtime strategy of using proxy forces in places like Syria and Iraq into launching a direct attack on civilian areas in Israel, which has only rekindled sympathy for Israelis.</p><p>“The Iranians have lost control of the narrative,” Haass says.</p><p>Haass, the author of multiple books about foreign policy, retired as president of the Council on Foreign Relations last year after nearly 20 years. Previously he was director of policy planning at the State Department under Secretary of State Colin Powell in the run-up to the Iraq invasion in 2003. Today Haass publishes a <a href="https://richardhaass.substack.com/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;weekly substack&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://richardhaass.substack.com/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dd70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dd70001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">weekly substack</a> called “Home &amp; Away.”</p><p>The question for the Middle East now is whether Iran’s miscalculation will be followed by an Israeli one.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350978905112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>“I like to quote Napoleon's dictum: When your enemies are making a big mistake, don't interrupt them,” he says. “Iran interrupted its enemy at a time when Israel was increasingly isolated and on the defensive, both internationally and in its relationship with the U.S.”</p><p><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p><p><b>With the attack by Iran, the Mideast crisis has become an even more complex situation, with a lot of moving parts. What would you be advising President Biden today?</b></p><p>I’m not sure I agree 100 percent that Israel shouldn’t respond. I think there are two big questions here. Should Israel respond? And if so, how should it respond? The Iranians essentially seem to want to say, “We’re even now, or tit or for tat.” And the president and the administration basically seem to be saying, “Okay, let’s not let things get out of hand.” So, as best I can tell, they are telling Israel at a minimum, "We won’t be with you if you do respond."</p><p><b>“You got a win. Take the win,” is what Biden reportedly told [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu in urging him not to counter-attack.</b></p><p>The only danger in that is whether deterrence has been weakened, because Iran crossed a significant threshold. The homeland-on-homeland attack was an unfortunate precedent. Which is not to say the right response would be to attack Iran’s homeland. There's a case for Israel responding in some ways along the lines of the action that may appear to have precipitated this: going after Iranian proxies, or elements of the Iranian security establishment outside of Iran. But I believe they would be wise to avoid an attack on the Iranian homeland.</p><p><b>But realistically, don't you think the Israelis, particularly a government as right-wing as this one, would view anything less than a response in kind — that is, a direct attack on Iran — as weak?</b></p><p>Certainly, there will be voices that will say that. Netanyahu will probably find himself caught, once again, between competing tendencies in his unwieldy coalition. I would argue for keeping the response very targeted. If Israel decides to act against Iran directly, I would suggest they target, for example, a factory where drones are being produced or a storage facility for drones. It ought not to be something that kills large numbers of Iranians.</p><p><b>One question is whether the Israelis may be thinking about attacking Iran’s nuclear program, which they have already targeted in various ways. Would that be appropriate?</b></p><p>The nuclear program in Iran is so distributed geographically and so protected that a response would have to be enormous. It still wouldn't destroy a significant portion of the program, though it could well set it back by a factor of months or a year or two. But the danger is that, in addition to whatever immediate retaliation would come from Iran, such an attack would provide justification for Iran going for nuclear weapons at a pace and to a degree that is not yet the case. The Iranians could say to the world: “Look, Israel is a nuclear weapons country, and they attack us with impunity. We therefore need nuclear weapons to stop that.” Attacking Iran’s nuclear program would not meet the thresholds or the criteria of proportionality, in my view.</p><p><b>It’s not clear what Tehran was trying to achieve with this attack. Was this a huge mistake by Iran, because until it happened Israel and the U.S. were on the defensive over the humanitarian issue in Gaza?</b></p><p>Yes, so much of the last 48 hours has been many of us just head-scratching over this. Why would Iran do what it did? I like to quote Napoleon's dictum: When your enemies are making a big, big mistake, don't interrupt them. Iran interrupted a situation when Israel was increasingly isolated and on the defensive, both internationally and in its relationship with the U.S., which had reached something of a nadir. At the United Nations, too, the narrative was working in Iran’s favor. Iran had so many other ways to respond effectively — perhaps using Hezbollah to militarize the West Bank or to do things elsewhere in the region. That has been the essence of Iranian national security policy for decades. So this seems to be a major strategic error on the part of Iran.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Perhaps that is what Biden was referring to — the strategic victory as well as Israel’s success in knocking down the missiles and drones.</b></p><p>Yes, the Iranians have lost control of the narrative. And even worse, they've introduced a new narrative, which like Oct. 7 casts Israel as the offended party. What Iran has done is throw Bibi Netanyahu the lifeline of lifelines that allows him to change the narrative. Now it’s about Iran — and Iran is an issue that, unlike Gaza, unites Israelis.</p><p><b>There's been a lot of self-congratulation in the last 48 hours about the effectiveness of Israel’s defense shield, with help from the U.S., and extraordinarily from Jordan as well, in shooting down 99 percent of the attack projectiles. But as I understand it, Iran deliberately did not fire off some of its best missiles. What do you make of that?</b></p><p>It was as if they were going through the motions of retaliation for what happened in [Damascus] Syria, rather than trying to really do something that would be militarily significant. I mean, it almost looks like a compromise. They didn't throw everything they had at it. It looks almost as though it was designed to fail. And then they were so quick to have their mission at the U.N. declare that this concludes things. It’s almost as though, for whatever domestic reason, they had to be seen as responding, but it was more of a political response than a military one.</p><p><b>What does that tell you? Was this about satisfying Iranian public opinion? Are the mullahs concerned about the domestic weakness of the regime?</b></p><p>It tells me that there may be differences between the IRGC and other factions. It’s quite possible the IRGC was demanding a [hard-line] response but others in Iran didn't want it to lead to an all-out conflict. Sometimes compromises that make no sense are the result of competing factions. Because again, on its merits, it makes very little sense to me why Iran didn't simply go with its normal playbook of indirect responses, perhaps targeting a Jewish or Israeli target halfway around the world. I was actually much more worried about them funneling more arms into the West Bank. That to me was a more frightening prospect.</p><p><b>Let's talk about how Biden and his administration have been handling this crisis overall. With the election seven months away, Biden’s under an extraordinary amount of pressure on the Palestinian issue. Would you say this is unprecedented?</b></p><p>Heretofore, if presidents paid a political price, it was for not being sufficiently pro-Israel. What's different now is that Biden is paying a political price for being “too pro-Israel.” So what's unprecedented is that, given the views of younger Americans — Americans of color and larger numbers of Muslim and Arab Americans — the domestic politics of the Middle East have changed. It's now become two-sided, not one-sided, which actually makes it harder for presidents. Biden is the first to learn this the hard way.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Before Oct. 7, the Biden administration was discussing normalization with Saudi Arabia but there wasn’t much attention to the Palestinians. In fact, Biden seemed to be going along with the approach of the previous administration, the so-called Abraham Accords, which basically sidelined the Palestinians. Then after Oct. 7, Biden and his team rediscovered the two-state solution, but they don't seem to be pushing that very hard.</b></p><p>There are four issues of contention with Israel and [the Biden administration] has focused mainly on two. First, humanitarian aid flows. And second, the Israeli use of military force and the lack of sufficient effort to avoid civilian casualties. But missing has been the issue of settlements on the West Bank — either land expropriation or settlement activity — and the other is the political content of a peace process. I'm largely fine with the first two. … But the real oversight, it seems to me, has not been to confront Israel on settlements and to articulate in detail what the United States believes ought to be the parameters of a political process. Of course, right now, neither Israel nor the Palestinians are [ready to negotiate a state]. But sometimes in diplomacy, you put forward ideas not to negotiate but to stimulate a process that will lead to political changes that will allow negotiations to happen.</p><p><b>Do you think that if either this Israeli government or a successor government could address the Palestinian issue, there might be reason for hope in terms of a larger Middle East peace structure — especially with the prospect of Arab normalization and so forth?</b></p><p>It's a long shot at best, but I refuse to give up on it. I’m a firm believer that it’s not just the Palestinians who need a Palestinian state, it’s Israel too. I have no illusions about the odds, and how long this could take and how difficult it would be and so forth. But I really do worry about the consequences of drift, about the idea of one-state “non-solution.” I really worry, not simply that you get a generation of even more radical Palestinians, but that it poses real challenges to Israel's Jewishness or democratic status or both. I think that's bad for Israel. I think it's terrible for the U.S.-Israel relationship. I’m not naïve, but if I could paraphrase [Winston] Churchill, I think a two-state solution is the worst possible solution, except for all the others.</p><p><b>You worked for the administration of President George W. Bush, and you left not long after the Iraq invasion in 2003. How much would you say the United States is still paying for its own errors in the Middle East going back to the Iraq war?</b></p><p>That's a good question. The principal strategic beneficiary of the Iraq war was none other than Iran. And one of the things that struck me the other day when the missiles and drones were being shot at Israel was, look where they were coming from. They were coming not just from Iran but also from Yemen and Iraq. This is the new Middle East. This is the Greater Iran. And to me, that was a reminder of how the Iraq war so imbalanced the region in Iran’s direction. So yes, we are and will continue to pay a real price for the strategic blunder that was the Iraq War.<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

None of the hundreds of projectiles launched at Israel hit a major target. </p><p>So, what was the point? </p><p>The latest crisis to erupt in the region left many longtime analysts wondering what Iran’s real intention was — whether the direct attack was mainly a face-saving exercise or a genuine effort to escalate — and whether the United States can still manage to prevent what it’s been trying to avoid for more than six months, a full-scale regional war.</p><p>Israel and Iran have been involved in a gradual, tit-for-tat escalation since Oct. 7. On April 1, the tensions worsened dramatically when Israel — retaliating for attacks on Israeli citizens allegedly orchestrated by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps along the Syrian border — destroyed an Iranian consulate building in Damascus, killing Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior IRGC commander, and seven other IRGC officers.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350970320112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, declared afterward that Israel would be “punished,” according to the state-run IRNA news agency. And the Iranian response on Saturday — a direct hit on Israel launched from Iran — marked a dramatic and very dangerous departure for Tehran, which until now has preferred to operate mainly through proxies in Lebanon, Syria and elsewhere around the region.<br /></p><br /><p>“There is a greater willingness to run risks by Iran than ever before,” said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the right-leaning Foundation for Defense of Democracies and an expert in Iran’s missile capabilities. “Until now, Iran had never directly targeted Israel from Iranian territory in an overt and attributable fashion,” said Taleblu. “The strike also was the first ballistic missile attack from Iranian territory against a defended target.”</p><p>“Iran wanted to break the taboo of targeting Israeli territory,” he said. “After being able to support the October 7 terrorist attack and orchestrate a multi-front proxy campaign against Israel and not have to pay the price, there's no doubt Tehran was tempted to press its advantage.”</p><p>Until now Tehran has signaled that it doesn’t want an all-out war, having <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/18/iran-proxies-middle-east/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;restrained its Hezbollah ally&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/18/iran-proxies-middle-east/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dde0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dde0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">restrained its Hezbollah ally</a> in Israel’s north from launching more than sporadic token attacks. But “Iran's government appears to have concluded that the Damascus strike was a strategic inflection point, where failure to retaliate would carry more downsides than benefits,” said Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350970702112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>At the same time, Vaez added, Tehran’s choice of weaponry was cautious. “They could have used a much higher number of projectiles, synchronized drones and missiles in a way that would have swarmed the air defense systems, and could have fired their new hypersonic missiles,” he said. “They clearly wanted something spectacular but not fatal.”</p><p>Officials said more than 99 percent of the drones and missiles were shot down and there was only one reported injury, that of a 7-year-old Bedouin Arab girl who was hospitalized.</p><p>“The matter can be deemed concluded," Iran's mission to the United Nations said in a post on social media platform X hours after the start of the operation late Saturday. "However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran's response will be considerably more severe."</p><p>U.S. President Joe Biden is now in the tricky position of persuading Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his hawkish war cabinet to restrain his response to avoid all-out war.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/d9/d8/cedcd22e499785264727cea336e6/biden-mideast-tensions-59507.jpg" /><br /><p>So far, Biden has aimed to deter Tehran by signaling that war with Israel also means war with the United States. In a statement, Biden said the U.S. military had “moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the course of the past week” in anticipation of the Iranian attack, and “we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles.”</p><p>While some Republicans called for a <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4592547-gop-senator-calls-for-us-retaliatory-strikes-on-iran/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;tougher U.S. response&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4592547-gop-senator-calls-for-us-retaliatory-strikes-on-iran/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8ddf0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8ddf0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">tougher U.S. response</a>, even some longtime critics of Biden on the right praised the president’s careful approach.</p><p>“I have to give the Biden administration credit. They have responded better than they did when Jerusalem whacked Zahedi in Damascus,” said Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former CIA official and a Farsi-speaking scholar at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “When that happened, the White House was very quick to signal that the-Israelis-did-it-not-us; this time round, Washington ran towards Israel and has intervened on Israel’s behalf. This will induce greater Iranian anxiety.”</p><p>“Does Khamenei want to escalate against Israel? Yes. Does he want to escalate against the U.S.? No,” said Gerecht. “Unfortunately for the clerical regime, Israel is going to respond directly against it. They have to. The only open question is the magnitude. We are in an escalatory spiral that likely favors Israel more than Tehran in great part because the White House chose not to sit this out and now will be unable to change its commitment to Jerusalem.”</p><p>Even so, Biden <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/14/biden-netanyahu-u-s-wont-join-counter-strike-iran-00152130" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;reportedly told Netanyahu&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/14/biden-netanyahu-u-s-wont-join-counter-strike-iran-00152130&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8ddf0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8ddf0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">reportedly told Netanyahu</a> during a call on Sunday that he won’t support an Israeli counterattack against Iran. (Biden has said he would coordinate a diplomatic pressure campaign against Iran by the G7 nations.) Biden reportedly told Netanyahu, “You got a win. Take the win,” according to Axios.</p><p>Despite that, Israel’s hard-line government is all but certain to continue its habit of defying Washington and strike back at Iran directly.</p><p>Netanyahu is “a leader who simply would not want to be remembered for not having responded to a direct attack from Iran,” said Hussein Banai, co-author of <i>Republics of Myth: National Narratives and the US-Iran Conflict</i>. He added: “A U.S.-led limited counterattack might be the best option in terms of escalation control; but that would mean getting to a consensus between Biden and Bibi, which may be hard to get at this time.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

College administrators have struggled to figure out the right balance between some students’ rights to free speech and others’ rights to be protected from discrimination and harassment.</p><p>That debate erupted at UC Berkeley this week when a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-04-10/uc-berkeley-law-school-dean-clashes-with-pro-palestinian-activists" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;dinner for graduating students&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-04-10/uc-berkeley-law-school-dean-clashes-with-pro-palestinian-activists&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8de60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8de60001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">dinner for graduating students</a> held at the home of law school dean Erwin Chemerinsky devolved into a heated confrontation when a Muslim student disrupted the event to make a pro-Palestinian speech and was physically confronted by Chemerinsky's wife, Catherine Fisk.

Pérez, who attended Berkeley as an undergraduate, is used to the political spotlight, having served for four years as the state’s Assembly speaker. In an interview, Pérez told POLITICO that the student protest at Chemerinsky’s home crossed a line and described how campus leaders can do more to push back on what he sees as a dangerous surge in campus antisemitism.</p><p><i>This transcript has been condensed and edited for clarity.</i></p><p><b>Let’s start with the protest and confrontation at Dean Chemerinsky’s home in Berkeley. Do you think that the students stepped over the line by interrupting this dinner? Did the dean or his wife, Professor Catherine Fisk, step over the line in shutting down their remarks?</b></p><p>The students overstepped the line by disrupting a purely social event at a private home that was intended to celebrate the collective accomplishments of all the third-year law students. They telegraphed their opposition by calling for a boycott [in advance of the event] — that was fine, that was completely within their rights. But they did it in a horrific way, by <a href="https://twitter.com/sfmcguire79/status/1778037351723258077" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;employing an antisemitic caricature&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/sfmcguire79/status/1778037351723258077&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8de70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8de70001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">employing an antisemitic caricature</a> of Dean Chemerinsky.</p><p>What’s interesting is Dean Chemerinsky is a nationally renowned First Amendment expert. And even though he was offended and hurt by the caricature, he defended their right to employ it. He has been the most consistent protector of First Amendment rights of students and student protests as well as others, even when he’s the target of it. </p><p>That’s different than what the students ended up doing, which is going to the house, disrupting the event, refusing to leave when asked to leave, confronting and asserting a First Amendment right that I don’t believe they had at a private home and then asserting that they had legal representation to do it. When Professor Fisk again asked them to leave and they didn’t, and then she confronted and tried to take away the mic, I’m sure in retrospect, she wished she would have handled that slightly differently. But that doesn’t forgive the act of the students disrupting and violating the private personal space and refusing to leave when asked.</p><p><b>What should be the consequences for these students?</b></p><p>So these are my individual opinions as somebody who believes in the right to protest, somebody who’s engaged in a lot of protest on the Berkeley campus, myself, and somebody who’s deeply concerned about campus climate and creating an environment that neither stifles free speech, but also doesn’t victimize and marginalize people. </p><p>Students broadly have been put on notice that if there’s further disruptions, folks will be turned over to Student Conduct and appropriate evaluations will be made. The question becomes whether the campus decides to engage in a student conduct investigation of this and whether the students involved will say they didn’t have fair notice that this crossed the line. That’s something that the campus has got to wrestle with. And I think the campus could come to either conclusion in defensible ways. They can come to the conclusion that students could have misinterpreted this because it’s hosted by the dean as being the same as anything on campus. And the campus can also come to the conclusion that my God, these are third-year law students at one of the top law schools in the country, and that they should have a better understanding about the consequences of their actions.</p><p><b>UC Berkeley, in particular, is in the national imagination as a place of protests — during the Vietnam War in particular. Do you feel like these current protests on campus are different than protests in the past? And if so, how?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I do think they’re different. </p><p>In each of those waves of previous protests, there was a notion from students that engaging in the protest had to serve the purpose of bringing people along in an area of debate, creating space to protest, but also to change minds and bring people in the direction of the justice that they were trying to seek. But there was also a concept of consequences associated with protest. If you want protest without consequence, what you really want is performance. And I think that right now we’re seeing folks engaging in disruption, without an understanding or appreciation for what consequences can come up with it, which I think can sometimes be performative.</p><p>Second, it feels like much of the protest now isn’t, at least from my perspective, effective in trying to move debate and create space to find a new common ground that aligns with the justice that the protesters are seeking. When it’s disruption for the sake of disruption, as opposed to civil disobedience to capture attention and create space for debate, I think it serves a fundamentally different [purpose].</p><p>When you look at the Free Speech Movement, it was about creating the space for all debate, including debate that one disagrees with. What we’ve seen of late is something very different, which is shutting down debate. Last year, at Berkeley Law School, student groups passed a series of resolutions, essentially banning debate, saying that holders of “Zionist viewpoints” would not be allowed to come [to their events]. That’s very different. It’s one thing to say any given organization shouldn’t be compelled to invite somebody who has a viewpoint that’s contrary to theirs. But to say that we want to ban a whole section of debate is inherently problematic in society. It’s particularly problematic in law school, and particularly problematic in a law school centered in a place that in many ways was the birth of the free speech movement on university campuses.</p><p>There has been a horrible spike in antisemitic activity across college campuses across the country, but particularly at elite universities, and there’s been a spike in the community more broadly as well. And I don’t think that we, societally and we, as university leaders, have done enough to push back against this spike in antisemitism.<br /></p><br /><p><br /><b>You talked about these flashpoints across the country, not just at Berkeley or the UCs. Why do you think this war has lit up so intensely on these elite campuses throughout the country?</b></p><p>I don’t know. I struggle with this. One theory is that there’s been significant funding of organizations on elite campuses to push back against the policies of the state of Israel. Second, you look at a student population that is generationally different in its worldview than folks of my age. I’m in my 50s. My fundamental experiences looking at the state of Israel are different than somebody in their 20s. Somebody in their 20s has grown up with an Israel that’s been disproportionately governed by the Netanyahu government, and a government that has been more conservative. Somebody of my age would’ve seen a variety of different expressions of leadership in Israel. I think it’s allowed for a certain shorthand that I think is ahistoric. </p><p>I think you can be, as I am, a supporter of the existence of the state of Israel and the ability of Israel to defend itself and a critic of the current administration leading Israel and the policies of the administration. You can be a critic of government there just like you can be a critic of government here. So I could be a critic of a Trump administration and a supporter of America, somebody else can be a critic of the Biden administration and still a supporter of America. We don’t seem to have a generational ability to afford that same duality with respect to viewing Israel.<br /></p><br /><p>But it goes further than that. What we’re seeing is stuff that we saw in the Chemerinsky caricature, which goes back to old antisemitic tropes — blood libel with respect to the way they depicted Erwin with the bloody knife and fork — and a sense that we’re holding all Jews accountable for anything that we find problematic with respect to the situation [in Gaza] unless and until they actively renounce and reject Israel. That’s really problematic. It really goes against all of the standards of community that we have. </p><p>If it was any other group, we wouldn’t do it. We’re not seeing on college campuses, attacks and questioning every student of Russian heritage because we take issue with the Putin administration, and what they’ve done in Ukraine and other places around the world. We’re not seeing where we’re attacking every Muslim student, because we take issue with what Hamas did on Oct. 7. One can debate the space between anti-Zionism and antisemitism. But one would have to have serious blinders not to recognize that what’s happening on college campuses, UCs included, is a series of activities that are targeting Jewish students because of their identities, making them feel unsafe and apart from the rest of the community in a way that really should have no place in our society and no place on our college campuses.</p><p><b>But we have seen spikes in incidences of Islamophobia and anti-Arab sentiment, too</b><i>.</i></p><p>Absolutely.</p><p><b>Are you saying that the antisemitism we’re seeing is disproportionate?&#xa0;</b></p><p>The antisemitism is absolutely disproportionate. We reject both. We reject all forms of hatred. But what we’re not seeing is massive student protests targeting every Muslim-identified student, asking students of Muslim or Arabic background to denounce or renounce something that they have no part in. The numbers and the spikes are vastly different, and the types of incidences are vastly different. </p><p>I was on the Los Angeles City Human Relations Commission, I think I was president at the time in 2001 when 9/11 happened. We immediately came together and said, ’how do we avoid an irrational targeting of Muslim members of our community in the wake of the response to 9/11?' Now that said, we saw spikes in anti-Muslim activities, Islamophobic activities. That was problematic and offensive. And we've seen some of that now, and we have to speak out against that.</p><p>It’s interesting to me that the only time where we have to do this both sides-y rejection is when the victims are Jewish. When we saw a spike in anti-Asian hate crimes over the last couple of years, there was no immediate pushback that said, now you have to reject these other forms [of hate]. In fact, after George Floyd, when we were talking about Black Lives Matter, there was a clear distinction that if you responded by saying, “All Lives Matter,” that yes, that’s true that all lives matter, but if you were doing it reflexively you are denying the real pattern and problem of what was happening in the African American community. So we’ve got to be careful in that we should be able to have a conversation about the spike in antisemitism, the very clear expression of antisemitism, without then having to do a litany of [denouncing other forms of hate in order] to renounce the antisemitism.</p><p><b>There are a number of California campuses, including three UC campuses — Berkeley, UCLA and San Diego — that at the moment are under investigation by the federal Department of Education in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks because of discriminatory incidents. What can you tell us about where those investigations stand?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I can’t tell you anything about where those investigations stand. I’m not fully read in on the moment to moment of the investigations. And to the extent that I know anything in the middle of an investigation, it would be inappropriate for me to comment.</p><p>But at a certain level, there’s got to be a gut check. When you look at something, does it look right? And then can you go and figure out a way to confirm that your inclinations are correct, and that you can create defensible policies based on that? It was right that you asked about the 1960s in the Free Speech movement, and the antiwar movement. We’re 60 years later. We should have learned from 60 years. How do we adjust in real time? On many college campuses, there’s been such an orthodoxy around the First Amendment that there hasn’t been enough debate about how it exists in conflict with these other protections. </p><p>Let me give you an example of where I think students broadly would say the First Amendment should have limits — sexual harassment. We know that we can regulate certain speech that is, in fact, sexual harassment. At what point does the First Amendment come into conflict and into tension with other sets of laws and other protections? Again, I’m not a lawyer. I’m not a constitutional scholar. But there’s some basic common sense questions that are asked.</p><p><b>Another question around these free speech issues is directly on your plate as a regent. The regents are </b><a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-playbook/2024/03/20/faculty-freedoms-get-tested-at-uc-00147942" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;b>considering banning political statements&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-playbook/2024/03/20/faculty-freedoms-get-tested-at-uc-00147942&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8de70002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8de70003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>considering banning political statements</b></a><b> from the department homepages. It’s largely been seen as a response to faculty groups posting critical statements of Israel and its conduct in Gaza. That vote has been delayed twice.</b></p><p>Who’s the person that moved to delay the votes?</p><p><b>It was you.</b></p><p>It’s an important area of debate and there hasn’t been enough work to land in the right place. And this does cut to the core of who we are. We shouldn’t have unreasonable restrictions on speech. And that speech can take many forms including posting on websites. When the first policy came forward, I didn’t think enough work had been done. So I moved to put it off. And this last one, I don’t know if I made the ultimate motion to put it off or not, but I think I did, again, because there’s more work.</p><p>Any regulation has to be content neutral. What I did say at the last meeting is the timing of it makes the action suspect. Had we done this a few years before, without the current tension, it would be less suspect than it is right now. Now, college campuses have free speech zones. Public buildings have places where free speech is and is not allowed. I think it’s reasonable to say that as we move to a world that significantly exists and people interact with online, you can make distinctions between places where you have official business versus opinion. It’s appropriate. Newspapers have editorial and opinion pages and letters to the editor. Websites don’t do as good a job, in my opinion, of moderating comments, but there’s a distinction between editorial space, news space, opinion space. I think it’s reasonable to try to find that distinction if it’s 1) content neutral, and 2) provides an equally accessible way to access people’s opinions.</p><p><b>I’d like for you to put on your jersey as a lifelong Democrat for a moment. You know that a crucial part of your party’s coalition depends on young people. When you see the intensity of the reaction to the Israel-Hamas war on campus and the criticism that Biden is getting for how he’s been handling this, does that make you worried for November?&#xa0;</b></p><p>You’ve seen the Biden administration’s view and interaction with Israel evolve in real time based on real circumstances. Biden, who has a lifetime record of having a very positive relationship with Israel, has also been trying to hold the Netanyahu administration accountable and pushing back. Is that enough to satisfy the critics? Of course not. It’s appropriate to have tension. But in the end, elections are about choices. This is going to be a question about Biden versus Trump. Students, like everybody else, need to look at the totality of everything that they’re offering as candidates and I think that young people will once again overwhelmingly vote for Biden.</p><p><b>That sounds to me like you’re not very worried.</b></p><p>No, no. I’m worried. But I’m also hopeful. This doesn’t happen magically. It happens by having conversations, by engaging voters, by talking to voters, by looking at what’s at issue. It’s not enough to say, “Hey, young people are going to be so offended by what Trump is doing on abortion..." You have to speak to the concerns that they’ve articulated. <br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350278288112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><b>You’re Mexican American and grew up with deep ties to the Jewish community in east L.A.

Does it concern you that these two communities that you have been so much a part of seem to have a fraying relationship?</b></p><p>It worries me that Americans writ large are becoming more isolationist. There’s not only an interest in us playing less of a role in the conflict in the Middle East, but there’s a spike in folks wanting us to play less of a role in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. But yes, it bothers me that there’s less of a connection between communities that have historically been connected. But Latinos exist in the same world that everybody else does. Latinos are a disproportionately young community — younger on average than just about any other ethnic group. And young people have grown up with 20 years of the Netanyahu administration that they increasingly take issue with. </p><p>Latinos also are horrified by what happened on Oct. 7. Absolutely horrified — by murder, by rape, by torture, by kidnapping. Part of the problem with a poll is what question you’re asking. What does cease-fire mean? Does cease-fire mean a temporary cease-fire, does it mean an effort at sustainable peace? I’m somebody who’s supportive of cease-fire. It can’t be unilateral. It doesn’t work that way.</p><p><b>Putting the polls aside, do you sense a fraying in the relationship between Jews and Latinos?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I think there’s a little fraying in the relationship but what I think we’re seeing is a national spike in antisemitism and it expresses itself in every community. Latinos don’t exist in a bubble. And there has been a persistent rise in antisemitism. And it goes unchecked in ways that discriminatory actions against other communities do not go unchecked.</p><p>When somebody on a college campus targets a Muslim student for identity, targets a Muslim woman for wearing traditional garb, there is offense taken and a pushback. The same isn’t expressing itself when we’re seeing antisemitic acts. At the last Regents meeting, protesters erected an effigy, in violation of policy, of a bloody pig holding a cage, bags of money and [it] said “UC regents time is running out.” Protesters came and took over the Regents meeting and the room was cleared. I think three of us stayed in the room to listen. Nobody took the opportunity to speak to the three of us. It was just chants. And the chants weren’t about a policy, the chants were about Jews. They were about Jews. It wasn’t about this university policy or that university policy, it wasn’t even that the regents need to divest. It was about Jews. It was antisemitic.</p><p><b>What were the chants?&#xa0;</b></p><p>“We've got to go after these Jews.” “We got to stop the Jewish lobby.” It was very clear.</p><p>We have gotten to a point of both sides-ism in this question, which is completely not constructive. When I go around to different college campuses, I tend to meet with a cross section of students and faculty. I have only in my 14 years on the board been challenged once about trying to meet with a group of students. And it was trying to meet with a group of Jewish students on a campus where there have been efforts to target their Hillel. The campus told me that if you meet with Jewish students, you have to meet with the Muslim students. I said, “I’m meeting with students at Hillel because Hillel was targeted.” There’s no balancing that needs to happen. If you asked me to meet with Muslim students because I’m on campus, I’m happy to do it. But it can’t be because I’m meeting with Jewish students. When I go meet with Latino students, I don’t have to go balance that by meeting with somebody else. When I go meet with LGBTQ students, I don’t have to balance that with meeting somebody else. When I go meet veteran students that are dealing with the complexity of coming back after having served and navigating a college campus, I’m not told you now have to go meet with another group. The only time it’s ever happened was in one instance trying to meet the Jewish students. It shouldn’t be the case.</p><p><b>Anything else you’d like to add?</b></p><p>I take all of this personally. I take it a little more personally at a UC because I have responsibility for UC. I take it a little more personally still at Berkeley because it’s such an important part of my life experience. Berkeley is the first place where I ever experienced a Ramadan. Berkeley was the first place I ever meaningfully engaged with the Muslim student community and navigated making sure that we were an inclusive campus for Muslim students. As you mentioned, I have a clear, very personal tie to the Jewish community. But that’s not an exclusion of a tie and an interest in the Muslim community. Having a deep connection to one community doesn’t mean that there’s not a concern and care for another.<br /></p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

Although still comparatively young at 59 in an era of octogenarian politicians, it’s hard to imagine a world in which the first line of his obituary is not that he was the first speaker ever removed from office. So now, McCarthy seems to have set himself to the task of shaping how future generations remember that moment and the eight months he spent wielding the gavel — even if it requires a selective retelling of what happened with a few big omissions.</p><p>This past Tuesday, McCarthy brought his effort to shape his legacy to a windowless auditorium on the campus of Georgetown University for an event called “How Strong Is Our Democracy? With Kevin McCarthy.” If the name of the event is any indication, he wants to be remembered as someone who buttressed American democracy during his time in public service.</p><p>In the late-arriving crowd of around 100 students, one could see the full range of those who would stay inside on the first warm spring night of the year to listen to a retired politician. There were those clad in suits who sat close to the stage to listen while others were busy multitasking, working on assignments or playing word games with their laptops open.</p><p>After the customary introduction, McCarthy, along with former Democratic operative and current Georgetown professor Mo Elleithee, who served as the interlocutor, sat down on the stage and began the program with polite jokes before asking the former House speaker why trust in democracy was so low in the United States.</p><p>Even at an event about the strength of American democracy, there was little urgency in how McCarthy spoke. At a time when both Democrats and Republicans — for very different reasons — warn that “democracy is on the ballot” in 2024, he didn’t seem to have that level of concern about the stakes. Instead, McCarthy offered a broader critique of modern American politics that mixed platitudes about media and the fragmented state of the two main parties with a healthy dose of whataboutism offered in a friendly, self-deprecating manner. He mourned the siloing of how Americans consume media. “You can go home, and you get your news from an outlet that philosophically agrees with you” that offers opinion rather than reporting, he said. “You have social media that's providing something very quickly. There's no editor in charge of what somebody says.”</p><p>And when he had to specifically apportion the blame, McCarthy tried to strike a pose as detached from partisanship as possible for someone who spent the past half decade <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/2022-midterms-kevin-mccarthy-is-the-man-in-the-maga-middle.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>leading a political party in Congress&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/2022-midterms-kevin-mccarthy-is-the-man-in-the-maga-middle.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dec0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8dec0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>leading a political party in Congress</u></a>. For him, the failed lawsuit to throw Trump off the ballot in Colorado and the suppression on social media of the story of Hunter Biden’s laptop were threats just as real as January 6 — an event he took pains to condemn. “What happened on January 6 was wrong; I don’t apologize for anyone who did it,” he said. But it was a critique of those who stormed the Capitol, not those, including Trump, who spent months egging on MAGA loyalists to do so. He bemoaned the increase in partisan politics in Washington. It could have been out of the No Labels handbook, save for the fact that he only blamed Democrats and of course the member of Congress he holds most responsible for his ouster, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).</p><p>He conflated Democratic election denialism and Republican election denialism as he waxed on about what he described as Democratic efforts to overturn past presidential elections, ranging from the hanging chads of 2000 to comments Hillary Clinton made about the 2016 election, before finally addressing his vote against the certification of the 2020 presidential election in Arizona and Pennsylvania.</p><p>McCarthy argued that his vote was simply about expressing some concern over procedural changes during the Covid pandemic rather than any desire to change the result of the 2020 presidential election. It was part of the normal cut and thrust of politics. In contrast, he argued, the Democrats were the ones who tried to overturn elections.</p><p>“The one point I would raise to you is, those who questioned the race when George Bush won challenged Ohio. Had they been successful, Bush would not be president,” said McCarthy, referencing an effort after the 2004 election by a handful of congressional Democrats without the backing of John Kerry to protest voter irregularities, including long waits, for many voters in the state. In contrast, McCarthy argued, “had Republicans who challenged the 2020 race been successful in their two challenges, Joe Biden would still be president. He just wouldn’t have the same electoral votes. A challenge doesn’t mean you’re overturning something. A challenge is a challenge.”</p><p>That wasn’t quite the whole story. Trump allies had initially planned significantly more challenges than just to the electoral votes of Arizona and Pennsylvania, including Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin. This <i>would</i> have been sufficient to overturn the election. However, the number of challenges was pared back after the debate on the first challenge was delayed for 10 hours due to the violent invasion of the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.</p><p>McCarthy also offered his defense of the infamous picture of him with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in the weeks after Trump left office. The visit was viewed as a dramatic boost to the former president’s political fortunes in the immediate aftermath of his second impeachment trial. For McCarthy, this was just supposed to be a quiet visit to a friend going through a tough time.</p><p>As McCarthy described his philosophy of friendship: “Whether I like you or dislike you, if something bad happens in your life, I want to be the first person to call you. … The first thing that happens when something bad happens, [is that] everyone abandons you. I want to call you. … I just want to know how you’re doing as a person.”</p><p>In the former speaker’s telling, he just happened to be in Palm Beach for a fundraiser when he got a call asking him to visit Trump. McCarthy turned down dinner but said he could “come by for lunch.” But then, 30 minutes later, the<i> New York Times </i>knew about the visit, which was supposed to be private. As McCarthy said, “I didn’t tell my staff.”</p><p>(In former Rep. Liz Cheney’s 2023 book, <i>Oath and Hono</i>r<i>, </i>she said McCarthy told her that he went because Trump “wasn’t eating”: “They’re really worried,” McCarthy said. “Trump’s not eating, so they asked me to come see him.”)</p><p>McCarthy then recounted a conversation where Trump quizzes him immediately after sitting down together for lunch. Trump asks the following questions to McCarthy:</p><p>“Did you leak it?”</p><p>“Did your staff leak it?”</p><p>“Do you think my staff leaked it?”</p><p>Each time, McCarthy answered in the negative.</p><p>Finally, the former president asked him ‘Who do you think leaked it?’”</p><p>McCarthy replies “You” to laughter in the room of Georgetown students. Then, in the former speaker’s telling “[Trump] looks at me, and he goes, ‘Well, it’s good for both of us, you know.’” As he was telling the story, McCarthy shrugged, eliciting even louder laughter from the crowd.</p><p>The faux-intimate revelation of these private conversations added to McCarthy’s appeal to the crowd. What went unremarked was how simply resigned McCarthy apparently was to the fact that Trump leaked the story and the sense that dealing with the former president was more akin to managing a tantrum-prone child and a political ally — after all, McCarthy once infamously presented the then-president with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kevin-mccarthy-relishes-role-as-trumps-fixer-friend-and-candy-man/2018/01/15/a2696b4e-f709-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>handpicked Starburst candies&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kevin-mccarthy-relishes-role-as-trumps-fixer-friend-and-candy-man/2018/01/15/a2696b4e-f709-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8ded0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8ded0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>handpicked Starburst candies</u></a> to ensure that he only received his favorite flavors.</p><p>Yet for all the emotional support that McCarthy may have provided after Trump left office, the former president also left McCarthy dangling when he was ousted as speaker. This, too, went unmentioned.</p><p>He was diplomatic when asked about more controversial parts of Trump’s record. “I didn’t know that he had a fake electors scheme,” McCarthy said when asked about the former president’s actions in the immediate aftermath of the 2020 election. When asked about Trump’s references to immigrants poisoning the blood of our country, McCarthy said “I’ve never heard him say that.” He added eventually, “I don’t think that’s what President Trump believes in my time around him. Never heard it.” Trump has repeatedly used the phrase in recent months, including in a March interview on Fox News.</p><p>And as for his ouster in 2023? At one point, he asked, “Want another inside story?” to the crowd, after which he reiterated a familiar complaint that Democrats had betrayed him by supporting the effort. He also blamed the vote as driven by the bad-faith efforts of Gaetz. Gaetz, <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/04/09/congress/mccarthy-on-gaetz-00151412" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>he said, had a vendetta because McCarthy&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/04/09/congress/mccarthy-on-gaetz-00151412&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8ded0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8ded0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>he said, had a vendetta because McCarthy</u></a> did not “stop an ethics complaint because [Gaetz] slept with a 17-year-old.” (The Justice Department dropped its investigation into Gaetz for sex trafficking in 2023, and the Florida Republican has denied having a relationship with a minor.)</p><p>It was all part of a tale that put the best spin possible on his political career.</p><p>At least at Georgetown, McCarthy’s act worked among a crowd where many experienced Trump’s first election before they experienced puberty. The ambitious students all were hesitant to use their names with the typical caution of online undergrads. One junior from Connecticut leaving the event clutching a bag of Sour Patch Kids found McCarthy, “actually really funny, very personable guy.” A Democrat, she said “she didn’t have a lot of expectations” from the event and was just curious to hear the “other side of the aisle’s thoughts going on in Congress and his personal experience.”</p><p>Another sophomore from California, leaving the event in a Zach Bryan t-shirt, also left with a more favorable opinion of McCarthy. He described himself politically as “center-left leaning” and said that while he didn’t agree with McCarthy’s politics, he thought that what the former speaker said about “different people having different experiences and you have to understand that was important.”</p><p>A single event at a college campus won’t determine what goes in the history books. McCarthy held an event the following night at Harvard Kennedy School — this one was called “The 2024 Election, Trump, and the Future of American Democracy” — which went very similarly to the Georgetown event; at times, McCarthy repeated himself word for word. Eventually, they add up. History is a slippery thing, and the way in which figures are enshrined in historical memory constantly changes. Heroes often turn to villains, and sometimes, villains even turn into heroes.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine what values Americans will hold in the 22nd century or if they will even know Kevin McCarthy’s name.</p><p>A House Republican colleague sniped to me last year that all McCarthy cared about was whether he’d become speaker and have his portrait hung in the speaker’s lobby alongside all of his predecessors. But it’s clear he cares about more than that. It’s not just that the portrait is there but that someday, someone will think it will be worth hanging in their office, too.<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

But on Monday in New York, the “hush money” case is set to begin. And Cohen is the star witness — the man who paid Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump. Trump then reimbursed Cohen and, as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleges in his 34-count indictment, falsified records about those payments to “conceal criminal activity.”</p><p>Trump’s defense is simple: You can’t trust Cohen.</p><p>So what does Cohen have to say on the eve of the first criminal trial of a former president, someone who happens to be his one-time boss and mentor?</p><p>A lot.</p><p>I talked to Cohen on Thursday for this week’s episode of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839?i=1000652234879" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1712928099248,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000152-8eed-d275-addf-bfff4c8f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1712928099248,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000152-8eed-d275-addf-bfff4c8f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839?i=1000652234879&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-d278-dd93-a19f-fffa76360000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Playbook Deep Dive podcast&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-d278-dd93-a19f-fffa76350000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Playbook Deep Dive podcast</a> just after he had learned that Trump had attacked him on Truth Social, possibly violating a gag order that Cohen says must finally be enforced.</p><p>Together, we discussed how he will defend the assault on his credibility at the trial, why Bragg’s case is stronger than analysts believe, the legal tactics he’s expecting from Trump’s team, whether he ever regrets breaking with Trump and what Daniels’ tarot cards predicted about the outcome of the case.</p><p><i>This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.</i><br /></p><br /><p><b>I've heard you say that people are wrong when they say that this is the weakest of the four cases against Trump. Tell me if I've got that right?</b></p><p>What I've said consistently is that for whatever the reason might be, the American public treats these four indictments like it's the Kentucky Derby. Everybody's handicapping and picking and choosing which one is the most offensive and violative of law.</p><p>I will concede right now that the January 6th insurrection is more grotesque in terms of illegal behavior than this specific case — campaign finance, hush money, we'll call it business record fraud. That's what I prefer to call it: the "business record fraud" case.</p><p>Then you have the failure to return top-secret documents, showing them to people who do not have proper clearance to see [and] that places America's national security in jeopardy. Yes, that is more abusive towards the law than the campaign finance-business record fraud case. And I will even turn around and say that the Fani Willis case — attempting to overturn a free and fair election [in Georgia] — is more of a grotesque abuse of the law than the Alvin Bragg case. Nevertheless, the campaign finance — the business record fraud — is a crime, and if it was you or anybody else, they would already have been indicted, the case would have already proceeded and chances are they would have already been convicted and sentenced.</p><p><b>Trump's defense is going to be to paint you as an untrustworthy witness. He's going to cite your guilty plea for lying to Congress, and the fact that the Justice Department declined to offer you a cooperation deal because prosecutors thought you lied to them. And he'll say you're out for revenge and that you have a financial incentive to see him convicted. So how do you defend yourself from those accusations?</b></p><p>I wish that when people state that “you lied to Congress,” that you’d do me the courtesy — do <i>yourself</i> the courtesy — of finishing the sentence. What is the sentence? That I had done that, really, for the benefit of Donald J. Trump. And that lie centered around the number of times that I had stated that I spoke to Donald about the failed Trump Tower Moscow real estate project — in conjunction with other lawyers Jay Sekulow, Abbe Lowell, Ty Cobb, with other individuals like Alan Garten or Ivanka [Trump] and Jared [Kushner]. Everybody worked on that statement. I was just the fool who went ahead and read it into the record and submitted it. But what benefit did I have in terms of saying three times versus 10? That's the lie: That I claimed to have spoken to Donald <i>three</i> times about the failed Trump Tower Moscow real estate project, when the true answer was 10.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350787543112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><b>I appreciate you putting it in context. With these other accusations, is that the way you approach it: You put those things in context for the jury so that they understand them,&#xa0; and what sounds like a dramatic allegation can be defanged?</b></p><p>Absolutely. There is a ton of misinformation, disinformation, malinformation that has been put out there by Trump and acolytes literally since the Steele dossier. We all know that the Steele dossier was completely inaccurate, as it related to me. I don't even talk about any of the other allegations raised in that garbage document.</p><p><b>I remember when we were all asking you if you went to …</b></p><p>I've never been to the Czech Republic. I've never been to Prague. As soon as I had gotten out of Otisville [Correctional Facility], I was contemplating on going there and taking photos and tweeting out: "Glad to be back in Prague."</p><p><b>Credibility is one part of this trial. </b><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/11/trump-alvin-bragg-trial-win-00151558" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;b>The other c-word that comes up is \&quot;corroboration.\&quot;&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/11/trump-alvin-bragg-trial-win-00151558&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8df30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8df30001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>The other c-word that comes up is "corroboration."</b></a><b> And that's something that you and Lanny Davis, your adviser and attorney, talk about a lot: that there will be corroboration. What can you tell us about that? Is this a stronger case when it comes to corroboration than people understand on the outside?</b></p><p>If it wasn't, Alvin Bragg and his team of prosecutors would never have brought this case.</p><p><b>Do you think we'll be surprised by it — by some of the corroborating evidence?</b></p><p>I do.</p><p><b>Okay. In other words: We don't know everything that's going to be presented?</b></p><p>In fact, most people don't really know anything. They only know what the headlines have been. And as you know very, very well, headlines do not necessarily tell the story.</p><p><b>One of the big obstacles seems to be how Bragg connects the misdemeanor of falsifying business records that recorded what were actually hush money payments — the payments to you to reimburse you for the payments to Stormy Daniels — to another crime that Trump was trying to commit, which then makes this a felony. That’s sort of the gist of the case. Do you think Bragg has strong evidence on that portion of the case?</b></p><p>Let me say it to you this way — it may not be satisfying to you, and I do certainly appreciate the attempts to drill down despite me telling you I cannot go into into this case: Alvin Bragg would not have brought this case — he would not have that as an element of this case — if he did not believe that he would be able to prove this at trial to a jury of 12.</p><p><b>Michael, your case may end up being the only case that goes to trial this year — meaning that you are<i> the</i> key witness that will determine whether Donald Trump goes to jail before the 2024 election. What is it like having that sort of weight on your shoulders?</b></p><p>It's a heavy weight. It's a weight that is difficult, on a daily basis, to carry around. I wish I wasn’t involved in this at all. Not that I don't want to see accountability; it is incredibly taxing on your heart, on your mind and on your soul. I can tell you from a physical and a health standpoint, since this all started coming down, I'm down 22 pounds.</p><p><b>You look great, by the way.</b></p><p>I look horrible. I'm at the same weight now that I was at when I was released from the 51 days of solitary confinement as a result of an unconstitutional remand against me, weaponized by [then-Attorney General] Bill Barr and Trump to go against his critics. So it's just a side note to those people who don't believe what Donald says, whether it's during these rallies or these ridiculous statements that he makes. Trust me: I've been there. I know what he's intending to do, and he's not bluffing.</p><p><b>Let me just be clear about this, because I think there's some people who think that solitary confinement is a form of torture and should be banned: When you say “solitary confinement,” describe what you mean and what that was like.</b></p><p>I was put into a cell that is approximately eight feet by 10 feet, and it is a toilet, a sink, a locker, a bed and a chair with a desk that's attached to the wall. And you sit there for 24 hours, seven days a week. It's not like you see in “Shawshank Redemption” or any of those movies where you’re out in the yard and able to shoot hoops for an hour. Every now and then, they let you go grab your meal, but then you come right back. The only time you were out was Monday, Wednesday and Friday for 15 minutes to take a shower, or twice a week for a five-minute phone call to your family. My cell was by far the worst of all. The window was broken. It was missing a piece of plate glass. When it would rain, it would rain in on me. During the day, it’s about 100-plus degrees, 105 degrees in that cell, with no ventilation. The flies would come in. The sink was broken. The toilets were broken. The facility in and of itself was filthy. That’s what solitary confinement was for me.</p><p><b>Based on what you know about Trump, what do you think a second Trump term would be like?</b></p><p>In 2018, when I testified before the House Oversight Committee, I predicted before anybody that my biggest fear was that if Donald loses the 2020 election, that there will never be a peaceful transfer of power. Those were my words in 2018. And sadly, it became a reality.</p><p>I’m going to give you my next prediction: If, God forbid a million times, Donald wins the election in 2024, there will never be another election again in America. Because Donald believes, like Putin, that it doesn’t matter who you vote for; all that matters is who’s counting the vote. So there might be this <i>impression</i> of an election, but it will never be a legitimate election ever again. He has no intention of being another one-term president. This, for him, is presidency for life.</p><p><b>On the flip side of that, if this prosecution is successful and ends with jail time, what do you think that would do to the country? And do you think that’s a real possibility — that Donald Trump could end up in jail based on this case?</b></p><p>That's up to the 12 jurors and of course, to the way that both prosecutors handle the case and defense is able to represent Trump on his position. I can’t tell you what will happen or what won’t happen. I’m not the great Carnac; I don’t have the crystal ball.</p><p>I don't believe that Trump is going to win this election. I believe that as a result of his taking credit for the overturning of<i> Roe v. Wade</i>, he has angered a group of America — specifically women in America and those men that support women for women’s reproductive rights — and I think that that’s just one of the very stupid things that Trump, the GOP, MAGA, has done.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/1f/0a/e8c8b1d349fd8c696f612836396a/trump-fraud-lawsuit-72449.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Do you think Trump wants to testify?</b></p><p>I think he’d like you to believe that he would.</p><p>It would be worse than the deposition he gave at the E. Jean Carroll trial case, where he couldn't even recognize that E. Jean Carroll was not his ex-wife, Marla Maples. Donald does not know how to tell the truth. He's lied so many times that he cannot keep track of the lies. And one lie begets another lie. He would be putting himself into a perjury trap by taking the stand.</p><p>He'd be a horrible witness. You guys would all enjoy it because it would give you so much to talk about. "Saturday Night Live" would pay Donald to get up on the witness stand; they wouldn't have to write anything for then maybe the next three, four episodes.</p><p><b>Give us a sense, on the eve of this trial that starts on Monday, just mentally where you are and how you're preparing for this.</b></p><p>Well, my preparation is really just looking over some of the old testimony that I had given. Remember: It goes back to 2018. So it's really just more of a review. My story has not changed. It's just very repetitive.</p><p>I'm not the defendant in this case. The defendant in this case is the former president, Donald J. Trump. So what does he do? He starts to attack. And despite the gag orders that have been put on by the judges, he nevertheless continues to do what he wants. He will say whatever he wants. He violates the gag order. And like a petulant child, there appears to be no repercussion. He legitimately just posted something calling me a sleazebag. And of course, he attacked Stormy Daniels as well. It's called witness intimidation and obstruction of justice.</p><p><b>Will you be asking the court for sanctions and for the judge to enforce his gag order, which does allow for sanctions?</b></p><p>I don't have the right to make that call. That call has to be made by the prosecutors.</p><p>I don't want to testify. I have been extremely clear about it. I have already testified before the Mueller team. I've testified before seven congressional committees. I've testified to the New York attorney general. I've been part of grand jury indictments. You know, now I'm supposed to again testify before the Manhattan D.A. case. I'm not asking to be a witness, let alone be referred to as a “key” witness. I am a non-party subpoenaed witness. My intention is to comply with this subpoena, though I would prefer not to.</p><p><b>Fair. Do you want Bragg to ask Judge Merchan to enforce it, after Trump attacked you?</b></p><p>Well, I think they should — specifically so as to ensure that the case, once it starts on Monday, operates in a respectful manner and one that does not place witnesses — myself included — in harm's way.</p><p><b>You're ready to testify Monday morning, but you just don't know yet when they're going to call you?</b></p><p>There's no chance in the world that I'm testifying on Monday. The process starts with what's called voir dire. That's where they're going to impanel the 12 jurors with the two alternates.</p><p>They are going to pull out every stop they can to try to demonstrate to the judge that they can not get a fair jury — that they can not get a fair trial here in New York. And that way, somewhere down the road, they're going to once again make another motion claiming that they need for Judge Merchan to be recused, that they need the venue to be changed because Donald is afforded, under the Constitution, the right to a fair trial. That's their next move. It will not work.</p><p>Let's say 30 days is what it will ultimately be before the jury gets impaneled. I'm not even expected to be one of the first witnesses. I'll probably be more like in baseball: clean-up. I'll be like a fourth or fifth batter. They're going to keep me on that stand for as long as they possibly can, trying to discredit me. So that way, they can use that to try to make a case during appeal, why this case should not stand, and have it overturned.</p><p><b>You and Stormy Daniels have struck up an unlikely friendship after all you went through. And I know that she's done tarot card readings for you. Did she do a tarot card reading about this case?&#xa0;</b></p><p>She did do a tarot card reading for me when she was on my "Mea Culpa" podcast. I don't specifically remember all of the things that she said, but she turned around and she said that the cards show that Donald will be held accountable.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6349671517112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><b>The jury questionnaire had a question that asks the jurors, “Have you ever listened to any podcasts by or read any books by Michael Cohen?” Suggesting that this is going to be a little bit of an issue. Do you ever regret your sort of media empire that you’ve built? Do you think it has complicated this case?</b></p><p>Well, I appreciate you calling it an empire. Am I upset about the fact that I have done as much media as I have? Absolutely not. Because if it's not me who's speaking and trying to inform the country — not just Democrats, but Republicans and most importantly, the independents, the undecideds — if it's not me, who is it going to be?</p><p>The easiest thing for me to have done early on, when all of this mishegoss was going down in my life, would have been to keep my mouth shut. I probably would have been the first person that Donald pardoned. And I'd probably be working for Fox News, Newsmax. I'd be the head of the RNC, probably, with Lara Trump, or something stupid like that. But I would be putting America's democracy — I'd be putting my children's future and your children's future — in jeopardy. And I wasn't going to do that.</p><p>I can't tell you the number of fellow inmates that would say to me all the time: "Why didn't you just keep your fucking mouth shut? Keep your mouth shut, you'd be the first one pardoned. You would be working right now making millions of dollars with the Republican Party. Instead, you keep fighting him."</p><p><b>In the back of your mind, do you ever think this really wasn't worth it?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I think about everything. I think about the day that Donald asked me to come to work for him. I didn't need to work for him. I was semi-retired. I was 39. I was set; I got lucky early on. I was finally getting a chance to enjoy time with my wife, my children. Unfortunately, I’d just come off of a terrible health issue that almost took my life. And so being sort of sedate, I was looking for something that would have given me some activity that would spark my entrepreneurial spirit again. I like to be busy. And Donald, when he made that offer to me, fit that exact set of parameters.</p><p>That was 2007. He made me one of the three members of the board of Miss Universe. It was Donald, Allen Weisselberg and me — that's not the greatest of company. I was co-president of Trump Productions; he had the number-one TV show at the time. I was working on real estate projects, including one … where we would have built an entire city, literally right before entering New York through the tunnel, with 10,000 apartments. I was given this great responsibility: I was <i>personal attorney</i> to Donald J. Trump. And he was not the Donald Trump that you see today. Donald today is the worst version of himself imaginable.</p><p><b>Explain that transition. What do you think has made him more of a caricature of himself in terms of the way that you're describing him?</b></p><p>Power. The old adage "absolute power corrupts absolutely"? That should be written on his epitaph one day.</p><p><b>You've talked about and written that it was Jared Kushner and Don Jr. that convinced Trump to throw you under the bus. What would have happened if he hadn't listened?</b></p><p>Chances are he may not be in the position that he's in right now because I may not have come clean. I may not have provided the information. I may not have been able to emotionally break away from the cult and acknowledge — despite the ongoing continuous harassment of my wife, my daughter and my son — that I need to snap out of this, that your loyalty belongs to us and the country.</p><p><b>Who do you think Donald Trump will pick as his VP?</b></p><p>Guaranteed it'll be a woman, because he is right now so deep down into the dumpster when it comes to women that he needs to show that he's not the sexist misogynist that he is. And I think if he could find a woman of color, that would be better. But he won't do it. I see somebody like a Nancy Mace or maybe even [Sen. Katie] Britt, because of their looks.</p><p><b>That's important to Donald Trump?</b></p><p>Very, very. He believes in optics. It's almost like why he would walk and he'd have Hope Hicks right by his side, shoulder to shoulder. He believes that everyone is sort of as mentally corrupt as he is, and he's visual. So like with "The Apprentice," him coming off the helicopter with 30 beautiful women following behind him? He thinks it makes him look bigger and more important.</p><p>So I do believe it will be a woman. I believe that, in his mind, he will consider her to be attractive. He also needs somebody who will not outshine him. That's why somebody like a Nikki Haley could never be the choice. She's too strong a person and she would suck up some of his oxygen in the room. And for Donald, owning all the oxygen in the room is what he constantly needs. It's what keeps him going.</p><p><i>Listen to this episode of Playbook Deep Dive on </i><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;i>Apple Podcasts&lt;/i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8df40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8df40001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>Apple Podcasts</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0YmkWN5cyxuqBh5Vl78yGp" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;i>Spotify &lt;/i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/0YmkWN5cyxuqBh5Vl78yGp&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8df40002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8df40003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>Spotify </i></a><i>or wherever you get your podcasts.</i><br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

But it’s far from the only example. Over the past year, in ways large and small, in criminal cases and civil ones, Trump has consistently been given more freedom and more privileges than virtually any other defendant in his shoes.<br /></p><br /><p>Some judges in Trump’s cases may have afforded him unique leeway in hopes of avoiding any appearance that they are meddling in the 2024 campaign. Indeed, Trump’s role as a presidential candidate — one who is always eager to play the martyr — complicates the task of prosecutors and judges eager to lower the temperature of the proceedings. Penalizing Trump before he’s ever convicted of anything could stir a backlash and trigger more heat, not less.</p><p>Trump supporters surely bristle at the notion that he’s getting any preferential treatment. After all, he is facing dozens of felony counts across <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2023/trump-criminal-investigations-cases-tracker-list/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;four criminal cases&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/interactives/2023/trump-criminal-investigations-cases-tracker-list/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e00000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e00000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">four criminal cases</a>, and a series of massive civil judgments has damaged his reputation and his wealth.</p><p>But the fact is that no other person in America — if charged with the diverse panoply of malfeasance that Trump has been accused of — would enjoy the same procedural and structural advantages that Trump has harnessed, to great effect, as his legal troubles reached a fever pitch over the past 12 months.</p><p>There may be good reasons for some of those advantages. A former president and current candidate is no ordinary criminal defendant. But special treatment carries a hefty price: It shatters the American lore that everyone is treated equally before the law.</p><p>The result, ironically, is a partial confirmation of one of Trump’s favorite grievances. He’s enmeshed in a “two-tiered system of justice,” he often says — and he’s right. There are two tiers. But Trump frequently has been the beneficiary, not the victim.</p><p>Here’s how.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/b3/6d/37f852974c14ba55f743eec1ceb7/trump-indictment-37471.jpg" /><br /><h2 style="text-align: center">Avoiding the courthouse chaos</h2><p>It started with the first arraignment.</p><p>Just over a year ago, Trump became the only former president in history to be indicted.

But the authorities made special accommodations that largely spared Trump from the byzantine, often humiliating procedures that thousands of other defendants endure every day. He was not handcuffed. No mug shot was taken. Rather than sitting in a holding cell for hours while waiting for a judge, Trump was whisked through the courthouse and then released on his own recognizance.</p><p>Over the next six months, Trump was indicted in three more cases: two (in Washington, D.C., and Georgia) for trying to overturn the 2020 election, and one (in Florida) for storing classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after his presidency and obstructing the government’s efforts to get them back. The arraignments in those cases largely followed the same choreography. (The Georgia authorities, unlike their counterparts in the other jurisdictions, did take Trump’s mug shot — which he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/26/trump-mugshot-fundraising-00113118" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;promptly used as a fundraising tool&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/26/trump-mugshot-fundraising-00113118&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e00000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e00000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">promptly used as a fundraising tool</a>.)</p><p>No one argues, of course, that the arraignment of a former president should play out like a typical surrender of a suspect wanted by police. The Secret Service, for one thing, would never allow one of their most prominent protectees to spend the day in Central Booking.</p><p>But these special concerns point to a deeper reality that has pervaded Trump’s yearlong odyssey through the criminal justice apparatus: The system was never designed to handle a defendant who is a former, and perhaps, future president.

She has raised the eyebrows of plenty of legal experts — and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/05/trump-classified-documents-special-counsel-judge-00150752" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;stoked the frustrations of prosecutors&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/05/trump-classified-documents-special-counsel-judge-00150752&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e020006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e020007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">stoked the frustrations of prosecutors</a> — by issuing confusing rulings on some pretrial matters while leaving others unresolved for long stretches. Most significantly, her plodding pace has cast a pall of uncertainty over the trial schedule — another delay that benefits Trump.</p><p>In some of the other Trump cases, the kid-glove treatment he has received can be attributed in part to judges’ sense of cautious restraint: They don’t want to create the impression that the Republican presidential candidate is being punished prior to any conviction. But with Cannon, some experts detect a more sinister motive: If Trump is elected, many believe she would be on his short list for a Supreme Court appointment.</p><p>“Moving slowly on that calendar may be less about not wanting to interfere in an election and perhaps more about her own career prospects,” Gold, the Alabama law professor, told me.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/59/f6/9e2900984bf0ad8ad46712b96ace/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1770729915" /><br /><h2 style="text-align: center">Securing a major discount</h2><h3 style="text-align: center"></h3><p>As Trump’s most serious criminal cases stalled, the efforts to hold him accountable played out mostly in civil proceedings.

Wade</i> nearly two years ago created a patchwork — and ever changing — landscape of abortion access in the United States, with roughly a third of states prohibiting the procedure in nearly all circumstances. That includes almost all of the southeastern United States, after a recent Florida Supreme Court ruling triggered a six-week abortion ban in the state that will take effect May 1 and cut off a key regional access point for the procedure.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a 160-year old aw outlawing abortions at any stage of pregnancy unless the patient’s life is in danger, with no exceptions for rape or incest. That decision could take effect as early as the end of May, though it is unclear how, whether and when the law will be enforced.</p><p>And ongoing litigation in other states, such as Nebraska, Iowa and Utah, could mean more changes to state abortion laws this year.</p><p>Abortion-rights groups are also pushing this year to pass constitutional amendments that would protect abortion access in states like Montana and Nevada and overturn abortion bans in Florida and Missouri.</p><p>Explore the map and table below for more on each state’s abortion laws:<br /></p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Every week political cartoonists throughout the country and across the political spectrum apply their ink-stained skills to capture the foibles, memes, hypocrisies and other head-slapping events in the world of politics. The fruits of these labors are hundreds of cartoons that entertain and enrage readers of all political stripes. Here's an offering of the best of this week's crop, picked fresh off the Toonosphere.

Once the full panel is selected — which could happen by the end of the week — the trial will enter its next stage: opening arguments and the presentation of evidence. The jury will decide whether Trump is guilty of having falsified business records to mask a hush money payment to a porn star who claimed she had a sexual encounter with him. Prosecutors say the cover-up in the final weeks of the 2016 election deprived voters of important information about Trump’s conduct with women.</p><p>Other jurors sworn in Tuesday are a man originally from Puerto Rico who works as an IT consultant, a Harlem woman who works in education and a software engineer who lives in Chelsea.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351055597112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>The seven Manhattanites were selected from an initial crop of 96 prospective jurors who began the jury-selection process on Monday afternoon. Dozens of people were dismissed from the pool outright when they told the judge, Justice Juan Merchan, that they could not be impartial. Others were dismissed after further questioning — with some removed by the judge himself and others removed by the prosecution or defense teams, each of which are entitled to strike a small number of prospective jurors without giving a reason.<br /></p><br /><p>The trial will break on Wednesday and resume Thursday morning with a new batch of prospective jurors.</p><p>In a fitting move for a defendant whose public persona has been crafted in large part by his social media behavior, Trump's lawyers have mined the depths of prospective jurors' social media accounts for potential signs of bias in their years-old comments and memes. Several of them were cut on Tuesday after the judge examined their prior posts.</p><p>Merchan dismissed one man after Trump lawyer Todd Blanche presented a social media post in which the juror wrote, “Good news!! Trump lost his court battle on his unlawful travel ban!!!” along with a suggestion to “lock him up.”</p><p>In other instances, however, Merchan refused Blanche’s effort to kick off certain prospective jurors, including one whose husband shared a post suggesting that the comic book team “The Avengers” unite against Trump.</p><p>Though Trump himself said little during the day’s events, he earned himself his first reprimand from Merchan.</p><p>"Your client was audibly uttering something," Merchan told Blanche after he had finished questioning a prospective juror.</p><p>"I won’t tolerate that,” Merchan said. “I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. I want to make that crystal clear."</p><p>Merchan instructed Blanche to tell Trump to stop his antics. As Merchan spoke, Trump sat slumped in his seat, as though he were sitting in a lounge chair.</p>]]></content:encoded>

After losing the case in district court, Trump appealed the decision to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals and then to the Supreme Court. In July 2020, the Supreme Court ruled against Trump, with Chief Justice John Roberts writing in the majority opinion that “no citizen, not even the President, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding.”</p><p>But though the outcome was a victory for the district attorney’s office, clearing that hurdle didn’t guarantee a direct path to prosecution.</p><p>For one thing, the district attorney’s office was exploring multiple inquiries involving Trump, including whether he may have committed tax, insurance and banking fraud over matters unrelated to the hush money payments.</p><p>And for another, Trump wasn’t done fighting the subpoena. He challenged it again, arguing that it was overly broad. Again, he lost his argument in the lower courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court also rejected his final bid to stop his accounting firm from handing over the financial records.</p><p>Finally, in February 2021, Vance’s prosecutors obtained the documents they’d long been seeking.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">Doubts about a legal theory</h2><p>By this point, Trump was no longer president, having left office one month earlier. And Vance’s office accelerated its investigation, hiring veteran prosecutor Mark Pomerantz to ramp up the Trump probe right around the same time.</p><p>In his first few weeks on the case, Pomerantz decided to focus his efforts on the hush money portion of the district attorney’s sprawling investigation.<br /></p><br /><p>“The return to life of the hush money facts as a potential basis for prosecution sparked a nickname for this part of the investigation: the hush money inquiry came to be known as the ‘zombie’ case, because it was alive, and then it was dead, and now it had sprung back to life,” Pomerantz later wrote in his book, “People v. Donald Trump: An Inside Account.”</p><p>But by March 2021, prosecutors had struggled to settle on a legal theory for charging Trump in the hush money matter. They were concerned that charging him with felonies for falsifying business records might not hold up in court, according to Pomerantz. So it went “back into the grave,” he wrote.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">A sprawling investigation continues</h2><p>On March 12, Vance said he wouldn’t run for reelection and would leave office at the end of the year. He also said internally that before stepping down he would make a decision about whether to charge Trump.</p><p>Over the next few months, the district attorney’s office moved on to other areas of inquiry related to Trump, including looking at whether he had inflated the valuations of his properties — a matter that was eventually brought as a civil case by the New York attorney general’s office — and whether the Trump Organization had doled out untaxed perks to its executives.</p><p>By May, prosecutors began presenting information about the untaxed perks to a grand jury, and by the beginning of July, it had indicted the Trump Organization and its then-CFO Allen Weisselberg.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">New top prosecutor, new approach</h2><p>In November, Vance’s successor, Alvin Bragg, was elected as district attorney.</p><p>Bragg was sworn in in January 2022, and in his initial weeks in office, he hesitated on moving forward with the case related to valuations. And as a result, prosecutors paused their presentation of evidence about Trump to a grand jury. Shortly thereafter, Pomerantz and another top lawyer who had been leading the Trump investigation, Carey Dunne, resigned from the office.<br /></p><br /><p>By the fall, though, Bragg’s office had renewed its interest in the piece of its inquiry that focused on the hush money payment to Daniels. And by January 2023, prosecutors had begun presenting evidence on that case to a new grand jury.</p><p>Over the next two months, the grand jury heard from witnesses including Cohen and Daniels, and prosecutors signaled that they had reached the final stages of their investigation by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/15/stormy-daniels-speaks-to-new-york-prosecutors-as-possible-trump-indictment-looms-00087307" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;offering Trump the opportunity to speak to the grand jury himself&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/15/stormy-daniels-speaks-to-new-york-prosecutors-as-possible-trump-indictment-looms-00087307&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e220002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e220003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">offering Trump the opportunity to speak to the grand jury himself</a>.

Aaron Dean, the adjutant general of the D.C. guard at the time, told House Administration Committee staffers that if Trump had reached out that day — which, by all accounts, he did not — he might have helped cut through the chaos amid a tangle of conflicting advice and miscommunication.</p><p>“Could the president have picked up the phone, called the secretary of defense, and said, you know, ‘What’s going on here?’ Our law enforcement is getting overrun, make this happen!’” a committee staffer asked Brooks, according to the transcript of a previously unreported March 14 interview reviewed by POLITICO.</p><p>“I assume he could expedite an approval through the Secretary of Defense, through the Secretary of the Army,” Brooks replied.</p><p>But Trump never called any military leaders on Jan. 6, per testimony from senior administration officials to the Jan. 6 select committee — a fact that the panel emphasized in its final report that concluded Trump was uniquely responsible for the violent Capitol attack by his supporters. Rather, he was observing the riot on TV and calling allies in his quest to subvert the 2020 election, as outlined by committee witnesses and White House records.</p><p>Brooks’ exchange with the committee staffer underscored the reality of Trump’s inaction: “And to your knowledge, did that happen on January 6th?” the staffer continued.</p><p>“No,” Brooks said.</p><p>Dean, similarly, noted that if Trump had placed a call to Pentagon leaders at 2 p.m. — around the time the Capitol was first breached — and said “go,” the guard would have reached the Capitol sooner than it did that day.</p><p>“I think if the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of Defense, or the president had said ‘Go,’ … or a combination thereof had said ‘Go,’ then we would’ve gone and we would’ve been there much faster,” Dean told congressional investigators on March 26.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/dc/4f/38758f43414aabe4de707d38e517/capitol-riot-newspaper-editor-33208.jpg" /><br /><p>Brooks and Dean are among four witnesses slated to testify Wednesday before a House subcommittee probing security failures that exacerbated the breach of the Capitol. All four were top advisers to William Walker, the commander of the D.C. guard on Jan. 6. Other witnesses include Timothy Nick, who was the aide-de-camp to Walker, and Earl Matthews, a top lawyer for the National Guard at the time. POLITICO reviewed transcripts of closed-door interviews that all four men gave to the Administration Committee over the past five weeks.</p><p>The bulk of their testimony focused on deep disagreement between the D.C. guard leadership and the Pentagon about when and whether an order was given to deploy to the Capitol. The witnesses told the Administration Committee that military leaders seemed reluctant to send guard troops to the Capitol until hours after violence had broken out.</p><p>Further, they described mixed messages on phone calls with the Pentagon that left them in a holding pattern, lacking clarity about whether they had permission to deploy. All four also indicated they had testified to the Jan. 6 committee in an “informal” capacity, meaning there were no transcripts of their interviews.</p><p>And they said they had virtually no contact from Ryan McCarthy, the then-Army secretary, even though he was a key player who was in frequent contact with the D.C. guard in the run-up to Jan. 6.</p><p>McCarthy did not respond to a request for comment. He has <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000042158/pdf/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000042158.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;told the Jan. 6 committee&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000042158/pdf/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000042158.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e270001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e270002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">told the Jan. 6 committee</a> that a call from Trump would not have hastened the National Guard response because he was already moving as quickly as possible.</p><p>The testimony is the latest addition to a complicated picture of the military’s response to the violence, which raged for hours on Jan. 6 until the D.C. police and National Guard helped the Capitol Police contain it that evening. The riot select committee found that Trump made no calls to senior leaders of the Justice Department, Pentagon or Department of Homeland Security while the violence raged — nor did he reach out to his vice president, Mike Pence, who was sheltering from the mob at the Capitol.</p><p>Rather, Trump watched the riot unfold on TV and made phone calls to lawmakers who he hoped would support his bid to block President Joe Biden’s victory.</p><p>The men, whom the panel described as “whistleblowers,” sharply dispute claims by former Pentagon leaders — from McCarthy to then-Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller to former Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley — that the National Guard was deployed to the Capitol as quickly as possible on Jan. 6.</p><p>Rather, they say, they had no contact from Miller or McCarthy until much later in the day, and they sharply dispute claims that McCarthy authorized the guard’s deployment to the Capitol by 3:04 p.m. on Jan. 6.</p><p>That’s the context in which Brooks and Dean suggested that perhaps a phone call from Trump — as conditions at the Capitol were clearly deteriorating — could have cut through the clutter and resulted in a quicker deployment.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6348435513112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Matthews differed from Brooks and Dean on the question of whether Trump’s involvement could have made a difference. Because Trump had already delegated authority to Miller and McCarthy, there was little for him to do, according to Matthews, who told the Administration Committee that it’s not clear whether McCarthy would have heeded his call.</p><p>“The president wasn’t going to call us because he’s trusting the chain of command,” Matthews told the Administration panel. He noted that some testimony to the Jan. 6 committee underscored concerns among military leaders that Trump might try using a troop presence at the Capitol for nefarious purposes.</p><p>In his testimony to the Jan. 6 committee, McCarthy denied harboring concerns that Trump might misuse the National Guard.</p><p>“I mean, in the lead-up to it, [I] did not see anything that would give you the sense he was going to order us to send troops to the Capitol in support of anything untoward,” McCarthy said.</p><p>In a statement Matthews issued ahead of his public testimony, he elaborated on his belief.</p><p>“The committee knew that even if President Trump had called down personally to the Secretary of the Army, who had effective operational control of the D.C. National Guard, to direct the immediate movement of the Guard, it would have had no impact.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

The store was the site of a 2022 fatal stabbing, which the perpetrator described as self defense against an unprovoked attack in a case that inflamed conservatives.</p><p>The appearance signaled an effort by Trump to go on the offensive after two days besieged in court, while kneecapping Alvin Bragg, the Democratic prosecutor trying his case. Unfolding on the sidelines of the trial, the brief remarks served as the opening of the weeks-long, courtroom-constricted phase of Trump’s campaign — a relentless critique of Democrats’ handling of crime to counter public focus on his own criminal cases.</p><p>“It’s Alvin Bragg’s fault. Alvin Bragg does nothing; he goes after guys like Trump who did nothing wrong,” Trump told reporters gathered outside the store. “There are hundreds of murderers all over the city. They know who they are, and they don’t pick them up. They go after Trump.”</p><p>He used the opportunity to similarly go after the influx of migrants into New York City, seeking to pit them against Black and Latino residents and going so far as to predict he would win New York — an unlikely outcome, as no Republican presidential candidate has carried the state in 30 years.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/2d/f9/4f68025445aa95a736f5343da816/img-0103.jpg" /><br /><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/17/63/3ad8db144e3ea6025a47e9f7371d/img-0107.jpg" /><br /><p>Anticipating the attack on his record, <a href="https://twitter.com/manhattanda/status/1780329213095981199?s=46" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Bragg’s office tweeted NYPD statistics&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/manhattanda/status/1780329213095981199?s=46&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e300000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e300001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Bragg’s office tweeted NYPD statistics</a> showing a 39 percent drop in shootings and a 23 percent drop in murders over the past year in Manhattan. </p><p>Trump, flanked by Bodega and Small Business Group member Carlos Collado and the bodega’s owner, Maad Ahmed, called his trial “rigged” and said of the judge overseeing his case, “There’s never been a judge so conflicted as this.”</p><p>The presumptive GOP presidential nominee spent much of Tuesday in court, before the trip to the bodega where clerk Jose Alba fatally stabbed a customer who was attacking him in a case that captured the attention of Republicans nationally. Alba was initially charged with murder, but Bragg later dropped the charges.</p><p>“This matter was resolved nearly two years ago, and the charges were dismissed after a thorough investigation,” Bragg spokesperson Doug Cohen said. “DA Bragg’s top priority remains combating violent crime and the office has worked hand in hand with the NYPD to drive down overall crime in Manhattan, including double digit decreases in homicides and shootings since he took office.”</p><p>Trump’s visit put him on Bragg’s turf — the neighborhood that raised the top prosecutor, after two days in a courtroom where he is being tried on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351055597112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Trump’s campaign permitted several dozen supporters to pack into a space near the bodega, where they cheered him loudly, chanted, “Four more years!” and sang, “The Star-Spangled Banner.” He greeted them warmly before heading into the store for a few minutes. </p><p>Beyond the police barricades, hundreds of New Yorkers crowded to watch the spectacle. And while some appeared to support Trump, others booed him. Just after his motorcade took off, a group arrived with a sense of humor and a banner advertising, “Trump dildos on sale now.”</p><p>The incident highlighted the complications of running for president while on trial.</p><p>The drama unfolding in the Manhattan courtroom and the trial’s demands on the former president’s schedule are not welcome by the candidate or his campaign<b>, </b>which has sought repeatedly to delay the trial. But Trump has decided to make the most of it, using it to underscore his claims that the justice system is unfairly rigged against him and that he is the victim of political persecution.<br /></p><br /><p>Trump's campaign has also worked closely with his allies to make sure they are blanketing the airwaves with talking points that tie the trial to President Joe Biden. Surrogates have been asked to call this the "Biden trials," a phrase the former president has used himself as he railed against the proceedings on Truth Social.</p><p>On the social media site on Tuesday, Trump wrote, “MY TRIAL IS AN ASSAULT ON AMERICA!”</p><p>Democrats, readily on the defensive over crime and border security, have sought to play up their electoral advantage on abortion — tying Republicans and Trump, specifically, to what have proven to be unpopular restrictions since the overturning of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>.</p><p>Trump’s appearance Tuesday also served as a preview of the way he is likely to campaign for the duration of the proceedings. On Trump's days off from the trial — Wednesday, when the judge attends to other business, and the weekends — he plans to attend fundraisers and continue campaigning. This weekend he will attend a fundraiser and rally in North Carolina. And like he did on Tuesday, he is expected to have unannounced stops in the New York area to talk about immigration and crime. </p><p>On Tuesday, he told reporters he will do rallies “all over the place” during the trial.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/f5/8e/61a0e27f45578db6f5c3d836720e/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2147853732" /><br /><p>Despite Trump’s claims of increased crime in New York City, NYPD statistics show overall crime fell 1 percentage point from 2022 to 2023.

Democratic outside groups are also working to dig up dirt on Kennedy and his newly named running mate, Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneur and philanthropist.</p><p>In the Biden campaign’s latest move, members of the extended Kennedy clan “pledged our unwavering support” to Biden over Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said RFK Jr.’s sister Kerry Kennedy in a speech at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Thursday. So far, the Kennedys, descendents of one of the most beloved Democratic presidents, have largely shunned their family member, some of them calling his campaign “dangerous.” </p><p>But the formal endorsement, which featured more than a dozen Kennedy family members, takes that push back a step further. </p><p>“We want to make crystal clear our feeling that the best way forward for America is to re-elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to four more years,” Kerry Kennedy said, who led a chant of “four more years.” Her brother, however, went unmentioned by name in her speech. </p><p>Biden, for his part, called it “an incredible honor to have the support of the Kennedy family.” He noted that a bust of Robert F. Kennedy, one of his “heroes,” is currently displayed inside the Oval Office, alongside Martin Luther King, Jr. </p><p>The Kennedy family’s endorsement is part of a broader, all-party effort to attack the RFK Jr.’s campaign, which Biden aides and Democratic allies see as a threat to his election. Democrats acknowledge that in a race that could be decided by thousands of votes in a few states, they’re not taking any chances with third-party candidates, which include Kennedy, Cornel West and Jill Stein.</p><p>“He’s a guy with a famous last name, so he can be dangerous and he can pull voters, who are not particularly engaged, away from Joe Biden,” said Pat Dennis, president of American Bridge, one of the Democratic groups focused on opposition research against RFK Jr.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350145122112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>But Dennis said that when voters “are educated about who [Kennedy] is, about his conspiracy-minded nature, then [Donald] Trump is in trouble” because then those voters are then drawn to the former president, instead of Biden, so “that’s why we’re helping to make sure the electorate knows who RFK Jr. is.”</p><p>Kennedy, for his part, said he was “pleased” his family is politically active, “it’s a family tradition.”</p><p>“We are divided in our opinions but united in our love for each other,” Kennedy <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1780977861064794359" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;said in a post on X&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1780977861064794359&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e340004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e340005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">said in a post on X</a>, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>It’s not just Democrats who are concerned about Kennedy’s ability to affect the race. Trump has repeatedly called Kennedy “the most radical liberal” on his social media platform Truth Social. That prompted Kennedy to claim that Trump’s team <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/15/rfk-jr-trump-running-mate-00152272" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;asked him to consider joining the former president’s ticket&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/15/rfk-jr-trump-running-mate-00152272&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e340006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e340007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">asked him to consider joining the former president’s ticket</a>. A Trump adviser denied Kennedy’s story.</p><p>Kennedy’s impact on the race is clear in public polling. Kennedy consistently polls in the high single digits in national surveys, as he siphons off support from both Biden and Trump. For example, a <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3894" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;late March Quinnipiac poll&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3894&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e340008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e340009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">late March Quinnipiac poll</a> found Biden leading Trump by 3 points in a head-to-head matchup. But Trump took a 1-point lead over Biden when third-party candidates were added, who drew 13 percentage points of support. However, it was primarily Stein and West who hurt Biden.</p><p>“It’s important for a well-resourced campaign to leave nothing on the table, and that includes talking to voters who are pausing and curious about Kennedy, but who are actually going to find him unpalatable when they find out who he is,” said Margie Omero, a Democratic pollster. “A challenge would be to have people ascribe whatever qualities they want to him as a third-party candidate.”</p><p>“The issue here is leaving nothing to chance,” Omero added.</p><p>Kennedy has leaned into his family’s history as a means for attracting support. A pro-Kennedy super PAC <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/11/robert-kennedy-super-bowl-ad-00140903" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;aired a $7 million ad&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/11/robert-kennedy-super-bowl-ad-00140903&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e34000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e34000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">aired a $7 million ad</a> during this year’s Super Bowl that used a 1960 ad from his uncle, President John F.

This week, it was almost like a “Trump for governor” or “Trump for mayor” campaign that never was — the whole episode barely connected to the idea of the presidency.</p><p>“Everything is screwed up in New York,” Trump said, “and the whole world is watching.”</p><p>It was a stretch for Trump to say that he will “make a heavy play for New York,” a state that has not voted for a Republican for president since 1984, and one where Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/new-york/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;lost to now-President Joe Biden by more than 23 percentage points in 2020&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/new-york/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e3c0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e3c0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">lost to now-President Joe Biden by more than 23 percentage points in 2020</a>.</p><p>But as he spoke with reporters in New York, a bastion of Democratic politics, Trump’s read of the news landscape — if not the political one — seemed spot on. In the media capital of the world, Trump said he suspected there was “more press here than there is if I went out to some nice location.”</p><p>“He’s right,” said Dave Catalfamo, a Republican consultant in New York.</p><p>Trump’s prosecutors had given Trump a “platform,” Catalfamo said, and the former president “takes advantage of his masterfully.”</p><p>“The way we consume our news now, and the way that he gets covered, he’s utilizing the stage that’s before him,” Catalfamo said.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/fa/ec/dcd60f0544c0bcdd5635ebe6ea6f/useuntil-05-16-2024-trumptrial-018.jpg" /><br /><p>The substance of Trump’s visit was a throwback to Trump’s messaging in the 2020 campaign, when, following the anti-police protests in the wake of George Floyd’s murder — and in an effort to replicate the Nixonian “law and order” rhetoric of half a century ago — he laced into Democrats for crime in the nation’s largest, Democratic-run cities.</p><p>But now, amid Trump’s own legal entanglements, the subject served another purpose for him — casting doubt on the legal system, much as he did the electoral system in 2020, portraying his accusers as partisans in an effort to discredit them.</p><p>Outside the bodega, Trump called his trial “rigged” and said of the judge overseeing his case, “There’s never been a judge so conflicted as this.”</p><p>Trump has repeatedly claimed that Justice Juan Merchan has conflicts of interest, and Trump's lawyers have unsuccessfully asked the judge to step down from the case. Last year, a New York judicial ethics panel <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/ipjudicialethicsopinions/23-54.htm" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;rejected Trump's allegations&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nycourts.gov/ipjudicialethicsopinions/23-54.htm&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e3c0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e3c0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">rejected Trump's allegations</a> that Merchan is biased, concluding “the judge's impartiality cannot reasonably be questioned.”<br /></p><br /><p>There’s reason to think Trump may be having some success in this line of critique.

Shafik seemed far more prepared than the presidents of Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who testified before the committee that month.</p><p>She told one GOP lawmaker that she spent “many hours” preparing, and another GOP lawmaker congratulated her on “saying the right things.”<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351122652112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>“Columbia beats Harvard and UPenn!” Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/aa338d02-bfc3-48a3-9c87-d7842e7af1f6" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Aaron Bean&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/aa338d02-bfc3-48a3-9c87-d7842e7af1f6&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e4a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e4a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Aaron Bean</a> (R-Fla.) said. “Y'all have done something that they weren't able to do. You've been able to condemn antisemitism without using the phrase: ‘It depends on the context.’ But the problem is: Action on campus doesn’t match your rhetoric today.”</p><p>Unlike the previous antisemitism hearing, lawmakers did not call for Shafik to resign. Republicans, and even some Democrats, focused on getting rid of university faculty who they say used antisemitic rhetoric.</p><p>Shafik, who testified alongside Board of Trustees Co-Chairs Claire Shipman and David Greenwald, and law professor David Schizer, one of the university’s antisemitism taskforce chairs, answered personnel questions about faculty and students, and attempted to address some of the bizarre questions from GOP lawmakers about the Bible and the definition of the term “folx.”</p><p>Questions about whether protests on campus were anti-Jewish or anti-Muslim, or if phrases used by students were antisemitic, however, gave Shafik pause. In those moments the other Columbia leaders chimed in — but that didn’t stop lawmakers from poking holes in Shafik’s testimony. </p><p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/19aaa822-11fd-4f17-b003-e0291965010d" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Virginia Foxx&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/19aaa822-11fd-4f17-b003-e0291965010d&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e4a0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e4a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Virginia Foxx</a> (R-N.C.), who helms the House education panel, called some of Shafik’s testimony misleading, and Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/84d7d4ed-17f5-46aa-b486-b25a755a4a87" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Elise Stefanik&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/84d7d4ed-17f5-46aa-b486-b25a755a4a87&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e4a0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f741-d903-adce-ff4f8e4a0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Elise Stefanik</a> (R-N.Y.), who had previously given the other presidents the toughest grilling, tried to accuse Shafik of changing her testimony.</p><p>Here are the top five moments from the hearing.<br /></p><h2></h2><h2 style="text-align: left">Stefanik tried, and tried, and tried, to create a memorable scene</h2><p>The No. 4 Republican in the House, who was the first lawmaker to take her seat in the hearing room, showed up with a thick stack of documents littered with yellow sticky notes.
