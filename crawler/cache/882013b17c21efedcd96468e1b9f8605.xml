On Thursday, CIA Director William Burns warned that, barring more U.S. aid, Ukraine "could lose on the battlefield by the end of 2024."</p><p>It heightened the sense of urgency surrounding a White House effort to convince Johnson to hold a public vote on Ukraine aid that has dragged on behind the scenes since the day he became speaker. Johnson had resisted for months in the face of growing threats to his speakership if he sided with Biden and allowed the vote.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350643815112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Since the last time Congress approved aid to Ukraine in late 2022, conservative skepticism of sending U.S. weapons and dollars to the country has grown, threatening Johnson’s speakership as well as Biden’s foreign policy agenda.</p><p>But he has now effectively locked arms with the president: Johnson's alignment with Biden this week has extended at times even to deploying similar talking points in favor of funding Ukraine, and comes in defiance of efforts by conservatives like Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/405104" data-person-id="405104" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1713487384397,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1713487384397,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;405104\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/405104\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Sen.

It would stabilize a Ukrainian defense running low on munitions and bracing for a renewed Russian offensive in early summer.</p><p>It’s also validation, Biden aides and allies said, of a White House strategy focused on slowly courting Johnson behind the scenes while letting him find his own path to a solution — even if it meant weathering frequent setbacks and building frustration within its own party.</p><p>"Everybody knows we've got to get Ukraine funding," said another lawmaker, a Democrat close to the White House, “We're at the precipice."</p><p>Johnson had grown increasingly vocal for the last several weeks in privately promising lawmakers that he'd allow Ukraine aid to come to the floor for a vote. With other pressing priorities such as government funding and spy authority stacked through March and into April, this week provided one of the first openings to move on Ukraine.</p><p>“Here is an opportunity to make that stand at a really crucial time in world history," he said on CNN on Wednesday, framing the aid push as a moral imperative for the GOP and critical to standing up to Russia's aggression.</p><p>Over the past several months, the White House sought to build indirect pressure on Johnson, stressing the seriousness of the situation to Ukraine-sympathetic GOP lawmakers. The administration held several closed-door briefings for Johnson and other lawmakers to update them on the deteriorating situation in Ukraine, starting just days after Johnson became speaker.</p><p>Senior Biden officials, including Burns and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, have also kept in close personal touch with a handful of lawmakers to discuss the evolving intel.</p><p>“Speaker Johnson understands the gravity of the situation. He's been provided with different information now,” said Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/192907" data-person-id="192907" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1713487428885,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1713487428885,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;192907\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/192907\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Sen.

Pressure from the White House and Ukraine-supporting lawmakers was building. Conservatives opposed to helping Ukraine made clear they'd threaten Johnson's job no matter how he handled the situation. And Iran's strikes on Israel generated renewed momentum for crafting an overall aid package that could help a range of U.S. allies.</p><p>It was the kind of opening that Democrats had hoped for months they could convince Johnson to seize before it was too late.</p><p>"I think he's made some hard choices and he's putting his job in peril as a result," said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/66846" data-person-id="66846" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1713487441381,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1713487441381,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;66846\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/66846\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Rep.

"I don't think I agree with him politically on anything, but I do think he has integrity. And I do think he's acting like a leader."</p><p>The White House declined to comment on its discussions with Johnson and the speaker’s camp pointed to his recent interview on CNN and other media outlets. The administration has steered clear of the debate in Congress this week for fear of derailing the aid package.</p><p>Biden during a Monday night call urged Johnson to pass the new funding by the end of the week. But he's been out of town since then, and has not addressed the effort beyond a short statement of support.</p><p>Republicans who support Ukraine have largely dismissed suggestions that Biden has played any defining role in delivering a Ukraine aid bill. They have long argued the president hasn’t made strong enough use of his bully pulpit to make the case for defending Ukraine against Russian aggression.</p><p>“I'm not trying to take a cheap shot at the administration, but they have not really done a very good job of extending an olive branch,” Tillis said.</p><p>Biden allies said the president and his top aides have prodded Johnson since he took over as speaker, encouraging him to hold a public vote on the Ukraine aid he privately told them he supported. That backchannel remained open even as the White House publicly criticized Johnson for rejecting a Senate-passed bill that would have sent funds to Ukraine.</p><p>The administration has “been pushing and they think he has the insight and intelligence as well as the temperament to be a listener," said Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151824" data-person-id="151824" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1713487459865,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1713487459865,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;151824\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151824\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Sen.

Vance partially to blame.</p><p>Last week, the Ohio Republican authored a New York Times op-ed headlined “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/12/opinion/jd-vance-ukraine.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;The Math on Ukraine Doesn’t Add Up&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/12/opinion/jd-vance-ukraine.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70c000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70c000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">The Math on Ukraine Doesn’t Add Up</a>,” and he’s followed that up by <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/04/17/congress/vance-00152828" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;meeting with&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/04/17/congress/vance-00152828&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70c000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70c000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">meeting with</a> the House’s Republican Study Committee on Wednesday to whip against Johnson’s Ukraine bill.</p><p>Earlier this year I spent months speaking to Vance for an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/15/mr-maga-goes-to-washington-00147054" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;extensive profile&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/15/mr-maga-goes-to-washington-00147054&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70c000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70c000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">extensive profile</a> exploring how the freshman Republican has become Donald Trump’s most loyal ally in the Senate, while also laying the groundwork for an even more expansive and radical vision of the “America First” worldview. During my hours of talking with Vance, he defended his persistent opposition to U.S. aid to Ukraine, which he — even more so than Trump — has elevated as a signature issue since entering the Senate last year.</p><p>Yet that opposition also emerged as one small part of Vance’s much broader — and more sweeping — theory of international affairs. If Vance gets his way, cutting off U.S. funding to Ukraine will be only the first step in a much broader reorientation of the U.S.’s role in the global order.<br /></p><br /><p>Vance is deeply skeptical of the so-called rules-based international order — the system of laws, norms and multilateral institutions established in the years following the Second World War to mitigate global conflict and facilitate international economic activity. As Vance sees it, this system has enriched economic elites while harming working-class people who are rooted in older industrial economies — all while failing to deliver on the ultimate goal of liberalizing non-democratic countries like China and Russia.</p><p>From this perspective, Vance does not see the United States’ decision to defend <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3265802/secretary-of-state-antony-j-blinken-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iii-jap/#:~:text=We%20stand%20together%20with%20Ukraine,independence%2C%20their%20territorial%20integrity%20respected." target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;“the principles at the heart of the international rules-based order”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3265802/secretary-of-state-antony-j-blinken-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iii-jap/#:~:text=We%20stand%20together%20with%20Ukraine,independence%2C%20their%20territorial%20integrity%20respected.&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70d0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">“the principles at the heart of the international rules-based order”</a> in Ukraine as part of some high-minded and honorable policy. Instead, Vance sees it as a self-interested effort by economic elites to preserve a global order that advanced their interests while screwing over the type of people he represents in post-industrial Ohio.</p><p>As he once put it to me, “I think you have to rethink the entire project.”</p><br /><p><br /><b>In place of the rules-based</b> international order, Vance thinks the U.S. needs to chart a new, more nationalistic system where individual nations are solely responsible for their own security and economic well-being, and more insulated from global economic and military entanglements. According to Vance, the first step toward nudging the world in that direction is ending U.S. aid to Ukraine — which, as became clear this week, depends on convincing his Republican colleagues in the House to kill Johnson’s foreign aid package.</p><p>Vance has marshaled several different arguments against additional U.S. aid to Ukraine, prompting his opponents in both parties to argue that he’s <a href="https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-if-your-position-is-being-cheered-by-vladimir-putin-its-time-to-reconsider-your-position/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;merely carrying water&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-if-your-position-is-being-cheered-by-vladimir-putin-its-time-to-reconsider-your-position/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70d0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">merely carrying water</a> for Vladimir Putin and other authoritarian leaders. (Vance has, of course, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/sen-jd-vance-tells-jake-000323078.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;pushed back&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/news/sen-jd-vance-tells-jake-000323078.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70d0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70d0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">pushed back</a> against this characterization.)</p><p>When it comes to the specifics of the Ukraine bill, Vance has been pushing three main objections. In his New York Times op-ed last week, Vance argued that the current aid package — which would provide an additional $60 billion to Ukraine — would do little to shift the war in Ukraine’s favor. (Supporters of the current aid package have <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/courage-strength-optimism/2966259/backing-ukraine-help-not-hurt-us-deterrence/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;challenged this claim&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/courage-strength-optimism/2966259/backing-ukraine-help-not-hurt-us-deterrence/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70d0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70d0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">challenged this claim</a>.) Vance also argues that the U.S. lacks the manufacturing capacity to produce the volume of weapons that Ukraine would need to win the war.</p><p>His last, and most explicitly partisan, objection stems from his preparations for Trump’s possible return to the White House next year. Vance has objected to a component of Johnson’s aid package — which proposes seizing Russian assets under the REPO Act and freezing the current sanction regime against Russia in place — on the grounds that it would <a href="https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/vance-memo-warns-repo-act-could-pose-dire-consequences-for-the-western-financial-system/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;tie a second-term Trump’s hands&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/vance-memo-warns-repo-act-could-pose-dire-consequences-for-the-western-financial-system/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70d0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70d0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">tie a second-term Trump’s hands</a> in his negotiations with Russia. This isn’t the first time that Vance has objected to Ukraine aid by invoking Trump, either. In February, when the Senate was debating its own version of the aid package, Vance told his colleagues that locking spending levels in place <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/02/12/congress/vance-foreign-aid-bill-could-get-trump-impeached-00140939" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;could create a hidden mechanism&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/02/12/congress/vance-foreign-aid-bill-could-get-trump-impeached-00140939&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70d000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb70d000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">could create a hidden mechanism</a> for Democrats to impeach Trump in his second term.</p><p>Yet Vance’s efforts this week to persuade his Republican colleagues in the House of these specific objections are, in many respects, secondary to his broader goal of shifting the Republican paradigm on foreign policy. As Vance explained to me during our conversations, this larger project goes beyond injecting some “realism” — or, as his critics would call it, “isolationism” — into the foreign policy debates on the right. In a more expansive sense, Vance sees the debate over Ukraine aid as a proxy for the debate over the direction of what he openly calls “the American empire” — and, by extension, of America as a whole.</p><p>“The really interesting debate that is happening between the establishment right and the populist right is [about] challenging the premise … that things are going really well,” Vance told me. On the one side, establishment Republicans believe that the American empire is trending in the right direction; populist Republicans believe that the American empire is on the verge of collapse. The establishment points to falling poverty rates around the world; the populist right points to falling birth and life expectancies at home.</p><p>“There’s just this desperate effort to just argue that everything’s gone well,” Vance told me, “and, man, I just don’t buy it at all.”<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

But as the GOP conference attempts to stay focused on Election Day, the ouster effort led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) is shining a new spotlight on the posturing.</p><p>About half of the more than two dozen House Republicans interviewed for this story said they had noticed signs of senior colleagues trying to earn chits for a possible rise in the leadership ranks. The very fact that his own members see rivals scheming to replace him before an ouster vote puts Johnson’s shaky standing with his conference on stark display — though it also raises serious questions about whether Scalise, Emmer or Jordan can make a successful second run at leading the at-times ungovernable conference.</p><p>Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), a former chair of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said the posturing extends beyond those three members, pointing to favor-currying by “people that might even surprise you.” He declined to name names.</p><p>While colleagues are closely watching Scalise, Emmer and Jordan, the biggest scrutiny is falling on Scalise as Johnson pushes forward on a foreign aid package that could trigger a vote on his removal. Scalise is seen as the biggest threat to Johnson, not simply because he’s the House GOP’s No. 2. He earned more support in October’s frenetic leadership fights than Emmer or Jordan, and it’s clear that he’s still interested in the top spot.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351172627112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>For some Republicans, it’s enough to bring on flashbacks to his fraught relationship with former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Suspicion of Scalise appears highest among GOP lawmakers who closely observed the McCarthy-Scalise dynamic.</p><p>“Scalise has been knifing him since the beginning,” one House Republican said of Johnson, speaking candidly on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Scalise has brushed off the private chatter, though he didn’t answer directly when asked if he’s ruled out a challenge to Johnson in the future — saying that he isn’t “worried about what happens next year” and emphasizing the importance of Election Day.</p><p>“Anybody that’s talking about what titles they want for next year is really not focused on what’s right in front of us,” Scalise added.</p><p>Allies of Scalise strongly argue against this and say that he and Johnson, as two Louisiana delegation-mates, have a good relationship. And unlike Emmer or Jordan, Scalise voted with Johnson last week to bring down a conservative-backed amendment to government surveillance law that would have added a warrant requirement for certain uses of the spy power.</p><p>The Republicans who sense maneuvering among potential future conference leaders point to subtle attempts at patching up political vulnerabilities — like courting once-unfriendly reporters, patching up problems with Trump world and turning former foes inside the conference into allies. At other times, though, possible contenders to replace Johnson go the typical route of touting strong fundraising and extending campaign-trail goodwill to vulnerable members.</p><p>Brazenly angling for the top spot, after all, would risk alienating backers and inviting criticism. Importantly, Emmer and Jordan have also dismissed the idea of challenging the speaker.</p><p>“I’m not running against him,” Jordan said when asked whether he is weighing a challenge against Johnson after the November elections, adding: “We should keep Mike Johnson in charge of the House.”</p><p>Yet even if Johnson survives Greene’s threat, frustration with him is growing stronger among members even outside of the usual suspects in the Freedom Caucus. While many of them don’t care for a repeat of last fall’s punishing speakership race, some privately say they are waiting until November’s post-election leadership battles to show their disappointment with Johnson.</p><p>A growing group of Republicans predict Johnson will either step aside or be thrown out if they lose the majority this fall, though he may have a stronger chance at holding on if the GOP manages to keep the House.</p><p>“The votes aren’t there for him,” said a third House Republican, who said they presumed Johnson would step aside after Election Day.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351047360112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Johnson’s allies have largely dismissed the idea that his days in charge are numbered regardless of the November election results. In an interview last month, Johnson said he hasn’t “even considered” his plans for seeking the top spot again and has not “given thought to” the possibility of whether or not members of his current leadership team will try to challenge him for the top spot. </p><p>Asked if he trusts his leadership team, the speaker emphatically replied “oh, yeah.”</p><p>Jordan’s allies, however, are especially vocal that the conservative Freedom Caucus co-founder should consider trying to replace Johnson at the top, particularly if Republicans lose the chamber come November.</p><p>“I like Jim Jordan. I think he should have a shot at being speaker. I think he will have a shot at being speaker after the election. But to move it up now — I’m just not sure it makes any sense,” said Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.).</p><p>One senior House Republican, also granted anonymity to speak candidly, told POLITICO: “Jordan is challenging him, period. I know what I am talking about. </p><p>“The question is what does Scalise do?” this member added. “Johnson is so damn clueless he will run again regardless. But Jordan is in — he can beat Johnson, but not Scalise, in my opinion.”</p><p>Despite Jordan’s public disavowal of any interest in a challenge, he has raised some eyebrows since Johnson has become speaker with some remarks he’s made in front of colleagues behind closed doors, according to three GOP members — including remarks along the lines of “the way I would’ve done it is” or what the speaker “<a href="https://twitter.com/Olivia_Beavers/status/1745096564752765105" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;should have done&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/Olivia_Beavers/status/1745096564752765105&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7100004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7100005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">should have done</a>.” Those types of remarks, these people noted, didn’t happen in front of other members when he disagreed with McCarthy on policy matters.</p><p>“You’re seeing Jordan just get really adamant … about certain things that he wouldn’t have been under McCarthy,” said a second senior House Republican.</p><p>“It is totally false that Jim Jordan is positioning for anything and [he] is 100 percent behind Mike Johnson,” said Jordan spokesperson Russell Dye.</p><p>There are also some members who profess to not see the positioning going on — though some say they wouldn’t be surprised either.</p><p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if they did. But I can’t say that I have [seen it],” said Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), a former Freedom Caucus chair.</p><p>Eyes are also on the No. 3. A third senior House Republican strongly denied that Scalise would undermine Johnson and pointed a finger directly at Emmer, professing to have personally observed the whip undercut the speaker.</p><p>Emmer was blocked last year from ascending to the gavel — after Scalise and Jordan failed — in part because the former president was rallying against him. Now he and Trump have worked to patch over differences, with the presumptive presidential nominee publicly endorsing Emmer on Truth Social earlier this month. CNN first reported on that development and signs of broader posturing.</p><p>And beyond Scalise, Emmer and Jordan, there may be more aspiring candidates waiting to try to take on Johnson. Biggs isn’t the only one who senses that.</p><p>“Every single person thinks that they are speaker material. And so, do I think that all those people are right now kind of watching and circling a little bit? Yes,” said another House Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He’s been presented with social media posts calling for officials to “lock him up.” He’s been told, to his face, that he’s “very selfish and self-serving.”</p><p>And through it all, Trump has been required to remain seated, not gesturing, not talking and not using his phone. He has not even been allowed to adjust the temperature a few degrees in a courtroom he described as “freezing.”</p><p>To top it off, some of those people — including the one who called him selfish and said she outright dislikes him — are now members of <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/04/18/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/what-we-know-about-the-jury-00153194" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the jury of 12 Manhattanites&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/04/18/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/what-we-know-about-the-jury-00153194&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7130002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7130003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the jury of 12 Manhattanites</a> who will decide whether to convict him of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal a sex scandal.</p><p>The jurors also include an Upper East Side woman who works as a speech therapist, a retired man originally from Lebanon who enjoys fly fishing, a father of three who works as a security engineer, and a woman originally from California who works in product development. The group, which represents a cross-section of Manhattan, has been commanded by the judge, Justice Juan Merchan, that they must put their feelings about the former president aside, and all 12 of them have vowed to do so.</p><p>Those dozen people were finalized Thursday after a third day of proceedings that amplified the trial’s unprecedented challenges: The defendant is not just a former president, but is also a man with a social-media megaphone who is quick to weaponize it.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/dc/55/c39259094009886144d88c82d169/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2147911225" /><br /><p>At the start of the day, the trial lost two jurors who had been seated earlier in the week. Both expressed concerns about their identities being publicized.</p><p>Prosecutors, meanwhile, accused Trump of repeatedly violating a gag order in the case — most flagrantly, they said, when he claimed on social media on Wednesday that “undercover liberal activists” were “lying” to get on the jury. The prosecutors renewed their request for Merchan to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/04/16/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/gag-order-motion-for-contempt-00152465" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;hold Trump in contempt&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/04/16/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/gag-order-motion-for-contempt-00152465&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7130004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7130005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">hold Trump in contempt</a> and fine him.</p><p>One of the jurors excused Thursday, an oncology nurse from the Upper East Side, called the court the day before to say that “after sleeping on it overnight, she had concerns about her ability to be fair and impartial in this case,” the judge said.</p><p>The woman said in court Thursday that she was alarmed about what had been publicly reported about her, and that her friends and family informed her that she had been identified as a juror.</p><p>"I don’t believe, at this point, that I can be fair and unbiased and let the outside influences not affect my thinking in the courtroom," she said.</p><p>Another juror was dismissed after prosecutors said a man with the same name had been arrested in the 1990s for tearing down right-wing political posters, calling into question whether the man had been truthful in his answers during jury selection. The man also expressed “annoyance” at the amount of information published about him this week, Merchan said.</p><p>It wasn’t clear why the man was excused from the jury — or even whether he is, indeed, the same person whose arrest prosecutors uncovered.</p><p>When the trial opened on Monday, prosecutors told Merchan that Trump had, in recent days, violated the judge’s gag order three times. The gag generally prohibits Trump from publicly commenting on potential witnesses, jurors and other people involved in the case. On Thursday, the prosecutors raised the issue again with more alarm, saying that Trump has breached the restrictions seven more times. They called the former president’s behavior "ridiculous."</p><p>The prosecutors want Trump fined $1,000 per violation. Merchan has not acted on the request, but has scheduled a hearing on the issue next Tuesday.<br /></p><br /><p>Assistant district attorney Christopher Conroy described the “most disturbing” new example as a social media message Trump posted on Wednesday evening quoting a Fox News host as saying, "They are catching undercover Liberal Activists lying to the Judge in order to get on the Trump Jury."</p><p>Conroy also flagged several examples of Trump having posted on his campaign website and on his social media accounts about his former lawyer Michael Cohen, who is expected to be a key witness for the prosecution. The posts contained pictures of Cohen, and some contained links to a New York Post article calling Cohen a “serial perjurer.”</p><p>Trump lawyer Emil Bove disputed that Trump had violated the gag order, saying his “responses are political in nature.” Bove also disputed that Trump reposting others' public comments violates the gag order.</p><p>In perhaps the final indignity of the day, Trump was deprived of a fresh set of targets when prosecutors denied him and his lawyers the routine step of disclosing the first three witnesses they intend to call when they begin presenting their case, likely next week.</p><p>“Mr. Trump has been tweeting about the witnesses,” prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said. “We’re not telling him who the witnesses are.”</p><p>“I can’t fault them for that,” Merchan replied.</p><p>Though Trump attorney Todd Blanche offered to prevent Trump from posting on social media about the witnesses, Merchan told Blanche, “I don’t think you can make that representation.”</p><p>Blanche pressed further, asking that the witnesses’ names be disclosed only to attorneys, but Merchan again rebuffed him, saying: “I’m not going to order them to do it.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kennedy Jr.'s wealthy but relatively obscure running mate, Nicole Shanahan, contributed $2 million to their long shot White House bid in March, preventing the campaign from running into the red for the second month in a row.</p><p>The contribution, included in a fundraising report filed Thursday, comes as Shanahan has otherwise largely retreated from public view.</p><p>While Kennedy has hosted several fundraisers and two campaign rallies since naming her his running mate in March, Shanahan’s contributions to the campaign so far have overwhelmingly been financial. The wealthy Silicon Valley tech attorney and entrepreneur has mostly been “getting a grasp on the policies Bobby’s involved in,” said communication director Del Bigtree.</p><p>“She’s doing podcasts and discussing issues with people and having think tank sessions,” Bigtree said in an interview this week. “She’s focused on learning and studying.”</p><p>But Shanahan’s self-funding is keeping the campaign in the black.</p><p>While the campaign raised $5.3 million in March, it also spent $4.4 million and reported an additional $224,000 of debt for security expenses. It had just over $6 million cash on hand at the end of the month, but also reported $1.5 million in debt, all owed to Gavin de Becker &amp; Associates for private security services.</p><p>Itemized donations to the campaign also ticked up slightly after Kennedy announced Shanahan as his running mate. But her personal contribution — coming from her own wealth, in part from a divorce settlement from Google cofounder Sergy Brin — accounted for far more money to the campaign. Shanahan has never before run for or held public office.</p><p>Shanahan has now contributed more than $6 million to Kennedy’s campaign efforts since last summer after she gave $4.5 million to two different super PACs backing him.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351180596112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Shanahan has not participated in campaign events or interviews with Kennedy following her announcement launch event on March 22, though she has posted a short video about the U.S.’s Southern border and has done podcast interviews with independent content makers Rick Rubin, a former music producer, and Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford professor who was an outspoken critic of Covid-19 lockdowns.</p><p>She is scheduled to host her second-ever campaign event with Kennedy on Zoom for Earth Day on April 22.</p><p>Shanahan, previously a reliable donor to the Democratic Party, has also faced public pressure to withdraw from the Kennedy ticket.

He said he’s encouraged other people who know Shanahan to do the same.</p><p>“I think it’s going to be an uphill challenge, but I don’t think the door’s totally closed. Otherwise I wouldn’t have written the letter or tried to get people to talk to her,” Khanna said in an interview on Capitol Hill, adding he’s known her for about five years as a climate activist. “I think if she hears from a lot of people, she changes [her mind] by the summer.”</p><p>Khanna said that Shanahan also gave him a courtesy call before the announcement, where she explained she wanted to join the campaign because “she was frustrated with the DNC, that they weren’t allowing new voices.”</p><p>Kennedy’s campaign is relying on Shanahan’s money to keep up with costs. Five-figure campaign consultants and staff salaries for the campaign totaled $814,000 in March. Typically, Kennedy’s largest campaign expenditures have been for his private security services and their travel, but that amounted to just $414,000 last month.</p><p>Bigtree earned $20,000 in March through his LLC.

Democratic outside groups are also working to dig up dirt on Kennedy and his newly named running mate, Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneur and philanthropist.</p><p>In the Biden campaign’s latest move, members of the extended Kennedy clan “pledged our unwavering support” to Biden over Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said RFK Jr.’s sister Kerry Kennedy in a speech at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Thursday. So far, the Kennedys, descendents of one of the most beloved Democratic presidents, have largely shunned their family member, some of them calling his campaign “dangerous.” </p><p>But the formal endorsement, which featured more than a dozen Kennedy family members, takes that push back a step further. </p><p>“We want to make crystal clear our feeling that the best way forward for America is to re-elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to four more years,” Kerry Kennedy said, who led a chant of “four more years.” Her brother, however, went unmentioned by name in her speech. </p><p>Biden, for his part, called it “an incredible honor to have the support of the Kennedy family.” He noted that a bust of Robert F. Kennedy, one of his “heroes,” is currently displayed inside the Oval Office, alongside Martin Luther King, Jr. </p><p>But the formal endorsement, which will feature more than a dozen Kennedy family members, takes that push back a step further.</p><p>The Kennedy family’s endorsement is part of a broader, all-party effort to attack the RFK Jr.’s campaign, which Biden aides and Democratic allies see as a threat to his election. Democrats acknowledge that in a race that could be decided by thousands of votes in a few states, they’re not taking any chances with third-party candidates, which include Kennedy, Cornel West and Jill Stein.</p><p>“He’s a guy with a famous last name, so he can be dangerous and he can pull voters, who are not particularly engaged, away from Joe Biden,” said Pat Dennis, president of American Bridge, one of the Democratic groups focused on opposition research against RFK Jr.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350145122112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>But Dennis said that when voters “are educated about who [Kennedy] is, about his conspiracy-minded nature, then [Donald] Trump is in trouble” because then those voters are then drawn to the former president, instead of Biden, so “that’s why we’re helping to make sure the electorate knows who RFK Jr. is.”</p><p>Kennedy, for his part, said he was “pleased” his family is politically active, “it’s a family tradition.”</p><p>“We are divided in our opinions but united in our love for each other,” Kennedy <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1780977861064794359" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;said in a post on X&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1780977861064794359&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7630001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">said in a post on X</a>, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>It’s not just Democrats who are concerned about Kennedy’s ability to affect the race.

That prompted Kennedy to claim that Trump’s team <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/15/rfk-jr-trump-running-mate-00152272" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;asked him to consider joining the former president’s ticket&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/15/rfk-jr-trump-running-mate-00152272&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7630002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7630003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">asked him to consider joining the former president’s ticket</a>. A Trump adviser denied Kennedy’s story.</p><p>Kennedy’s impact on the race is clear in public polling. Kennedy consistently polls in the high single digits in national surveys, as he siphons off support from both Biden and Trump. For example, a <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3894" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;late March Quinnipiac poll&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3894&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7630004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7630005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">late March Quinnipiac poll</a> found Biden leading Trump by 3 points in a head-to-head matchup. But Trump took a 1-point lead over Biden when third-party candidates were added, who drew 13 percentage points of support. However, it was primarily Stein and West who hurt Biden.</p><p>“It’s important for a well-resourced campaign to leave nothing on the table, and that includes talking to voters who are pausing and curious about Kennedy, but who are actually going to find him unpalatable when they find out who he is,” said Margie Omero, a Democratic pollster. “A challenge would be to have people ascribe whatever qualities they want to him as a third-party candidate.”</p><p>“The issue here is leaving nothing to chance,” Omero added.</p><p>Kennedy has leaned into his family’s history as a means for attracting support.

Ilhan Omar.</p><p>The 108 arrests stemming from trespassing charges were authorized by Columbia President Minouche Shafik, and came a day after she testified before the House Education subcommittee for a hearing called “Columbia in Crisis: Columbia University’s Response to Antisemitism.”</p><p>“The students that were arrested were peaceful, offered no resistance whatsoever, and were saying what they wanted to say,” NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban said during a news conference Thursday evening. </p><p>“Columbia University’s students have a proud history of protest and raising their voices,” Mayor Eric Adams said. “Students have a right to free speech but do not have a right to violate university policies and disrupt learning on campus.”</p><p>There was no violence or injuries, Adams added. </p><p>Columbia also suspended students whom school spokesperson Samantha Slater said on Thursday were “participating in the unauthorized encampment.” Omar’s daughter was also among students at Columbia affiliate Barnard College <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/rep-ilhan-omars-daughter-students-suspended-barnard-college-refusing-l-rcna148445" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;suspended for&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/rep-ilhan-omars-daughter-students-suspended-barnard-college-refusing-l-rcna148445&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7660000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7660001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">suspended for</a> refusing to leave an encampment in support of Gaza, and the NYPD confirmed she had been arrested. </p><p>“This morning, I had to make a decision that I hoped would never be necessary,” Shafik wrote in a universitywide email Thursday in explaining her move to use NYPD force to clear the encampment, which she wrote “severely disrupts campus life, and creates a harassing and intimidating environment for many of our students.”</p><p>The hostility that gripped the Upper Manhattan campus marked the largest escalation yet for a university that has been engulfed in tension since the onset of the Israel-Hamas war, and were the Ivy League school’s largest crackdown on student activism since protesters shut down the campus in 1968.</p><p>The scene unfolded as college campuses throughout the country have become a locus for friction around the war.

Saturday is the <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2024/04/15/youve-got-to-go-on-00152355" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;25th anniversary of the Columbine shooting&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2024/04/15/youve-got-to-go-on-00152355&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7690000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7690001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">25th anniversary of the Columbine shooting</a>, and, in just a few weeks, it will be two years since the mass shooting in a Buffalo supermarket. Soon after that, families in Uvalde, Texas, will mark the second anniversary without their loved ones.</p><p>“We know history is a teacher of when we need to be prepared, and when we need to have our resources ready to go to deploy. And so the urgency of the meeting is to ensure that the team, the coordination, and that our approach is in place so that we’re prepared before tragedy strikes,” said Gregory Jackson, the Office of Gun Violence Prevention’s deputy director.</p><p>President Joe Biden announced the new guns office last fall after his administration had exhausted the executive actions they could take to address the gun violence epidemic. Biden had already signed historic legislation, 2022’s Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, as well as more than two dozen orders on guns.</p><p>Biden tasked the team with finding new executive actions and implementing the BSCA, which has resulted in the most <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/11/biden-gun-show-firearms-rule-00151655" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;sweeping expansion&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/11/biden-gun-show-firearms-rule-00151655&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7690002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7690003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">sweeping expansion</a> of firearms background checks in decades. He also asked the office to coordinate support for survivors, families and communities in the wake of a mass shooting — from emergency trauma care and mental health support to federal assistance for businesses and schools — in the same way FEMA responds to natural disasters.</p><p>It was Jackson’s job to create this first-ever federal protocol. He’s tested it out in real time, coordinating across agencies after shootings in Maine, Chicago and Kansas City.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath, the Department of Justice will deploy law enforcement and FBI victim services, as it previously has. The new White House team will now also jump into action, calling mayors, local legislators and governors to map out victim needs.</p><p>Jackson will then convene an emergency call with federal agencies to figure out which resources are available and how quickly they can deploy them. Sometimes he’ll fly out to the scene to offer extra support on the ground, serving as the primary contact so local officials don’t have to worry about keeping track of a web of federal agencies.</p><p>“A lot of the resources are now synced up together, and we’re just able to move a lot faster to support communities,” Jackson said. “What would’ve taken weeks to do, we’re now able to do within hours or days.”</p><p>In Lewiston, Maine, for instance, the administration helped set up a family and victim assistance center. Because Lewiston has a large deaf community, they made sure there were sign language interpreters present. There was a similar effort after the Kansas City shooting to ensure resources were targeted to the sizable Latino community.</p><p>Jackson, who nearly died after he was shot as an innocent bystander in D.C. 10 years ago, has also drawn on his own experience as a gun violence survivor and as an advocate leading the <a href="https://www.cjactionfund.org/policy-agenda" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Community Justice Action Fund&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cjactionfund.org/policy-agenda&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7690004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7690005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Community Justice Action Fund</a>. Listening to the communities amid an emergency response is one thing, he learned over the last few months, but hearing from local officials, families and activists who have survived past tragedies can be even more helpful.</p><p>To that end, the White House has held listening sessions in recent months with community members from Buffalo, Uvalde, Parkland, Florida, Highland Park, Illinois, and other mass shooting sites, as well as people affected by gun violence events that haven’t garnered the same level of media attention — such as Baltimore’s Brooklyn Homes, where 28 teens were shot in 2023.</p><p>Jackson and his team learned that in Buffalo, for instance, there was unique trauma among seniors and grocery store clerks who were expected to return to work just days after 10 people were killed in their store. In Baltimore, teens needed extra support that local groups weren’t equipped to provide. And in the Newtown, Connecticut, tragedy, Sandy Hook Elementary teachers were sent back to the classroom without any additional resources to deal with the trauma.</p><p>“I think in almost every one of these tragedies, we’ve seen the lack of guidance and support for local leaders, local officials, and local communities,” Jackson said. “And these are all resources that these agencies have at the federal level. They just haven’t all been coordinated.”</p><p><b><i>Like this content? Consider signing up for POLITICO’s West Wing Playbook newsletter.</i></b><br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

They also target Iran’s steel industry and automotive companies that supply the country’s military.</p><p>In a statement, Biden said the sanctions were a response to “one of the largest missile and drone attacks the world has ever seen against Israel.”</p><p>“I’ve directed my team, including the Department of the Treasury, to continue to impose sanctions that further degrade Iran’s military industries,” Biden said.</p><p>The U.K. <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/us-uk-slap-sanctions-iran-linked-to-israel-attack/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;also imposed new sanctions on Iran&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/us-uk-slap-sanctions-iran-linked-to-israel-attack/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb76b0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb76b0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">also imposed new sanctions on Iran</a> in coordination with the U.S. Biden said other “allies and partners have or will issue additional sanctions and measures to restrict Iran’s destabilizing military programs.”<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350978905112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>In the U.S., the sanctions come as Congress is debating additional ways to financially punish Iran for its attack on Israel. The Republican-led House this week passed a series of sanctions bills, including a bipartisan measure that would target China’s purchase of Iranian oil.</p><p>The Treasury Department said the latest sanctions target 16 people and two companies that enable Iran’s production of unmanned aerial vehicles, including the manufacturers of engines that power the type of drones used in last weekend’s attack against Israel.</p><p>The sanctions also include five companies that provide materials to Iran’s steel industry, which the Treasury Department said generates billions of dollars each year for the country.</p><p>In addition, the Biden administration said it was imposing new export controls aimed at restricting Iran’s ability to obtain commercial grade microelectronics.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the administration was “taking swift and decisive action to respond to Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel.”</p><p>“We’re using Treasury’s economic tools to degrade and disrupt key aspects of Iran’s malign activity, including its UAV program and the revenue the regime generates to support its terrorism,” Yellen said in a statement.</p><p>Iran <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/13/iran-israel-attacks-00152116" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;last weekend&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/13/iran-israel-attacks-00152116&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb76b0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb76b0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">last weekend</a> launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation for a deadly Israeli airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Syria.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan is expected to lead the conversation for the Biden administration. Sullivan’s Israeli counterpart, Tzachi Hanegbi, is heading his nation’s delegation.</p><p>Those attending from the Israeli side also include Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer as well as representatives from the Israel Defense Forces and Israeli security agencies, said the Israeli official, who like the senior U.S. official was granted anonymity to detail an unannounced meeting before a readout is released.</p><p>The initial plan had been to hold the discussion in person in Washington, but Iran’s weekend attack — which featured more than 300 missiles and drones that Israel, the U.S. and other nations shot down — postponed a trip.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350968857112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>During the group’s first virtual meeting on April 1, the U.S. and Israel found themselves far apart on the issue of civilian protection for Rafah. Israel said they could move Palestinians out of the city in four weeks, while the American side such a migration would require four months. Since then, working groups have gotten together to find a compromise between the two positions.</p><p>Thursday’s meeting will test if the U.S. and Israel are finding common ground. The meeting “will be a follow up … where they will discuss progress made, among other things,” said the senior administration official. <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/18/us-israel-gaza-rafah-offensive" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Axios first reported&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.axios.com/2024/04/18/us-israel-gaza-rafah-offensive&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb76d0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb76d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Axios first reported</a> on the meeting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

However, tensions remain high after Iran’s unprecedented missile-and-drone attack on Israel. One government official suggested sites may have been targeted by drones.</p><p>The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>IRNA said the defenses fired across several provinces. It did not elaborate on what caused the batteries to fire, though people across the area reported hearing the sounds.</p><p>In particular, IRNA said air defenses fired at a major airbase in Isfahan, which long has been home to Iran’s fleet of American-made F-14 Tomcats — purchased before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.</p><p>The semiofficial Fars and Tasnim news agencies also reported the sound of blasts, without giving a cause. State television acknowledged “loud noise” in the area.</p><p>Isfahan also is home to sites associated with Iran’s nuclear program, including its underground Natanz enrichment site, which has been repeatedly targeted by suspected Israeli attacks. However, state television described all sites in the area as “fully safe.”</p><p>Dubai-based carriers Emirates and FlyDubai began diverting around western Iran about 4:30 a.m. local time. They offered no explanation, though local warnings to aviators suggested the airspace may have been closed.</p><p>Iran later announced it grounded commercial flights in Tehran and across areas of its western and central regions. Loudspeakers informed customers of the incident at Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran, online videos purported to show.</p><p>Iranian state television began a scrolling, on-screen alert acknowledging a “loud noise” near Isfahan, without immediately elaborating.</p><p>Hossein Dalirian, a spokesman for Iran’s civilian space program, said on the X social media platform that several small “quadcopter” drones had been shot down. It wasn’t immediately clear where that happened or if it was part of the ongoing incident in Iran.</p><p>Meanwhile in Iraq, where a number of Iranian-backed militias are based, residents of Baghdad reported hearing sounds of explosions, but the source of the noise was not immediately clear.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Trump had urged Mehta to sideline the lawsuits in part because he argued that disclosing details about his claim of presidential immunity could undermine his criminal defense.</p><p>But Mehta rejected that argument.<br /></p><br /><p>“[B]oth cases center on the former President’s actions in the lead up to and on January 6, 2021,” Metha agreed. “But Defendant overstates the significance of that factual overlap in the present posture of these matters.”</p><p>Trump has used his claim of presidential immunity as a shield from both criminal charges and lawsuits related to his actions in the chaotic weeks leading up to Jan. 6, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol. The Supreme Court will hear arguments next week on the immunity issue in the criminal case.</p><p>Mehta, however, said questions about Trump’s immunity in the context of his lawsuits can be addressed without requiring him to admit to any particular actions he took on Jan. 6 — from the drafting of his speech at the Ellipse that day to his tweets and public commentary — that might also be relevant to his criminal case.</p><p>Only one category of evidence in the civil case might implicate Trump’s Fifth Amendment rights, Mehta continued: his tweets from Jan. 6. But Mehta said he will not require Trump to admit whether he drafted any particular tweet, alleviating the concern that he might be forced to admit to conduct that could incriminate him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This is the one I want , Safety , Drywall , and Security [sic],” Riza wrote in an email, according to the complaint. “One project but we all can eat ! Please show to him before Event it will start when he's in office."</p><p>Riza, along with two other defendants, has donated to several prominent political figures in the neighborhood over the years.</p><p>Thursday's deal was hashed out between Riza and the office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought charges against six people over the summer alleging they steered tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars to the mayor’s campaign in the form of public matching funds.

That 8 percentage point margin is much smaller than at this point in the 2020 election. At that time, Biden was leading Trump by 23 percentage points among young people.</p><p>Biden’s margins widen when the pool is restricted to registered and likely voters. But, still, his 19-point lead over Trump among the voters under 30 who are considered likely to turn out is significantly smaller than his 30-point advantage this time four years ago.</p><p>Biden holds wide leads among likely voters who are non-white and women — up by 43 points and 33 points over Trump, respectively. He trounces Trump among the higher-educated set, leading the presumptive Republican nominee by 47 points among likely voters who are college graduates and 23 points among college students.</p><p>But Biden’s margins are far slimmer — or nonexistent — among other key demographics. He’s just 6 percentage points ahead of Trump among likely voters who are young men, according to the poll, and just 3 points ahead among white voters. When it comes to young people without college degrees, Biden and Trump are in a dead heat.</p><p>And though there are fewer of them, Trump’s younger voters are far more enthusiastic about the former president than their peers who are backing Biden, according to the poll. More than three-quarters of Trump voters said they enthusiastically support the Republican, while just 44 percent of Biden voters said the same.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/a2/a9/795a34814047993d209a27790410/election-2024-trump-55155.jpg" /><br /><p>The nationwide survey of 2,010 Americans aged 18 to 29 was conducted between March 14 and 21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Respondents were surveyed online after being randomly recruited to join a panel maintained by Ipsos Public Affairs.</p><p>“Make no mistake, this is a different youth electorate than we saw in 2020 and 2022, and young voters are motivated by different things,” John Della Volpe, polling director for the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics and an expert on polling young voters, said in a statement.</p><p>“Economic issues are top of mind, housing is a major concern — and the gap between young men's and young women's political preferences is pronounced,” he said.</p><p>The Harvard youth survey <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/07/voter-age-biden-trump-2024-election-00150923" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;is the latest to show Trump rising among the nation’s youngest voters&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/07/voter-age-biden-trump-2024-election-00150923&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb77a0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb77a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">is the latest to show Trump rising among the nation’s youngest voters</a>, another potential warning sign for Democrats whose presidential candidates have long been able to successfully court that bloc.</p><p>Indeed, while Biden’s lead is 26 points among likely voters ages 25 to 29, it falls to 14 points among those ages 18 to 24.</p><p>Still, the survey shows some reasons for concern for Trump, too. Biden’s overall lead grows if the former president is convicted in any of his criminal trials, with the Democrat jumping up 10 points among all young adults, 8 points among registered voters and 9 points among likely voters.</p><p>But third-party candidates threaten to erode Biden’s margins, putting more data behind a scenario Democrats have long feared. Biden would still win the youth vote with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West and Jill Stein on the ballot, the Harvard pollsters said, but potentially only by a handful of points.</p><p>And Biden’s job approval rating among younger adults is just 31 percent.</p><p>Meanwhile, Biden’s approach to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war could cost him at the ballot box. More than half of young adults, 51 percent, support a permanent cease-fire in Gaza — which Biden has stopped short of calling for — a viewpoint that cuts across party and demographic lines. Just 10 percent of young people oppose it.</p><p>Just a fifth of young Americans believe Israel’s response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 incursion is justified, while 32 percent believe it is not.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I have to get mine. Where are my crumbs?” Pearson allegedly told retired NYPD sergeant Michael Ferrari, who filed the lawsuit, and another staffer, according to the complaint. </p><p>After that, per the complaint, coworkers would refer to Pearson as “Crumbs.”</p><p>The suit is the second to be filed this year accusing Pearson of harassment and retaliation and provides further clues into the inner workings of the Mayor’s Office of Municipal Services Assessment that he led. News of the suit was <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/04/17/mayoral-aide-timothy-pearson-sued-by-second-retired-sergeant-over-sex-harassment-controversy/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;first reported&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/04/17/mayoral-aide-timothy-pearson-sued-by-second-retired-sergeant-over-sex-harassment-controversy/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb77e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb77e0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">first reported</a> by the Daily News.</p><p>In the complaint, Ferrari alleges he witnessed or was told of Pearson sexually harassing female colleagues in the services assessment office — including a retired sergeant who filed a separate lawsuit in March — and was eventually tasked by a higher-up with monitoring Pearson’s behavior around women in the office.</p><p>“The hostile work environment surrounding the sexual harassment carried over to every member of the team regardless of gender,” the complaint read.</p><p>Ferrari — who is not claiming he was a victim of Pearson’s unwanted advances — alleged that Pearson often bragged about punishing members of the NYPD who he felt slighted by, which the suit contends was a way to intimidate staff at the services assessment office.</p><p>After a blowup with another leader in the office over allegations of sexual harassment, Ferrari said in the complaint he asked to transfer out of the services assessment unit and was subsequently demoted back to patrol. With his career derailed, he alleges, he retired from the NYPD.</p><p>The city’s Law Department said it would review the suit once it is served.</p><p>“We hold all public servants to the highest standards,” mayoral spokesperson Kayla Mamelak Altus said in a statement.</p><p>In the past, the mayor’s team has declined to provide basic information about Pearson’s role in city government.</p><p>On Nov. 3, for example, former mayoral spokesperson Charles Lutvak told POLITICO that Pearson did not work for the municipal services assessment office at all, despite both <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/12/eric-adams-administration-problems-00140897" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1713395822368,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1713395822368,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/12/eric-adams-administration-problems-00140897&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-ee59-dff0-a7de-fe7d5c130001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;past reports&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-ee59-dff0-a7de-fe7d5c130000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">past reports</a> and claims in two lawsuits now indicating Pearson played a leading role at the office.</p><p>Wednesday’s complaint, for example, indicates Pearson had a large corner office opposite Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Phil Banks at 375 Pearl St., the location where Adams has also maintained <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/13/mayor-adams-secret-office-lower-manhattan-high-rise-00045504" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a clandestine office&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/13/mayor-adams-secret-office-lower-manhattan-high-rise-00045504&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb77e0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb77e0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a clandestine office</a>.</p><p>Wednesday’s suit follows a related set of allegations raised in a March court filing.

You can’t pack a theater so full of people that no one can reach the fire exits without being trampled. In the physical world, these kinds of noise control and fire safety regulations uneventfully coexist with our First Amendment free speech and free assembly rights. They’re accepted as common-sense ways to keep us safe and preserve our sanity.</p><p>The same ideas can be applied to social media. By reverse engineering the noise and lack of crowd control that has overrun social media platforms, we can make the internet a more peaceful, reliable, less polarizing place.</p><p>And we can do it without the government policing speech. In fact, Congress does not have to do anything. It doesn’t even need to touch Section 230, the now infamous 1996 law that gives social media platforms immunity for the harmful content — from healthcare hoaxes to election misinformation to Russian and Chinese state-sponsored propaganda — that has created a world of chaos and division, where so many people don’t believe even the most basic truths. Instead, <i>the Federal Trade Commission and other consumer protection regulators around the world could enforce the contracts the platforms already have with their users.</i></p><p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, already promises users that it will enforce “community standards” that prohibit, among other abuses: inciting violence, “inauthentic” behavior such as setting up fake accounts, promoting suicide, bullying, hate speech, graphic or sexually explicit content, human exploitation and misinformation “that will cause imminent physical harm, health-care misinformation and misinformation about elections and voting.”</p><p>This list could more accurately describe all the categories of harmful content that have flourished on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>Most of the other platforms have similar lists of prohibited content and contracts with their users. These terms of service do not say, “We take our role seriously, but our algorithms encourage a lot of that content, and the volume of it flowing through our platform makes it impossible to prevent much of it from being posted even if we wanted to. Sorry.” Yet that’s basically what they say whenever they embark on another session of their yearslong apology tours testifying in front of Congress and similar tribunals around the world.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6345958140112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>The FTC is responsible for protecting consumers, including by suing companies that defraud them by violating the terms of a contract. Section 5 of the law creating the FTC declares that “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce … are … unlawful,” and empowers the commission to prevent companies from using such deceptive practices. The commission’s Policy Statement on Deception defines “deceptive” practices as a material “representation, omission or practice that is likely to mislead a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances.” In fact, the FTC has already taken action against Facebook for violating the privacy promises it makes in those same terms of service. It imposed a $5 billion fine in 2020.</p><p>The FTC’s website explains that “the Commission may use rulemaking to address unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition that occur commonly, in lieu of relying solely on actions against individual respondents.” Accordingly, the commission could enforce the content promises in these terms of service by promulgating a rule that any digital platform must prominently and clearly spell out in its terms of service what content it will allow and not allow — and then, as with their privacy assurances, make sure they keep those promises.</p><p>Spelling out those terms prominently and clearly would mean posting a large chart on a prominent screen listing all possible offending content and requiring the platform to check a box if the content is prohibited or allowed.</p><p>In keeping with First Amendment restrictions on government regulation of the content of speech, it would be up to the platforms to decide which content to prohibit — that is, to check or not check each box. A platform that wants to allow misinformation or hate speech could choose to do so. However, it would have to level with its users in that prominent chart by declaring that it is choosing to allow it. This would give a stricter platform a competitive advantage in the marketplace; a platform that has to declare in large print that it allows misinformation or hate speech is likely to turn off many potential users and advertisers.</p><p>First Amendment protections would prohibit the government from forcing the platforms to prohibit hate speech or most misinformation. Yet nothing stops the proprietors of a platform from making those decisions by defining what it considers hate speech or harmful misinformation and screening it out. That’s called editing, which is protected by the First Amendment when private parties, not the government, do it. In fact, editing is what the authors of Section 230 had in mind when they wrote it; it shielded platforms from liability not only for what they <i>do</i> allow but also for what they do <i>not</i> allow. This is why the provision was titled the “Protection for ‘Good Samaritans’ Act.” Let’s make those who run the platforms be Good Samaritans.<br /></p><br /><p>This would be a logical and content-neutral way for the commission “to address deceptive practices” — in this case an obvious and widespread failure by the platforms to deliver on the promises made in their contracts with users. The FTC rule would require that the platforms prove that their declarations about what content they will not allow are real — not aspirational. As with inspectors checking enforcement of building codes, making sure there is adequate exit access in a crowded theater or catering hall, the FTC rule should require that each platform demonstrate that it has the capability to screen the volume of its content<i>.</i></p><p>If this means that a platform has to cut its profit margins to hire thousands of people to screen all content before it is posted, or that it has to drastically lower the volume of users or the amount of content that they can post, so be it.</p><p>We should have learned by now that the ability for anyone anywhere to send any kind of video or text message instantly to everyone anywhere may be a technology marvel, but it is anything but a positive development. A quieter, less spontaneous online community is superior to the alternative of people live-streaming a murder, summoning rioters to the Capitol or, as happened in the days following the Hamas attack on Israel, Facebook, X and TikTok posting hundreds of lurid videos — quickly receiving millions of views worldwide — of the terrorists celebrating as they committed unspeakable atrocities.</p><p>The promises from the Silicon Valley witnesses at these now routine congressional hearings to work harder and do better are meaningless because they do not manage the volume and velocity of what gets posted. Instead, they apologize for being overwhelmed by the fire hose of content that is the essence of their business model — and the controllable but uncontrolled source of their bonanza profits.</p><p>To enforce this capability requirement, the FTC would have independent auditors review the platforms’ content on a regular basis to determine whether they have proved capable of keeping their promises. The audits should be publicly available.

Kennedy and Robert Kennedy and speechwriter extraordinaire to Lyndon B. Johnson. Although he was only in his 20s and 30s at the time, Dick Goodwin was author of some of the most memorable speeches in American history, inventing phrases that came to define the era, from the “Alliance for Progress” to the “Great Society.”</p><p>That history is part of the tale Goodwin tells in her new book, <i>An Unfinished Love Story: A Personal History of the 1960s</i>. The book is based on files she pored through with her late husband in the final years of his life, and it weaves his experiences together with her own. As a young PhD candidate at Harvard, Goodwin worked in the White House under Johnson. It was the height of the tumultuous 1960s and she almost lost her White House job during Vietnam by co-authoring an article titled, “How to Remove LBJ.” Worried about how he’d be seen by history, Johnson later asked Goodwin to help write his memoirs, launching her career as a presidential historian.</p><p>I talked to Doris Goodwin this week about the book. We covered everything from life inside the Kennedy and Johnson White Houses to the strange tale of RFK Jr., to the advice she gave Biden.</p><p><i>The following has been edited for length and clarity.</i><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/bd/e7/8e6a35a74f72a2747ef583f079c1/mag-hirsch-kearnsgoodwinqa-couple.jpg" /><br /><p><b>You say this book means more to you than anything you’ve ever written. Obviously, that has a lot to do with working on it with your late husband, Richard Goodwin, but is it also because of the extraordinary history you two lived through together in the 1960s, even though you didn’t meet until the decade was over?</b></p><p>That was really the great adventure of our lives: to relive the decade that meant so much to us, from beginning to middle to end, [while] trying to suspend our knowledge of how it ended, with the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy and the riots, and the antiwar violence in the campuses. In his last years it gave Dick a sense of purpose and joy to be waking up knowing we’d be working on this, and also allowed him to soften his feelings for LBJ, whom he had once loved and turned against because of the war. And somehow putting those resentments aside and remembering the heyday of the Great Society, was really important to him. The great thing working on the archive with him was that usually my presidents are dead and they never talk back to me. This time [the subject] was right across from me.</p><p><b>You and Dick were happily married for 42 years. But as the two of you dove into his trove of White House files you started having some serious fights about all that history. After John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Dick’s files revealed how fiercely JFK’s anguished brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, hated LBJ. RFK even suggested at one point that LBJ — the president who would later author so many Great Society programs to address poverty and racial injustice — had “no feeling for people who were hungry.” You were outraged by that, you said.&#xa0;</b></p><p>It really was upsetting. I was such a Johnson loyalist and he [Dick] was a Kennedy loyalist. … I eventually came to feel a great respect and appreciation for Bobby Kennedy but the idea that Johnson didn’t care about people who were hungry and had no empathy for them was just so wrong-headed. It was said that when JFK was killed and LBJ came into the presidency, Bobby couldn’t bear looking at him because it was a reminder that his brother wasn’t there. He didn’t go to Cabinet meetings. And then I began to understand a little more that conversation Dick had with him, when he was so sad and all those [Great Society] laws were passing, and Bobby said, “It’s just not fair. My brother had only three years.” Dick says to him, “Yeah, but Julius Caesar had only three years, and he’s remembered by history,” and Bobby comes back with, “Yeah, but it’s good to have Shakespeare write about you.” Bobby was funny.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/4e/9c/5bb4d412484c92cc50e025400acd/mag-hirsch-kearnsgoodwinqa-60s-grid.jpg" /><br /><p><b>And then of course a few years later Bobby is also assassinated, and his own family of 11 children is deeply traumatized. Several of those children go on to have troubled lives. One of these kids was Bobby’s second-oldest son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who’s become a conspiracy theorist and often seems to suggest that the political system is rigged against him.&#xa0;RFK Jr.’s decision to run against Biden is obviously something of a puzzle to his own family. You’ve written a lot about the Kennedys. Can you give us any insight into his character, where that psychology comes from?</b></p><p>I really wish I knew. I knew him when he was younger. I don’t know whether it’s psychology from the past or what he’s gone through. … All you can do is judge what he’s standing for. There’s a certain kind of anti-science approach, but his father loved learning and had a curiosity about science and literature. There was a sense of a broadening mind that his father stood for that is different from what young Robert Kennedy is standing for. It surprises me and perplexes me.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/69/86/b87d73014bcf901ff4eb93c8c183/mag-hirsch-kearnsgoodwinqa-selma.jpg" /><br /><p><b>The Biden campaign is in something of a state of some confusion right now. The president believes he’s not getting enough credit for his achievements. Have you advised Biden on this?</b></p><p>I just saw him at the beginning of his presidency. I remember talking to him about [Franklin Roosevelt’s] fireside chats, that it was a mode of communication that would fit his conversational style of speaking. And we talked about FDR and the Great Depression and all the laws that went on the books at that time. You could see he was thinking in those terms.</p><p><b>Did you give him any other advice?</b></p><p>He was just starting the presidency, so I really just gave him some advice on communication — that FDR adopted a means of communication that was different from JFK’s more soaring rhetoric. I really think that Biden and LBJ spoke more like FDR, who had a rule that he didn’t want words of more than one syllable if possible. He understood he was talking directly to the people.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/b6/69/206c94b74fb3b39cdf017f3d51ec/mag-hirsch-kearnsgoodwinqa-speech.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Perhaps one of Biden’s problems is that he doesn’t have a Richard Goodwin writing for him.</b></p><p>The funniest moment I think is when [presidential aide] Bill Moyers and LBJ are talking in the spring of ’64, and Johnson says, I need someone who is going to put sex and rhythm and music and great Churchillian phrases into my speeches [after which Goodwin was hired]. But great speeches depend not simply on the words but also on the moment in which they’re spoken. If Patrick Henry had said “Give me liberty or give me death” in the middle of a Chamber of Commerce meeting people would have thought it ludicrous, right? Great events allow somebody to rise to the occasion. Yet it’s also different today when you don’t have everybody listening to the speech in the same way and the pundits are talking about the speech even before it’s finished.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/b7/e5/c1d3c0554da19049b8b685747722/mag-hirsch-kearnsgoodwinqa-civilwar.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Your husband remarks at one point in the book that people have a grim view of the Johnson era today — with the Vietnam war, the assassinations of King and the Kennedys and the violence in the streets — but that what they miss is the exhilaration and sense of hope.</b></p><p>One of things I really hope is the book makes this younger generation feel there once was a time when young people really led the nation, when you think about those who joined the Peace Corps, who were marching against segregation and for the right to vote, the Freedom Riders, the sit-ins and the demonstrations, the beginnings of the women’s and gay rights movements. There was a belief they could make a difference. There was a sense that they wanted to be part of something larger than themselves. It’s a great feeling. It’s what I felt when I went to the March on Washington in August 1963.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/8d/9f/89b0f6c24c6882cda8cfd332f073/mag-hirsch-kearnsgoodwinqa-book.jpg" /><br /><p><b>&#xa0;You’ve said that if you had one issue you’d want to fight for today it would be voting rights. Nearly 60 years ago it was your husband who wrote the famous “We Shall Overcome” speech that set the stage for the Voting Rights Act of 1965. And yet here we are again, still fighting politically over this issue.</b></p><p>I know. The long view of history tells you that progress is a relay race. If you think about the 50s, it starts in some ways with Emmett Till’s mother, who wants people to see what was done to her son. So that then fires up Rosa Parks who’s sitting on the bus and thinks maybe she won’t go through with this — but then she remembers Emmett Till’s mother. So Rosa Parks stays there, goes to jail, and that brings on the Montgomery bus boycott. And then Martin Luther King becomes the leader of that, and so begin the sit-ins against segregation and the Freedom Rides. And it takes until 1964, after Birmingham and civil rights and LBJ coming into office, to get that filibuster broken. And yet that moment happens.</p><p>And now we see the slow diminution of that. It’s heartbreaking that it’s a fight that has to be fought again. LBJ said voting is the central right on which all other rights depend. [But] there are times in our country’s history where you go backward — and you have to catch up again and then move forward.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/0c/0c/b09850104086bcc1a34fe788822d/mag-hirsch-kearnsgoodwinqa-kennedys.jpg" /><br /><p><b>One of your husband’s extraordinary last acts of public service was to write Al Gore’s concession speech in 2000. In what was praised as a moment of eloquence and grace, Gore said that, while he strongly disagreed with the Supreme Court’s decision giving the election to George W. Bush, he was conceding “for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy.”&#xa0;If Dick had to write such a speech for the loser in 2024, what do you think would he write?</b></p><p>I hope he would write almost the same thing — which is this election has been fairly won or lost. These elections are so guarded that anyone talking about 2020 says it was probably the most secure election in history. Gore quoted the saying inscribed over the Harvard Law School library. [Ed: “Not under man but under God and law.”] That’s what every other person has done in our history. They thought they would have made a difference in the direction of the country and yet one after another after another has come out and made those statements.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/b8/cd/ad933a9140c9b584dbc365cc0277/mag-hirsch-kearnsgoodwinqa-wedding.jpg" /><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

The piece enjoyed an extended run on X, where everybody who hates NPR and everybody who worships it <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=berliner&amp;src=typed_query" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;queued up to debate it&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=berliner&amp;src=typed_query&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb78b0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb78b0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">queued up to debate it</a>.</p><p>But as is often the case when employers punish their workers, Berliner’s transgression was not as much about what he did (write an outside piece without permission) but what he said. Let’s not kid ourselves. He was docked a week’s pay for his message, not his conduct. If Berliner had, say, written a poem for the <i>New Yorker</i>, or reviewed a book for the <i>Washington Post </i>without first getting a sign-off from NPR, he might have gotten congratulations from his bosses or at the very worst, a polite scolding for not following the rules. Berliner’s real “crime” is that he trashed his own institution in public, and did it loudly, and when you do that in most places of employment, a sharp reprimand is sure to follow.</p> <p>Editors have, of course, been contending with increasingly contentious staffers over the past decades who take their grievances public. Social media has proved a powerful amplifier of their beefs.</p><p><br />Some observers might think the Berliner reprimand shows that fed up bosses are finally starting to crack down on rowdy employees. But that’s too generous of an interpretation. Berliner could have dumped bilge on NPR and still gotten a clean getaway if he had indemnified himself by bringing a posse of similar malcontents with him, as this <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/28/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc-newsroom-power-shift-00149408" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;previous column&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/28/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc-newsroom-power-shift-00149408&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb78b000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb78b000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">previous column</a> demonstrates.</p><p>When Chuck Todd ripped NBC News for having hired Ronna McDaniel as a paid commentator, he took his case to an NBC News show, <i>Meet the Press</i>, indicating that he had buy-in from other NBCers. Indeed he did, as they vocally seconded his protest of the hiring.</p><p>Another way to bring your posse with you is to launch your rebellion on your outlet’s internal Slack account. Newsroom staffers are natural complainers and fault-finders. That’s one of the reasons they chose the profession in the first place. If you assemble a newsroom of journalists, you can confidently predict an altercation unless you’ve got a lion tamer on retainer. It also benefits a protester to bring to the revolt an identarian complaint that includes race, sexual orientation, religion or gender. Bosses get wiggy when forced to parse an identity-based complaint. Unfortunately for Berliner, he couldn’t take that route.</p><p>We have learned in recent years that when staffers start shouting at the bosses on Slack or in a petition, the bosses squirm.

Coordinated Slack and social media posts on X give staffers new-found leverage in their tussles with management. How can you beat down a newsroom when everybody holding down a desk is shouting, “I am Spartacus”? It’s impractical to crucify your entire staff.</p><p>If Berliner had dropped his bomb after organizing like-minded colleagues at NPR to support him — or even enlisted a gaggle after publishing the broadside against his network — he would have remained untouchable. Bosses everywhere are good at admonishing individuals. But they wilt against numbers.</p><p>Perhaps Berliner didn’t assemble a posse because support for his anti-NPR views, so publicly visible and voluble on the outside, is not common inside the broadcaster, even though Berliner told NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo that he has “<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/16/media/npr-suspends-editor-uri-berliner-who-called-out-left-wing-bias/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a lot of support&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nypost.com/2024/04/16/media/npr-suspends-editor-uri-berliner-who-called-out-left-wing-bias/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb78b0012&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb78b0013&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a lot of support</a>” inside the newsroom. It’s likely that Berliner thought the best way to achieve maximum impact for his anti-NPR diatribe would be to intentionally draw an official rebuke from the network and thereby become a martyr and then resign in protest. It doesn’t require a Ph.D. in game theory to see that Berliner, who was <a href="https://findingaids.smith.edu/repositories/2/resources/1123" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;born in 1956&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://findingaids.smith.edu/repositories/2/resources/1123&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb78b0014&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb78b0015&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">born in 1956</a> and now qualifies for Medicare, got what he wanted. Surely a book contract and speaking engagements will follow.</p><p>Most of Berliner’s complaints about how progressive groupthink has tarnished NPR track well under scrutiny. What does not is his observation that only “in recent years” has the network stopped resembling “America at large.” Even a casual NPR listener knows that what Berliner says about NPR has been true for at least 40 years, and surely for the 25 years he has worked there. NPR knows its listeners’ preconceptions well, and has indulged them for a long time. What took Berliner so long to discover the self-evident?</p><p>Steve Oney, whose history of NPR, <i>On Air</i>, comes out next year, says in an interview that the network has never been good at managing its own press.</p><p> <br /></p><br /><p><br />“They think they’re small time when in fact they’re big time,’ he says, and it shows whenever the network finds itself in the news.

Roh Moo-hyun, from the liberal party, died of suicide while he and his close circle were investigated for bribery. Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye were convicted and sentenced to prison over bribery and abuse of power. Yoon Suk Yeol, the current president of South Korea, played a key role in the indictment of Park Geun-hye as prosecutor general at the time, and his achievement catapulted him to the stardom he needed to run for the presidency.</p><p>With the U.S. now facing its first criminal trial of a former president, I called up Nathan Park, a fellow at the foreign-policy focused <a href="https://quincyinst.org/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1713301995071,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82d4-d747-a9be-ced69b5e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1713301995071,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82d4-d747-a9be-ced69b5e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://quincyinst.org/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-e8c1-d3bc-adfe-f8edad4a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Quincy Institute&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-e8c1-d3bc-adfe-f8edad4a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Quincy Institute</a> and a left-leaning Korea watcher, to ask how the U.S. can learn from Korea’s long history of locking up past leaders. Park, who is critical of the current Yoon administration, discussed the consequences of prosecuting leaders, how to prevent it from becoming a political weapon and why a future president should consider pardoning Trump if he does get convicted.<br /></p><br /><p>Once lauded as victories for democracy over corruption, the prosecutions have now thrust Korea into a new and paranoid era, with government officials riddled with fears of lawsuits and criminal charges. Even worse, it makes lawmakers afraid to admit fault for fear of their apologies being used against them in court.</p><p>“On a very ground level … you can sense it from government officials that they’re freaking terrified to do anything outside of the manual,” Park says. “Everything they do is extremely defensive.”</p><p><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p><p><b>Park Geun-hye’s impeachment and conviction was seen as a democratic win at the time — but now it seems like we’re stuck in a loop of non-stop prosecution of the opposition party. What have the political implications been like since her sentencing?</b></p><p>What happened afterward is pretty unique and pretty wild. What it did was it legalized politics. Not legalized as in going from illegal to legal, but legalized as in politics became sort of lawfare. It became more about, Did you break the law? Did you not? Can you prove this in court? Can you not? And the people who are the most powerful in this lawfare are the prosecutors. What ended up happening is that the Prosecutor General — Yoon Suk Yeol — the most powerful prosecutor of them all, became the president on the strength of that. He became a political star first by prosecuting Park Geun-hye.</p><p>On a very ground level, I have been feeling — just because I do a lot of work and business in Korea — you can sense it from government officials that they’re freaking terrified to do anything outside of the manual, and everything they do is extremely defensive. Korean government used to be a very, very efficient thing relative to other governments. Now it’s still more efficient than other governments, but you can feel that the gears are slowing down a little and a lot of it is the fact that even minor officials are completely terrified of doing something that is outside of the manual and potentially prosecuted for some reason or another.</p><p>The other thing that happened is that Yoon Suk Yeol is also afraid of the same thing happening to him. So the other side of the coin is that you end up having an administration that never compromises and never admits any fault. And I think you really see that in the aftermath of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/30/world/asia/south-korea-itaewon-crowd-crush-victims.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Itaweon disaster&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/30/world/asia/south-korea-itaewon-crowd-crush-victims.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7900000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7900001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Itaweon disaster</a>, which was this really unbelievably awful thing. And what happens is nobody apologizes, nobody resigns. They just generically say that, “Oh, we’re sorry this happened.” This is all sort of like the litigious mindset where the moment you admit fault you feel like you’re exposing yourself to a potential liability.</p><p><b>Is that because once you do expose yourself to liability, people will try to prosecute you and use that against you in court?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Yeah, because now, instead of normal politics, the expectation is that everything will be reduced to a lawsuit and indictment. So in that sense, one could argue that prosecuting leaders was a negative.</p><p><b>Do you think that politicians see prosecution as an opportunity now? Do they see the prosecution of a president as an opportunity to gain strength?</b></p><p>Oh, absolutely. In Yoon’s case, it was absolutely the direct motivation. He leveraged these prosecutions to become a political star himself.</p><p>I have a hard time imagining that this could happen in the U.S., just because of the way our justice system is structured. But imagine someone making a gubernatorial run or presidential run on the strength of being a strident opponent or prosecutor of Trump.</p><p>Or you could do it on the other side too: Someone who decides that, OK, this is going to be my star moment, and I’m going to be the next star Republican politician and try to leverage it that way.</p><p><b>We’ve now seen three former Korean presidents out of four be investigated. One died of suicide, and the other two were sentenced to prison. How concerned are you that the process has become politicized and used as a tool of retaliation?</b></p><p>I think there is a right way and wrong way of doing this. The short version is that if the legal process is rigorous and the crime seems very plain and obvious, then there is more legitimacy behind it. And the more it seems like a fishing expedition, the more it seems like, “OK, we struck out on this theory. So let’s try another theory. And another theory, another theory.” If it looks like that, that undermines democracy, because it’s starting to look like persecution.</p><p>And I think that’s what really distinguished the investigation of Roh Moo-hyun versus the investigation of Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak. The crimes of Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak were really obvious. They weren’t hard to understand. And it was pretty well established what they did in terms of a paper trail. Whereas the Roh Moo-hyun case is more like, there <a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20231129000761" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;really wasn’t any evidence connecting him directly to any bribes&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20231129000761&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7900002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7900003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">really wasn’t any evidence connecting him directly to any bribes</a>. And it was fairly clear that it was driven by sensationalism. And it was driven by a desire to humiliate Roh Moo-hyun.</p><p>People are not stupid, they can sense if a prosecution is driven by legitimate needs versus a desire to target somebody. And the difference is when the legal process is done in a rigorous way versus sort of this sensationalistic fishing expedition sort of way.</p><p><b>How about the post-Park Geun-hye era? I know Yoon at one point wanted to investigate the past Moon administration and has been cracking down on Lee Jae-myung, his main political rival. And in recent months, there also have been murmurs of wanting to impeach Yoon by his opponents. Do you think there’s more of a weaponization and distrust against prosecutions of politicians since Park’s conviction?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I think it’s still in flux. It’s kind of interesting, but I do think they still trust the legal system. And when someone is vindicated, then they take it seriously. Like, for example, Lee Jae-myung was in danger of getting arrested pretrial, and the judge denied the arrest warrant. And that was a big moment because in people’s minds, that sort of indicated that the criminal case against Lee Jae-myung was pretty weak. Whenever that kind of news plays out, people see that as the legal system working, it’s sorting out the people who committed crime versus people who did not.</p><p><b>Why do you think the Korean public still has so much trust in the courts, despite all the political chaos that the prosecutions of presidents might cause?</b></p><p>When you look at just the straight-on level of trust in government in OECD surveys, South Korea actually scores really low, much lower than the U.S.</p><p>My basic thesis is this: Koreans overall have much lower trust in government than Americans would. But I think that lower trust is actually the flipside of high expectations. Koreans have a high standard of what the government is supposed to do. And when you meet that standard, I think Koreans will lend a great deal of trust, regardless of the fact that their baseline of trust is rather low. I think that’s what goes on with Koreans.</p><p>And I think that works the same way as I described: If the process of prosecuting a president seems vindictive and without real standards, then it will be seen as a type of persecution. If the process of prosecuting the president meets the high standard that people set, then people accept the fact that this is how justice is carried out.</p><p><b>Donald Trump is on trial now. How does the U.S. avoid the politicization of prosecutions that has happened in South Korea?</b></p><p>I think the process should be rigorous, and there needs to be a clear distinction between people who have threatened democracy versus other categories of crimes and violations. Basically, I think that there’s a danger in this “whatabout-ism” in the sense that the attempt to end democracy on January 6 is seen as the same thing as Hunter Biden’s laptop. When you start giving both sides the same coverage when they belong to different categories altogether, I think that is what invites the legalization of politics. It incentivizes people to dig up whatever small little dirt you can dig up and say, “No, you're just as bad as we are.” So I think there needs to be a clear denunciation and clear demarcation of what is so truly offensive that it merits prosecution against the president versus not.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350968717112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><b>Who should we trust to make that distinction though?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Now I’m traveling in a more idealistic direction, but my general sense is that people are not dumb and an engaged and civil society can see this through. They can understand what’s real and what’s not as long as they’re fed good information.</p><p><b>What should the U.S. learn from South Korea as it embarks on the prosecution of a former president?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I think the prosecution of Trump has been handled well. Moving cautiously and making sure that everything as a legal matter is perfectly tied out — I think it’s very good.</p><p>In my view, it seems pretty clear that Trump’s side is the one that’s putting on this clown show. And on the other side, the prosecution is conducting themselves with professionalism. That really will be the most important thing.</p><p>The same thing happened with Park Geun-hye. Park Geun-hye’s attorneys were clown shows. Rather than trying to make a serious argument, they would show up draped in a flag and give a long speech about how everybody’s communist. She already lost credibility as a general matter, but she could not — much like Trump — get good, professional attorneys to represent her. So in the eyes of the public, she lost pretty quickly.</p><p>I also want to touch upon one thing: The fact that Korea prosecutes a lot of presidents is usually coupled with the fact that they’re pretty quickly pardoned in just a few years. There are differing opinions on this, but I sort of fall on the side that maybe it’s not such a terrible thing. There is sort of a ritualistic aspect to the law, right? You go through the process of going through a trial, being sentenced and going to prison like everyone else, and you’re not above the law. You go through this process to feel some level of catharsis but you don’t permanently alienate the people who supported that president by giving them a pardon and not letting them die in prison basically.</p><p><b>Is that something the U.S. should emulate?&#xa0;</b></p><p>It is. It wouldn’t be so terrible, especially because U.S. criminal law is relatively unique in the sense that the penalties are incredibly harsh. This is a very strong criticism I have as a criminal lawyer, that everything in the U.S. is punished with way too much prison sentence. So especially with Trump, if some of these charges stick, I don’t see him getting anything less than like a 20-year term because they’re serious charges. He’s not a young man, obviously that means he’ll die in prison. And I don’t think you want to go down that road. It would be fine for him to, for example, be convicted, maybe spend three to four years in prison. If his health deteriorates, maybe pardon him and let him at least have his final days look dignified.</p><p><b>And that’s what South Korea did with Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye, right?&#xa0;</b></p><p>That is definitely what they did, especially with Park Geun-hye. Park Geun-hye’s health was genuinely bad and she also had genuine fans that if she should die in prison, she would have been a martyr. I mean, she's already a martyr a little bit but even more so than now.<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

Then, the official said, “You know, a lot of people inside the administration ask that same question. Sometimes they ask it on the first day. Sometimes they ask it six months later.”</p><p>I have an answer for them: There is no Biden strategy for Iran.</p><p>If he wants to end the growing chaos in the Middle East, he might want to come up with one.</p><p>The Islamist regime in Tehran is, by many measures, at the root of much of the destabilization across the Middle East and more of a threat to U.S. interests than ever before. Iran is on the verge of obtaining a nuclear bomb. Its proxy militias are spreading mayhem outside its borders. It has stomped out internal revolts, and — as shown by its recent attack on Israel — the regime’s ballistic missile program is going strong.</p><p>But for most of Biden’s time as president, his aides’ No. 1 goal hasn’t been to solve this puzzle, but to keep it off the president’s desk.</p><p>“The strategy is to keep it on low boil on all fronts — nuclear, regional, whatever. That’s been the approach for some time now,” said a second U.S. official, who, like several other people I spoke to for this column, is familiar with U.S. Middle East policy and was granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350978905112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>People in Washington have good-faith disagreements on how to define “strategy,” and many use the term generically. I’ve heard plenty of policymakers grumble about how documents labeled as strategies aren’t truly strategies. But those are abstract debates that often fail to address urgent and concrete foreign policy challenges.</p><p>I’ve come to believe that if the end goal of your effort isn’t to solve a problem, then you don’t have a strategy.</p><p>So when policy wonks use words like “containment,” “de-escalation,” “deterrence” and “risk management” to describe Biden’s approach to Iran, I hear only tactics, not strategies.</p><p>He believes Iran is a problem, but doesn’t appear to have a coherent plan for how to solve it.</p><p>During Barack Obama’s presidency, the administration wanted to solve the problem of Iran’s growing nuclear program. It also had a way to reach that goal: sanctions and diplomacy combined, an effort it inherited from George W. Bush’s team.</p><p>The strategy worked, and <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/foreign-policy/iran-deal" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the Iran nuclear deal was born&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/foreign-policy/iran-deal&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7940008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7940009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the Iran nuclear deal was born</a>.</p><p>Many observers said the deal wasn’t good enough, and some questioned what Obama’s real strategy was about.

Another challenge: China and Russia, which once cooperated with the U.S. on certain Iran policies, <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-axis-of-evasion-behind-chinas-oil-trade-with-iran-and-russia/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;are now helping Tehran evade U.S. sanctions&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-axis-of-evasion-behind-chinas-oil-trade-with-iran-and-russia/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb795000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb795000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">are now helping Tehran evade U.S. sanctions</a>, in part because of their own tensions with America.</p><p>Maybe the administration believes that some other strategy will have an <i>nth</i> order effect that will lead to a lasting change in Iran.</p><p>That appears to be one reason why, even in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Biden and his aides are still pursuing their grander vision of <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/09/09/us-saudi-india-uae-railway-deal-middle-east-europe" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;“regional integration” for the Middle East&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.axios.com/2023/09/09/us-saudi-india-uae-railway-deal-middle-east-europe&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb795000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb795000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">“regional integration” for the Middle East</a>.</p><p>This is an actual Biden administration strategy. The problem it ostensibly aims to solve is friction between Israel and Arab states, through a variety of economic, security, diplomatic and other arrangements. The combined aerial defense mechanisms that downed the Iranian missiles and drones targeting Israel this past weekend illustrated the nascent idea.</p><p>The U.S. hopes to see Saudi Arabia and Israel establish diplomatic relations, Washington and Riyadh enter a security pact, and Israel agree to a pathway for a Palestinian state. These pieces all depend on the others, and the people pushing them might as well buy a lottery ticket.</p><p>White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson pointed to elements of this regional integration strategy in a comment for this column.</p><p>“We don’t do policy by bumper stickers,” Watson said. “We focus on actually degrading Iran’s capabilities, while strengthening those of our partners and allies.”</p><p>One could generously call regional integration an Iran strategy, because by putting Iran’s regional adversaries, in particular the Saudis and the Israelis, on the same side, that certainly raises the regional pressure on Tehran.</p><p>I’m not that generous.</p><p>The Middle East is too fractured and complicated for the United States to hope that a regional integration strategy might some day, maybe, lead to a fundamental change in Iran.

The attack was a retaliation for an airstrike by Israel earlier this month that killed a top general with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus. But Haass believes Tehran has miscalculated and will come to regret its decision to shift from its longtime strategy of using proxy forces in places like Syria and Iraq into launching a direct attack on civilian areas in Israel, which has only rekindled sympathy for Israelis.</p><p>“The Iranians have lost control of the narrative,” Haass says.</p><p>Haass, the author of multiple books about foreign policy, retired as president of the Council on Foreign Relations last year after nearly 20 years. Previously he was director of policy planning at the State Department under Secretary of State Colin Powell in the run-up to the Iraq invasion in 2003. Today Haass publishes a <a href="https://richardhaass.substack.com/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;weekly substack&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://richardhaass.substack.com/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7980000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7980001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">weekly substack</a> called “Home &amp; Away.”</p><p>The question for the Middle East now is whether Iran’s miscalculation will be followed by an Israeli one.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350978905112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>“I like to quote Napoleon's dictum: When your enemies are making a big mistake, don't interrupt them,” he says. “Iran interrupted its enemy at a time when Israel was increasingly isolated and on the defensive, both internationally and in its relationship with the U.S.”</p><p><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p><p><b>With the attack by Iran, the Mideast crisis has become an even more complex situation, with a lot of moving parts. What would you be advising President Biden today?</b></p><p>I’m not sure I agree 100 percent that Israel shouldn’t respond. I think there are two big questions here. Should Israel respond? And if so, how should it respond? The Iranians essentially seem to want to say, “We’re even now, or tit or for tat.” And the president and the administration basically seem to be saying, “Okay, let’s not let things get out of hand.” So, as best I can tell, they are telling Israel at a minimum, "We won’t be with you if you do respond."</p><p><b>“You got a win. Take the win,” is what Biden reportedly told [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu in urging him not to counter-attack.</b></p><p>The only danger in that is whether deterrence has been weakened, because Iran crossed a significant threshold. The homeland-on-homeland attack was an unfortunate precedent. Which is not to say the right response would be to attack Iran’s homeland. There's a case for Israel responding in some ways along the lines of the action that may appear to have precipitated this: going after Iranian proxies, or elements of the Iranian security establishment outside of Iran. But I believe they would be wise to avoid an attack on the Iranian homeland.</p><p><b>But realistically, don't you think the Israelis, particularly a government as right-wing as this one, would view anything less than a response in kind — that is, a direct attack on Iran — as weak?</b></p><p>Certainly, there will be voices that will say that. Netanyahu will probably find himself caught, once again, between competing tendencies in his unwieldy coalition. I would argue for keeping the response very targeted. If Israel decides to act against Iran directly, I would suggest they target, for example, a factory where drones are being produced or a storage facility for drones. It ought not to be something that kills large numbers of Iranians.</p><p><b>One question is whether the Israelis may be thinking about attacking Iran’s nuclear program, which they have already targeted in various ways. Would that be appropriate?</b></p><p>The nuclear program in Iran is so distributed geographically and so protected that a response would have to be enormous. It still wouldn't destroy a significant portion of the program, though it could well set it back by a factor of months or a year or two. But the danger is that, in addition to whatever immediate retaliation would come from Iran, such an attack would provide justification for Iran going for nuclear weapons at a pace and to a degree that is not yet the case. The Iranians could say to the world: “Look, Israel is a nuclear weapons country, and they attack us with impunity. We therefore need nuclear weapons to stop that.” Attacking Iran’s nuclear program would not meet the thresholds or the criteria of proportionality, in my view.</p><p><b>It’s not clear what Tehran was trying to achieve with this attack. Was this a huge mistake by Iran, because until it happened Israel and the U.S. were on the defensive over the humanitarian issue in Gaza?</b></p><p>Yes, so much of the last 48 hours has been many of us just head-scratching over this. Why would Iran do what it did? I like to quote Napoleon's dictum: When your enemies are making a big, big mistake, don't interrupt them. Iran interrupted a situation when Israel was increasingly isolated and on the defensive, both internationally and in its relationship with the U.S., which had reached something of a nadir. At the United Nations, too, the narrative was working in Iran’s favor. Iran had so many other ways to respond effectively — perhaps using Hezbollah to militarize the West Bank or to do things elsewhere in the region. That has been the essence of Iranian national security policy for decades. So this seems to be a major strategic error on the part of Iran.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Perhaps that is what Biden was referring to — the strategic victory as well as Israel’s success in knocking down the missiles and drones.</b></p><p>Yes, the Iranians have lost control of the narrative. And even worse, they've introduced a new narrative, which like Oct. 7 casts Israel as the offended party. What Iran has done is throw Bibi Netanyahu the lifeline of lifelines that allows him to change the narrative. Now it’s about Iran — and Iran is an issue that, unlike Gaza, unites Israelis.</p><p><b>There's been a lot of self-congratulation in the last 48 hours about the effectiveness of Israel’s defense shield, with help from the U.S., and extraordinarily from Jordan as well, in shooting down 99 percent of the attack projectiles. But as I understand it, Iran deliberately did not fire off some of its best missiles. What do you make of that?</b></p><p>It was as if they were going through the motions of retaliation for what happened in [Damascus] Syria, rather than trying to really do something that would be militarily significant. I mean, it almost looks like a compromise. They didn't throw everything they had at it. It looks almost as though it was designed to fail. And then they were so quick to have their mission at the U.N. declare that this concludes things. It’s almost as though, for whatever domestic reason, they had to be seen as responding, but it was more of a political response than a military one.</p><p><b>What does that tell you? Was this about satisfying Iranian public opinion? Are the mullahs concerned about the domestic weakness of the regime?</b></p><p>It tells me that there may be differences between the IRGC and other factions. It’s quite possible the IRGC was demanding a [hard-line] response but others in Iran didn't want it to lead to an all-out conflict. Sometimes compromises that make no sense are the result of competing factions. Because again, on its merits, it makes very little sense to me why Iran didn't simply go with its normal playbook of indirect responses, perhaps targeting a Jewish or Israeli target halfway around the world. I was actually much more worried about them funneling more arms into the West Bank. That to me was a more frightening prospect.</p><p><b>Let's talk about how Biden and his administration have been handling this crisis overall. With the election seven months away, Biden’s under an extraordinary amount of pressure on the Palestinian issue. Would you say this is unprecedented?</b></p><p>Heretofore, if presidents paid a political price, it was for not being sufficiently pro-Israel. What's different now is that Biden is paying a political price for being “too pro-Israel.” So what's unprecedented is that, given the views of younger Americans — Americans of color and larger numbers of Muslim and Arab Americans — the domestic politics of the Middle East have changed. It's now become two-sided, not one-sided, which actually makes it harder for presidents. Biden is the first to learn this the hard way.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Before Oct. 7, the Biden administration was discussing normalization with Saudi Arabia but there wasn’t much attention to the Palestinians. In fact, Biden seemed to be going along with the approach of the previous administration, the so-called Abraham Accords, which basically sidelined the Palestinians. Then after Oct. 7, Biden and his team rediscovered the two-state solution, but they don't seem to be pushing that very hard.</b></p><p>There are four issues of contention with Israel and [the Biden administration] has focused mainly on two. First, humanitarian aid flows. And second, the Israeli use of military force and the lack of sufficient effort to avoid civilian casualties. But missing has been the issue of settlements on the West Bank — either land expropriation or settlement activity — and the other is the political content of a peace process. I'm largely fine with the first two. … But the real oversight, it seems to me, has not been to confront Israel on settlements and to articulate in detail what the United States believes ought to be the parameters of a political process. Of course, right now, neither Israel nor the Palestinians are [ready to negotiate a state]. But sometimes in diplomacy, you put forward ideas not to negotiate but to stimulate a process that will lead to political changes that will allow negotiations to happen.</p><p><b>Do you think that if either this Israeli government or a successor government could address the Palestinian issue, there might be reason for hope in terms of a larger Middle East peace structure — especially with the prospect of Arab normalization and so forth?</b></p><p>It's a long shot at best, but I refuse to give up on it. I’m a firm believer that it’s not just the Palestinians who need a Palestinian state, it’s Israel too. I have no illusions about the odds, and how long this could take and how difficult it would be and so forth. But I really do worry about the consequences of drift, about the idea of one-state “non-solution.” I really worry, not simply that you get a generation of even more radical Palestinians, but that it poses real challenges to Israel's Jewishness or democratic status or both. I think that's bad for Israel. I think it's terrible for the U.S.-Israel relationship. I’m not naïve, but if I could paraphrase [Winston] Churchill, I think a two-state solution is the worst possible solution, except for all the others.</p><p><b>You worked for the administration of President George W. Bush, and you left not long after the Iraq invasion in 2003. How much would you say the United States is still paying for its own errors in the Middle East going back to the Iraq war?</b></p><p>That's a good question. The principal strategic beneficiary of the Iraq war was none other than Iran. And one of the things that struck me the other day when the missiles and drones were being shot at Israel was, look where they were coming from. They were coming not just from Iran but also from Yemen and Iraq. This is the new Middle East. This is the Greater Iran. And to me, that was a reminder of how the Iraq war so imbalanced the region in Iran’s direction. So yes, we are and will continue to pay a real price for the strategic blunder that was the Iraq War.<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

None of the hundreds of projectiles launched at Israel hit a major target. </p><p>So, what was the point? </p><p>The latest crisis to erupt in the region left many longtime analysts wondering what Iran’s real intention was — whether the direct attack was mainly a face-saving exercise or a genuine effort to escalate — and whether the United States can still manage to prevent what it’s been trying to avoid for more than six months, a full-scale regional war.</p><p>Israel and Iran have been involved in a gradual, tit-for-tat escalation since Oct. 7. On April 1, the tensions worsened dramatically when Israel — retaliating for attacks on Israeli citizens allegedly orchestrated by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps along the Syrian border — destroyed an Iranian consulate building in Damascus, killing Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior IRGC commander, and seven other IRGC officers.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350970320112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, declared afterward that Israel would be “punished,” according to the state-run IRNA news agency. And the Iranian response on Saturday — a direct hit on Israel launched from Iran — marked a dramatic and very dangerous departure for Tehran, which until now has preferred to operate mainly through proxies in Lebanon, Syria and elsewhere around the region.<br /></p><br /><p>“There is a greater willingness to run risks by Iran than ever before,” said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the right-leaning Foundation for Defense of Democracies and an expert in Iran’s missile capabilities. “Until now, Iran had never directly targeted Israel from Iranian territory in an overt and attributable fashion,” said Taleblu. “The strike also was the first ballistic missile attack from Iranian territory against a defended target.”</p><p>“Iran wanted to break the taboo of targeting Israeli territory,” he said. “After being able to support the October 7 terrorist attack and orchestrate a multi-front proxy campaign against Israel and not have to pay the price, there's no doubt Tehran was tempted to press its advantage.”</p><p>Until now Tehran has signaled that it doesn’t want an all-out war, having <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/18/iran-proxies-middle-east/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;restrained its Hezbollah ally&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/18/iran-proxies-middle-east/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb79d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb79d0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">restrained its Hezbollah ally</a> in Israel’s north from launching more than sporadic token attacks. But “Iran's government appears to have concluded that the Damascus strike was a strategic inflection point, where failure to retaliate would carry more downsides than benefits,” said Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350970702112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>At the same time, Vaez added, Tehran’s choice of weaponry was cautious. “They could have used a much higher number of projectiles, synchronized drones and missiles in a way that would have swarmed the air defense systems, and could have fired their new hypersonic missiles,” he said. “They clearly wanted something spectacular but not fatal.”</p><p>Officials said more than 99 percent of the drones and missiles were shot down and there was only one reported injury, that of a 7-year-old Bedouin Arab girl who was hospitalized.</p><p>“The matter can be deemed concluded," Iran's mission to the United Nations said in a post on social media platform X hours after the start of the operation late Saturday. "However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran's response will be considerably more severe."</p><p>U.S. President Joe Biden is now in the tricky position of persuading Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his hawkish war cabinet to restrain his response to avoid all-out war.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/d9/d8/cedcd22e499785264727cea336e6/biden-mideast-tensions-59507.jpg" /><br /><p>So far, Biden has aimed to deter Tehran by signaling that war with Israel also means war with the United States. In a statement, Biden said the U.S. military had “moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the course of the past week” in anticipation of the Iranian attack, and “we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles.”</p><p>While some Republicans called for a <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4592547-gop-senator-calls-for-us-retaliatory-strikes-on-iran/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;tougher U.S. response&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4592547-gop-senator-calls-for-us-retaliatory-strikes-on-iran/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb79d0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb79d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">tougher U.S. response</a>, even some longtime critics of Biden on the right praised the president’s careful approach.</p><p>“I have to give the Biden administration credit. They have responded better than they did when Jerusalem whacked Zahedi in Damascus,” said Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former CIA official and a Farsi-speaking scholar at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “When that happened, the White House was very quick to signal that the-Israelis-did-it-not-us; this time round, Washington ran towards Israel and has intervened on Israel’s behalf. This will induce greater Iranian anxiety.”</p><p>“Does Khamenei want to escalate against Israel? Yes. Does he want to escalate against the U.S.? No,” said Gerecht. “Unfortunately for the clerical regime, Israel is going to respond directly against it. They have to. The only open question is the magnitude. We are in an escalatory spiral that likely favors Israel more than Tehran in great part because the White House chose not to sit this out and now will be unable to change its commitment to Jerusalem.”</p><p>Even so, Biden <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/14/biden-netanyahu-u-s-wont-join-counter-strike-iran-00152130" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;reportedly told Netanyahu&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/14/biden-netanyahu-u-s-wont-join-counter-strike-iran-00152130&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb79d0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb79d0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">reportedly told Netanyahu</a> during a call on Sunday that he won’t support an Israeli counterattack against Iran. (Biden has said he would coordinate a diplomatic pressure campaign against Iran by the G7 nations.) Biden reportedly told Netanyahu, “You got a win. Take the win,” according to Axios.</p><p>Despite that, Israel’s hard-line government is all but certain to continue its habit of defying Washington and strike back at Iran directly.</p><p>Netanyahu is “a leader who simply would not want to be remembered for not having responded to a direct attack from Iran,” said Hussein Banai, co-author of <i>Republics of Myth: National Narratives and the US-Iran Conflict</i>. He added: “A U.S.-led limited counterattack might be the best option in terms of escalation control; but that would mean getting to a consensus between Biden and Bibi, which may be hard to get at this time.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pérez, who attended Berkeley as an undergraduate, is used to the political spotlight, having served for four years as the state’s Assembly speaker. In an interview, Pérez told POLITICO that the student protest at Chemerinsky’s home crossed a line and described how campus leaders can do more to push back on what he sees as a dangerous surge in campus antisemitism.</p><p><i>This transcript has been condensed and edited for clarity.</i></p><p><b>Let’s start with the protest and confrontation at Dean Chemerinsky’s home in Berkeley. Do you think that the students stepped over the line by interrupting this dinner? Did the dean or his wife, Professor Catherine Fisk, step over the line in shutting down their remarks?</b></p><p>The students overstepped the line by disrupting a purely social event at a private home that was intended to celebrate the collective accomplishments of all the third-year law students. They telegraphed their opposition by calling for a boycott [in advance of the event] — that was fine, that was completely within their rights. But they did it in a horrific way, by <a href="https://twitter.com/sfmcguire79/status/1778037351723258077" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;employing an antisemitic caricature&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/sfmcguire79/status/1778037351723258077&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7a2000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7a2000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">employing an antisemitic caricature</a> of Dean Chemerinsky.</p><p>What’s interesting is Dean Chemerinsky is a nationally renowned First Amendment expert. And even though he was offended and hurt by the caricature, he defended their right to employ it. He has been the most consistent protector of First Amendment rights of students and student protests as well as others, even when he’s the target of it. </p><p>That’s different than what the students ended up doing, which is going to the house, disrupting the event, refusing to leave when asked to leave, confronting and asserting a First Amendment right that I don’t believe they had at a private home and then asserting that they had legal representation to do it. When Professor Fisk again asked them to leave and they didn’t, and then she confronted and tried to take away the mic, I’m sure in retrospect, she wished she would have handled that slightly differently. But that doesn’t forgive the act of the students disrupting and violating the private personal space and refusing to leave when asked.</p><p><b>What should be the consequences for these students?</b></p><p>So these are my individual opinions as somebody who believes in the right to protest, somebody who’s engaged in a lot of protest on the Berkeley campus, myself, and somebody who’s deeply concerned about campus climate and creating an environment that neither stifles free speech, but also doesn’t victimize and marginalize people. </p><p>Students broadly have been put on notice that if there’s further disruptions, folks will be turned over to Student Conduct and appropriate evaluations will be made. The question becomes whether the campus decides to engage in a student conduct investigation of this and whether the students involved will say they didn’t have fair notice that this crossed the line. That’s something that the campus has got to wrestle with. And I think the campus could come to either conclusion in defensible ways. They can come to the conclusion that students could have misinterpreted this because it’s hosted by the dean as being the same as anything on campus. And the campus can also come to the conclusion that my God, these are third-year law students at one of the top law schools in the country, and that they should have a better understanding about the consequences of their actions.</p><p><b>UC Berkeley, in particular, is in the national imagination as a place of protests — during the Vietnam War in particular. Do you feel like these current protests on campus are different than protests in the past? And if so, how?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I do think they’re different. </p><p>In each of those waves of previous protests, there was a notion from students that engaging in the protest had to serve the purpose of bringing people along in an area of debate, creating space to protest, but also to change minds and bring people in the direction of the justice that they were trying to seek. But there was also a concept of consequences associated with protest. If you want protest without consequence, what you really want is performance. And I think that right now we’re seeing folks engaging in disruption, without an understanding or appreciation for what consequences can come up with it, which I think can sometimes be performative.</p><p>Second, it feels like much of the protest now isn’t, at least from my perspective, effective in trying to move debate and create space to find a new common ground that aligns with the justice that the protesters are seeking. When it’s disruption for the sake of disruption, as opposed to civil disobedience to capture attention and create space for debate, I think it serves a fundamentally different [purpose].</p><p>When you look at the Free Speech Movement, it was about creating the space for all debate, including debate that one disagrees with. What we’ve seen of late is something very different, which is shutting down debate. Last year, at Berkeley Law School, student groups passed a series of resolutions, essentially banning debate, saying that holders of “Zionist viewpoints” would not be allowed to come [to their events]. That’s very different. It’s one thing to say any given organization shouldn’t be compelled to invite somebody who has a viewpoint that’s contrary to theirs. But to say that we want to ban a whole section of debate is inherently problematic in society. It’s particularly problematic in law school, and particularly problematic in a law school centered in a place that in many ways was the birth of the free speech movement on university campuses.</p><p>There has been a horrible spike in antisemitic activity across college campuses across the country, but particularly at elite universities, and there’s been a spike in the community more broadly as well. And I don’t think that we, societally and we, as university leaders, have done enough to push back against this spike in antisemitism.<br /></p><br /><p><br /><b>You talked about these flashpoints across the country, not just at Berkeley or the UCs. Why do you think this war has lit up so intensely on these elite campuses throughout the country?</b></p><p>I don’t know. I struggle with this. One theory is that there’s been significant funding of organizations on elite campuses to push back against the policies of the state of Israel. Second, you look at a student population that is generationally different in its worldview than folks of my age. I’m in my 50s. My fundamental experiences looking at the state of Israel are different than somebody in their 20s. Somebody in their 20s has grown up with an Israel that’s been disproportionately governed by the Netanyahu government, and a government that has been more conservative. Somebody of my age would’ve seen a variety of different expressions of leadership in Israel. I think it’s allowed for a certain shorthand that I think is ahistoric. </p><p>I think you can be, as I am, a supporter of the existence of the state of Israel and the ability of Israel to defend itself and a critic of the current administration leading Israel and the policies of the administration. You can be a critic of government there just like you can be a critic of government here. So I could be a critic of a Trump administration and a supporter of America, somebody else can be a critic of the Biden administration and still a supporter of America. We don’t seem to have a generational ability to afford that same duality with respect to viewing Israel.<br /></p><br /><p>But it goes further than that. What we’re seeing is stuff that we saw in the Chemerinsky caricature, which goes back to old antisemitic tropes — blood libel with respect to the way they depicted Erwin with the bloody knife and fork — and a sense that we’re holding all Jews accountable for anything that we find problematic with respect to the situation [in Gaza] unless and until they actively renounce and reject Israel. That’s really problematic. It really goes against all of the standards of community that we have. </p><p>If it was any other group, we wouldn’t do it. We’re not seeing on college campuses, attacks and questioning every student of Russian heritage because we take issue with the Putin administration, and what they’ve done in Ukraine and other places around the world. We’re not seeing where we’re attacking every Muslim student, because we take issue with what Hamas did on Oct. 7. One can debate the space between anti-Zionism and antisemitism. But one would have to have serious blinders not to recognize that what’s happening on college campuses, UCs included, is a series of activities that are targeting Jewish students because of their identities, making them feel unsafe and apart from the rest of the community in a way that really should have no place in our society and no place on our college campuses.</p><p><b>But we have seen spikes in incidences of Islamophobia and anti-Arab sentiment, too</b><i>.</i></p><p>Absolutely.</p><p><b>Are you saying that the antisemitism we’re seeing is disproportionate?&#xa0;</b></p><p>The antisemitism is absolutely disproportionate. We reject both. We reject all forms of hatred. But what we’re not seeing is massive student protests targeting every Muslim-identified student, asking students of Muslim or Arabic background to denounce or renounce something that they have no part in. The numbers and the spikes are vastly different, and the types of incidences are vastly different. </p><p>I was on the Los Angeles City Human Relations Commission, I think I was president at the time in 2001 when 9/11 happened. We immediately came together and said, ’how do we avoid an irrational targeting of Muslim members of our community in the wake of the response to 9/11?' Now that said, we saw spikes in anti-Muslim activities, Islamophobic activities. That was problematic and offensive. And we've seen some of that now, and we have to speak out against that.</p><p>It’s interesting to me that the only time where we have to do this both sides-y rejection is when the victims are Jewish. When we saw a spike in anti-Asian hate crimes over the last couple of years, there was no immediate pushback that said, now you have to reject these other forms [of hate]. In fact, after George Floyd, when we were talking about Black Lives Matter, there was a clear distinction that if you responded by saying, “All Lives Matter,” that yes, that’s true that all lives matter, but if you were doing it reflexively you are denying the real pattern and problem of what was happening in the African American community. So we’ve got to be careful in that we should be able to have a conversation about the spike in antisemitism, the very clear expression of antisemitism, without then having to do a litany of [denouncing other forms of hate in order] to renounce the antisemitism.</p><p><b>There are a number of California campuses, including three UC campuses — Berkeley, UCLA and San Diego — that at the moment are under investigation by the federal Department of Education in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks because of discriminatory incidents. What can you tell us about where those investigations stand?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I can’t tell you anything about where those investigations stand. I’m not fully read in on the moment to moment of the investigations. And to the extent that I know anything in the middle of an investigation, it would be inappropriate for me to comment.</p><p>But at a certain level, there’s got to be a gut check. When you look at something, does it look right? And then can you go and figure out a way to confirm that your inclinations are correct, and that you can create defensible policies based on that? It was right that you asked about the 1960s in the Free Speech movement, and the antiwar movement. We’re 60 years later. We should have learned from 60 years. How do we adjust in real time? On many college campuses, there’s been such an orthodoxy around the First Amendment that there hasn’t been enough debate about how it exists in conflict with these other protections. </p><p>Let me give you an example of where I think students broadly would say the First Amendment should have limits — sexual harassment. We know that we can regulate certain speech that is, in fact, sexual harassment. At what point does the First Amendment come into conflict and into tension with other sets of laws and other protections? Again, I’m not a lawyer. I’m not a constitutional scholar. But there’s some basic common sense questions that are asked.</p><p><b>Another question around these free speech issues is directly on your plate as a regent.

And this last one, I don’t know if I made the ultimate motion to put it off or not, but I think I did, again, because there’s more work.</p><p>Any regulation has to be content neutral. What I did say at the last meeting is the timing of it makes the action suspect. Had we done this a few years before, without the current tension, it would be less suspect than it is right now. Now, college campuses have free speech zones. Public buildings have places where free speech is and is not allowed. I think it’s reasonable to say that as we move to a world that significantly exists and people interact with online, you can make distinctions between places where you have official business versus opinion. It’s appropriate. Newspapers have editorial and opinion pages and letters to the editor. Websites don’t do as good a job, in my opinion, of moderating comments, but there’s a distinction between editorial space, news space, opinion space. I think it’s reasonable to try to find that distinction if it’s 1) content neutral, and 2) provides an equally accessible way to access people’s opinions.</p><p><b>I’d like for you to put on your jersey as a lifelong Democrat for a moment. You know that a crucial part of your party’s coalition depends on young people. When you see the intensity of the reaction to the Israel-Hamas war on campus and the criticism that Biden is getting for how he’s been handling this, does that make you worried for November?&#xa0;</b></p><p>You’ve seen the Biden administration’s view and interaction with Israel evolve in real time based on real circumstances. Biden, who has a lifetime record of having a very positive relationship with Israel, has also been trying to hold the Netanyahu administration accountable and pushing back. Is that enough to satisfy the critics? Of course not. It’s appropriate to have tension. But in the end, elections are about choices. This is going to be a question about Biden versus Trump. Students, like everybody else, need to look at the totality of everything that they’re offering as candidates and I think that young people will once again overwhelmingly vote for Biden.</p><p><b>That sounds to me like you’re not very worried.</b></p><p>No, no. I’m worried. But I’m also hopeful. This doesn’t happen magically. It happens by having conversations, by engaging voters, by talking to voters, by looking at what’s at issue. It’s not enough to say, “Hey, young people are going to be so offended by what Trump is doing on abortion..." You have to speak to the concerns that they’ve articulated. <br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350278288112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><b>You’re Mexican American and grew up with deep ties to the Jewish community in east L.A.

Does it concern you that these two communities that you have been so much a part of seem to have a fraying relationship?</b></p><p>It worries me that Americans writ large are becoming more isolationist. There’s not only an interest in us playing less of a role in the conflict in the Middle East, but there’s a spike in folks wanting us to play less of a role in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. But yes, it bothers me that there’s less of a connection between communities that have historically been connected. But Latinos exist in the same world that everybody else does. Latinos are a disproportionately young community — younger on average than just about any other ethnic group. And young people have grown up with 20 years of the Netanyahu administration that they increasingly take issue with. </p><p>Latinos also are horrified by what happened on Oct. 7. Absolutely horrified — by murder, by rape, by torture, by kidnapping. Part of the problem with a poll is what question you’re asking. What does cease-fire mean? Does cease-fire mean a temporary cease-fire, does it mean an effort at sustainable peace? I’m somebody who’s supportive of cease-fire. It can’t be unilateral. It doesn’t work that way.</p><p><b>Putting the polls aside, do you sense a fraying in the relationship between Jews and Latinos?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I think there’s a little fraying in the relationship but what I think we’re seeing is a national spike in antisemitism and it expresses itself in every community. Latinos don’t exist in a bubble. And there has been a persistent rise in antisemitism. And it goes unchecked in ways that discriminatory actions against other communities do not go unchecked.</p><p>When somebody on a college campus targets a Muslim student for identity, targets a Muslim woman for wearing traditional garb, there is offense taken and a pushback. The same isn’t expressing itself when we’re seeing antisemitic acts. At the last Regents meeting, protesters erected an effigy, in violation of policy, of a bloody pig holding a cage, bags of money and [it] said “UC regents time is running out.” Protesters came and took over the Regents meeting and the room was cleared. I think three of us stayed in the room to listen. Nobody took the opportunity to speak to the three of us. It was just chants. And the chants weren’t about a policy, the chants were about Jews. They were about Jews. It wasn’t about this university policy or that university policy, it wasn’t even that the regents need to divest. It was about Jews. It was antisemitic.</p><p><b>What were the chants?&#xa0;</b></p><p>“We've got to go after these Jews.” “We got to stop the Jewish lobby.” It was very clear.</p><p>We have gotten to a point of both sides-ism in this question, which is completely not constructive. When I go around to different college campuses, I tend to meet with a cross section of students and faculty. I have only in my 14 years on the board been challenged once about trying to meet with a group of students. And it was trying to meet with a group of Jewish students on a campus where there have been efforts to target their Hillel. The campus told me that if you meet with Jewish students, you have to meet with the Muslim students. I said, “I’m meeting with students at Hillel because Hillel was targeted.” There’s no balancing that needs to happen. If you asked me to meet with Muslim students because I’m on campus, I’m happy to do it. But it can’t be because I’m meeting with Jewish students. When I go meet with Latino students, I don’t have to go balance that by meeting with somebody else. When I go meet with LGBTQ students, I don’t have to balance that with meeting somebody else. When I go meet veteran students that are dealing with the complexity of coming back after having served and navigating a college campus, I’m not told you now have to go meet with another group. The only time it’s ever happened was in one instance trying to meet the Jewish students. It shouldn’t be the case.</p><p><b>Anything else you’d like to add?</b></p><p>I take all of this personally. I take it a little more personally at a UC because I have responsibility for UC. I take it a little more personally still at Berkeley because it’s such an important part of my life experience. Berkeley is the first place where I ever experienced a Ramadan. Berkeley was the first place I ever meaningfully engaged with the Muslim student community and navigated making sure that we were an inclusive campus for Muslim students. As you mentioned, I have a clear, very personal tie to the Jewish community. But that’s not an exclusion of a tie and an interest in the Muslim community. Having a deep connection to one community doesn’t mean that there’s not a concern and care for another.<br /></p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

References to America’s past litter his public remarks, and the portraits of historical figures like Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan that hung in his office on Capitol Hill were frequently mentioned in his stump speeches. A riff where he discussed the reproduction of <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11417" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>Washington Crossing the Delaware&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11417&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7a70002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7a70003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>Washington Crossing the Delaware</u></a> in his conference room was so often repeated that it became a punchline in McCarthy world. Joe Biden has his Scranton roots, Donald Trump has his border wall and Kevin McCarthy has Emanuel Leutze.</p><p>Six months after his <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2023/10/03/congress/mccarthy-out-speaker-conservatives-oust-boot-00119732" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>ouster as speaker of the House&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2023/10/03/congress/mccarthy-out-speaker-conservatives-oust-boot-00119732&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7a70004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7a70005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>ouster as speaker of the House</u></a>, McCarthy is trying to write his <i>own</i> history. Although still comparatively young at 59 in an era of octogenarian politicians, it’s hard to imagine a world in which the first line of his obituary is not that he was the first speaker ever removed from office. So now, McCarthy seems to have set himself to the task of shaping how future generations remember that moment and the eight months he spent wielding the gavel — even if it requires a selective retelling of what happened with a few big omissions.</p><p>This past Tuesday, McCarthy brought his effort to shape his legacy to a windowless auditorium on the campus of Georgetown University for an event called “How Strong Is Our Democracy? With Kevin McCarthy.” If the name of the event is any indication, he wants to be remembered as someone who buttressed American democracy during his time in public service.</p><p>In the late-arriving crowd of around 100 students, one could see the full range of those who would stay inside on the first warm spring night of the year to listen to a retired politician. There were those clad in suits who sat close to the stage to listen while others were busy multitasking, working on assignments or playing word games with their laptops open.</p><p>After the customary introduction, McCarthy, along with former Democratic operative and current Georgetown professor Mo Elleithee, who served as the interlocutor, sat down on the stage and began the program with polite jokes before asking the former House speaker why trust in democracy was so low in the United States.</p><p>Even at an event about the strength of American democracy, there was little urgency in how McCarthy spoke. At a time when both Democrats and Republicans — for very different reasons — warn that “democracy is on the ballot” in 2024, he didn’t seem to have that level of concern about the stakes. Instead, McCarthy offered a broader critique of modern American politics that mixed platitudes about media and the fragmented state of the two main parties with a healthy dose of whataboutism offered in a friendly, self-deprecating manner. He mourned the siloing of how Americans consume media. “You can go home, and you get your news from an outlet that philosophically agrees with you” that offers opinion rather than reporting, he said. “You have social media that's providing something very quickly. There's no editor in charge of what somebody says.”</p><p>And when he had to specifically apportion the blame, McCarthy tried to strike a pose as detached from partisanship as possible for someone who spent the past half decade <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/2022-midterms-kevin-mccarthy-is-the-man-in-the-maga-middle.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>leading a political party in Congress&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/2022-midterms-kevin-mccarthy-is-the-man-in-the-maga-middle.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7a70006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7a70007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>leading a political party in Congress</u></a>. For him, the failed lawsuit to throw Trump off the ballot in Colorado and the suppression on social media of the story of Hunter Biden’s laptop were threats just as real as January 6 — an event he took pains to condemn. “What happened on January 6 was wrong; I don’t apologize for anyone who did it,” he said. But it was a critique of those who stormed the Capitol, not those, including Trump, who spent months egging on MAGA loyalists to do so. He bemoaned the increase in partisan politics in Washington. It could have been out of the No Labels handbook, save for the fact that he only blamed Democrats and of course the member of Congress he holds most responsible for his ouster, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).</p><p>He conflated Democratic election denialism and Republican election denialism as he waxed on about what he described as Democratic efforts to overturn past presidential elections, ranging from the hanging chads of 2000 to comments Hillary Clinton made about the 2016 election, before finally addressing his vote against the certification of the 2020 presidential election in Arizona and Pennsylvania.</p><p>McCarthy argued that his vote was simply about expressing some concern over procedural changes during the Covid pandemic rather than any desire to change the result of the 2020 presidential election. It was part of the normal cut and thrust of politics. In contrast, he argued, the Democrats were the ones who tried to overturn elections.</p><p>“The one point I would raise to you is, those who questioned the race when George Bush won challenged Ohio. Had they been successful, Bush would not be president,” said McCarthy, referencing an effort after the 2004 election by a handful of congressional Democrats without the backing of John Kerry to protest voter irregularities, including long waits, for many voters in the state. In contrast, McCarthy argued, “had Republicans who challenged the 2020 race been successful in their two challenges, Joe Biden would still be president. He just wouldn’t have the same electoral votes. A challenge doesn’t mean you’re overturning something. A challenge is a challenge.”</p><p>That wasn’t quite the whole story. Trump allies had initially planned significantly more challenges than just to the electoral votes of Arizona and Pennsylvania, including Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin. This <i>would</i> have been sufficient to overturn the election. However, the number of challenges was pared back after the debate on the first challenge was delayed for 10 hours due to the violent invasion of the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.</p><p>McCarthy also offered his defense of the infamous picture of him with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in the weeks after Trump left office. The visit was viewed as a dramatic boost to the former president’s political fortunes in the immediate aftermath of his second impeachment trial. For McCarthy, this was just supposed to be a quiet visit to a friend going through a tough time.</p><p>As McCarthy described his philosophy of friendship: “Whether I like you or dislike you, if something bad happens in your life, I want to be the first person to call you. … The first thing that happens when something bad happens, [is that] everyone abandons you. I want to call you. … I just want to know how you’re doing as a person.”</p><p>In the former speaker’s telling, he just happened to be in Palm Beach for a fundraiser when he got a call asking him to visit Trump. McCarthy turned down dinner but said he could “come by for lunch.” But then, 30 minutes later, the<i> New York Times </i>knew about the visit, which was supposed to be private. As McCarthy said, “I didn’t tell my staff.”</p><p>(In former Rep. Liz Cheney’s 2023 book, <i>Oath and Hono</i>r<i>, </i>she said McCarthy told her that he went because Trump “wasn’t eating”: “They’re really worried,” McCarthy said. “Trump’s not eating, so they asked me to come see him.”)</p><p>McCarthy then recounted a conversation where Trump quizzes him immediately after sitting down together for lunch. Trump asks the following questions to McCarthy:</p><p>“Did you leak it?”</p><p>“Did your staff leak it?”</p><p>“Do you think my staff leaked it?”</p><p>Each time, McCarthy answered in the negative.</p><p>Finally, the former president asked him ‘Who do you think leaked it?’”</p><p>McCarthy replies “You” to laughter in the room of Georgetown students. Then, in the former speaker’s telling “[Trump] looks at me, and he goes, ‘Well, it’s good for both of us, you know.’” As he was telling the story, McCarthy shrugged, eliciting even louder laughter from the crowd.</p><p>The faux-intimate revelation of these private conversations added to McCarthy’s appeal to the crowd. What went unremarked was how simply resigned McCarthy apparently was to the fact that Trump leaked the story and the sense that dealing with the former president was more akin to managing a tantrum-prone child and a political ally — after all, McCarthy once infamously presented the then-president with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kevin-mccarthy-relishes-role-as-trumps-fixer-friend-and-candy-man/2018/01/15/a2696b4e-f709-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>handpicked Starburst candies&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kevin-mccarthy-relishes-role-as-trumps-fixer-friend-and-candy-man/2018/01/15/a2696b4e-f709-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7a70008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7a70009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>handpicked Starburst candies</u></a> to ensure that he only received his favorite flavors.</p><p>Yet for all the emotional support that McCarthy may have provided after Trump left office, the former president also left McCarthy dangling when he was ousted as speaker. This, too, went unmentioned.</p><p>He was diplomatic when asked about more controversial parts of Trump’s record. “I didn’t know that he had a fake electors scheme,” McCarthy said when asked about the former president’s actions in the immediate aftermath of the 2020 election. When asked about Trump’s references to immigrants poisoning the blood of our country, McCarthy said “I’ve never heard him say that.” He added eventually, “I don’t think that’s what President Trump believes in my time around him. Never heard it.” Trump has repeatedly used the phrase in recent months, including in a March interview on Fox News.</p><p>And as for his ouster in 2023? At one point, he asked, “Want another inside story?” to the crowd, after which he reiterated a familiar complaint that Democrats had betrayed him by supporting the effort. He also blamed the vote as driven by the bad-faith efforts of Gaetz. Gaetz, <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/04/09/congress/mccarthy-on-gaetz-00151412" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>he said, had a vendetta because McCarthy&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/04/09/congress/mccarthy-on-gaetz-00151412&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7a7000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7a7000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>he said, had a vendetta because McCarthy</u></a> did not “stop an ethics complaint because [Gaetz] slept with a 17-year-old.” (The Justice Department dropped its investigation into Gaetz for sex trafficking in 2023, and the Florida Republican has denied having a relationship with a minor.)</p><p>It was all part of a tale that put the best spin possible on his political career.</p><p>At least at Georgetown, McCarthy’s act worked among a crowd where many experienced Trump’s first election before they experienced puberty. The ambitious students all were hesitant to use their names with the typical caution of online undergrads. One junior from Connecticut leaving the event clutching a bag of Sour Patch Kids found McCarthy, “actually really funny, very personable guy.” A Democrat, she said “she didn’t have a lot of expectations” from the event and was just curious to hear the “other side of the aisle’s thoughts going on in Congress and his personal experience.”</p><p>Another sophomore from California, leaving the event in a Zach Bryan t-shirt, also left with a more favorable opinion of McCarthy. He described himself politically as “center-left leaning” and said that while he didn’t agree with McCarthy’s politics, he thought that what the former speaker said about “different people having different experiences and you have to understand that was important.”</p><p>A single event at a college campus won’t determine what goes in the history books. McCarthy held an event the following night at Harvard Kennedy School — this one was called “The 2024 Election, Trump, and the Future of American Democracy” — which went very similarly to the Georgetown event; at times, McCarthy repeated himself word for word. Eventually, they add up. History is a slippery thing, and the way in which figures are enshrined in historical memory constantly changes. Heroes often turn to villains, and sometimes, villains even turn into heroes.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine what values Americans will hold in the 22nd century or if they will even know Kevin McCarthy’s name.</p><p>A House Republican colleague sniped to me last year that all McCarthy cared about was whether he’d become speaker and have his portrait hung in the speaker’s lobby alongside all of his predecessors. But it’s clear he cares about more than that. It’s not just that the portrait is there but that someday, someone will think it will be worth hanging in their office, too.<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

But on Monday in New York, the “hush money” case is set to begin. And Cohen is the star witness — the man who paid Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump. Trump then reimbursed Cohen and, as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleges in his 34-count indictment, falsified records about those payments to “conceal criminal activity.”</p><p>Trump’s defense is simple: You can’t trust Cohen.</p><p>So what does Cohen have to say on the eve of the first criminal trial of a former president, someone who happens to be his one-time boss and mentor?</p><p>A lot.</p><p>I talked to Cohen on Thursday for this week’s episode of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839?i=1000652234879" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1712928099248,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000152-8eed-d275-addf-bfff4c8f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1712928099248,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000152-8eed-d275-addf-bfff4c8f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839?i=1000652234879&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-d278-dd93-a19f-fffa76360000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Playbook Deep Dive podcast&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-d278-dd93-a19f-fffa76350000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Playbook Deep Dive podcast</a> just after he had learned that Trump had attacked him on Truth Social, possibly violating a gag order that Cohen says must finally be enforced.</p><p>Together, we discussed how he will defend the assault on his credibility at the trial, why Bragg’s case is stronger than analysts believe, the legal tactics he’s expecting from Trump’s team, whether he ever regrets breaking with Trump and what Daniels’ tarot cards predicted about the outcome of the case.</p><p><i>This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.</i><br /></p><br /><p><b>I've heard you say that people are wrong when they say that this is the weakest of the four cases against Trump. Tell me if I've got that right?</b></p><p>What I've said consistently is that for whatever the reason might be, the American public treats these four indictments like it's the Kentucky Derby. Everybody's handicapping and picking and choosing which one is the most offensive and violative of law.</p><p>I will concede right now that the January 6th insurrection is more grotesque in terms of illegal behavior than this specific case — campaign finance, hush money, we'll call it business record fraud. That's what I prefer to call it: the "business record fraud" case.</p><p>Then you have the failure to return top-secret documents, showing them to people who do not have proper clearance to see [and] that places America's national security in jeopardy. Yes, that is more abusive towards the law than the campaign finance-business record fraud case. And I will even turn around and say that the Fani Willis case — attempting to overturn a free and fair election [in Georgia] — is more of a grotesque abuse of the law than the Alvin Bragg case. Nevertheless, the campaign finance — the business record fraud — is a crime, and if it was you or anybody else, they would already have been indicted, the case would have already proceeded and chances are they would have already been convicted and sentenced.</p><p><b>Trump's defense is going to be to paint you as an untrustworthy witness. He's going to cite your guilty plea for lying to Congress, and the fact that the Justice Department declined to offer you a cooperation deal because prosecutors thought you lied to them. And he'll say you're out for revenge and that you have a financial incentive to see him convicted. So how do you defend yourself from those accusations?</b></p><p>I wish that when people state that “you lied to Congress,” that you’d do me the courtesy — do <i>yourself</i> the courtesy — of finishing the sentence. What is the sentence? That I had done that, really, for the benefit of Donald J. Trump. And that lie centered around the number of times that I had stated that I spoke to Donald about the failed Trump Tower Moscow real estate project — in conjunction with other lawyers Jay Sekulow, Abbe Lowell, Ty Cobb, with other individuals like Alan Garten or Ivanka [Trump] and Jared [Kushner]. Everybody worked on that statement. I was just the fool who went ahead and read it into the record and submitted it. But what benefit did I have in terms of saying three times versus 10? That's the lie: That I claimed to have spoken to Donald <i>three</i> times about the failed Trump Tower Moscow real estate project, when the true answer was 10.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350787543112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><b>I appreciate you putting it in context. With these other accusations, is that the way you approach it: You put those things in context for the jury so that they understand them,&#xa0; and what sounds like a dramatic allegation can be defanged?</b></p><p>Absolutely. There is a ton of misinformation, disinformation, malinformation that has been put out there by Trump and acolytes literally since the Steele dossier. We all know that the Steele dossier was completely inaccurate, as it related to me. I don't even talk about any of the other allegations raised in that garbage document.</p><p><b>I remember when we were all asking you if you went to …</b></p><p>I've never been to the Czech Republic. I've never been to Prague. As soon as I had gotten out of Otisville [Correctional Facility], I was contemplating on going there and taking photos and tweeting out: "Glad to be back in Prague."</p><p><b>Credibility is one part of this trial. </b><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/11/trump-alvin-bragg-trial-win-00151558" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;b>The other c-word that comes up is \&quot;corroboration.\&quot;&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/11/trump-alvin-bragg-trial-win-00151558&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7ac0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7ac0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>The other c-word that comes up is "corroboration."</b></a><b> And that's something that you and Lanny Davis, your adviser and attorney, talk about a lot: that there will be corroboration. What can you tell us about that? Is this a stronger case when it comes to corroboration than people understand on the outside?</b></p><p>If it wasn't, Alvin Bragg and his team of prosecutors would never have brought this case.</p><p><b>Do you think we'll be surprised by it — by some of the corroborating evidence?</b></p><p>I do.</p><p><b>Okay. In other words: We don't know everything that's going to be presented?</b></p><p>In fact, most people don't really know anything. They only know what the headlines have been. And as you know very, very well, headlines do not necessarily tell the story.</p><p><b>One of the big obstacles seems to be how Bragg connects the misdemeanor of falsifying business records that recorded what were actually hush money payments — the payments to you to reimburse you for the payments to Stormy Daniels — to another crime that Trump was trying to commit, which then makes this a felony. That’s sort of the gist of the case. Do you think Bragg has strong evidence on that portion of the case?</b></p><p>Let me say it to you this way — it may not be satisfying to you, and I do certainly appreciate the attempts to drill down despite me telling you I cannot go into into this case: Alvin Bragg would not have brought this case — he would not have that as an element of this case — if he did not believe that he would be able to prove this at trial to a jury of 12.</p><p><b>Michael, your case may end up being the only case that goes to trial this year — meaning that you are<i> the</i> key witness that will determine whether Donald Trump goes to jail before the 2024 election. What is it like having that sort of weight on your shoulders?</b></p><p>It's a heavy weight. It's a weight that is difficult, on a daily basis, to carry around. I wish I wasn’t involved in this at all. Not that I don't want to see accountability; it is incredibly taxing on your heart, on your mind and on your soul. I can tell you from a physical and a health standpoint, since this all started coming down, I'm down 22 pounds.</p><p><b>You look great, by the way.</b></p><p>I look horrible. I'm at the same weight now that I was at when I was released from the 51 days of solitary confinement as a result of an unconstitutional remand against me, weaponized by [then-Attorney General] Bill Barr and Trump to go against his critics. So it's just a side note to those people who don't believe what Donald says, whether it's during these rallies or these ridiculous statements that he makes. Trust me: I've been there. I know what he's intending to do, and he's not bluffing.</p><p><b>Let me just be clear about this, because I think there's some people who think that solitary confinement is a form of torture and should be banned: When you say “solitary confinement,” describe what you mean and what that was like.</b></p><p>I was put into a cell that is approximately eight feet by 10 feet, and it is a toilet, a sink, a locker, a bed and a chair with a desk that's attached to the wall. And you sit there for 24 hours, seven days a week. It's not like you see in “Shawshank Redemption” or any of those movies where you’re out in the yard and able to shoot hoops for an hour. Every now and then, they let you go grab your meal, but then you come right back. The only time you were out was Monday, Wednesday and Friday for 15 minutes to take a shower, or twice a week for a five-minute phone call to your family. My cell was by far the worst of all. The window was broken. It was missing a piece of plate glass. When it would rain, it would rain in on me. During the day, it’s about 100-plus degrees, 105 degrees in that cell, with no ventilation. The flies would come in. The sink was broken. The toilets were broken. The facility in and of itself was filthy. That’s what solitary confinement was for me.</p><p><b>Based on what you know about Trump, what do you think a second Trump term would be like?</b></p><p>In 2018, when I testified before the House Oversight Committee, I predicted before anybody that my biggest fear was that if Donald loses the 2020 election, that there will never be a peaceful transfer of power. Those were my words in 2018. And sadly, it became a reality.</p><p>I’m going to give you my next prediction: If, God forbid a million times, Donald wins the election in 2024, there will never be another election again in America. Because Donald believes, like Putin, that it doesn’t matter who you vote for; all that matters is who’s counting the vote. So there might be this <i>impression</i> of an election, but it will never be a legitimate election ever again. He has no intention of being another one-term president. This, for him, is presidency for life.</p><p><b>On the flip side of that, if this prosecution is successful and ends with jail time, what do you think that would do to the country? And do you think that’s a real possibility — that Donald Trump could end up in jail based on this case?</b></p><p>That's up to the 12 jurors and of course, to the way that both prosecutors handle the case and defense is able to represent Trump on his position. I can’t tell you what will happen or what won’t happen. I’m not the great Carnac; I don’t have the crystal ball.</p><p>I don't believe that Trump is going to win this election. I believe that as a result of his taking credit for the overturning of<i> Roe v. Wade</i>, he has angered a group of America — specifically women in America and those men that support women for women’s reproductive rights — and I think that that’s just one of the very stupid things that Trump, the GOP, MAGA, has done.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/1f/0a/e8c8b1d349fd8c696f612836396a/trump-fraud-lawsuit-72449.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Do you think Trump wants to testify?</b></p><p>I think he’d like you to believe that he would.</p><p>It would be worse than the deposition he gave at the E. Jean Carroll trial case, where he couldn't even recognize that E. Jean Carroll was not his ex-wife, Marla Maples. Donald does not know how to tell the truth. He's lied so many times that he cannot keep track of the lies. And one lie begets another lie. He would be putting himself into a perjury trap by taking the stand.</p><p>He'd be a horrible witness. You guys would all enjoy it because it would give you so much to talk about. "Saturday Night Live" would pay Donald to get up on the witness stand; they wouldn't have to write anything for then maybe the next three, four episodes.</p><p><b>Give us a sense, on the eve of this trial that starts on Monday, just mentally where you are and how you're preparing for this.</b></p><p>Well, my preparation is really just looking over some of the old testimony that I had given. Remember: It goes back to 2018. So it's really just more of a review. My story has not changed. It's just very repetitive.</p><p>I'm not the defendant in this case. The defendant in this case is the former president, Donald J. Trump. So what does he do? He starts to attack. And despite the gag orders that have been put on by the judges, he nevertheless continues to do what he wants. He will say whatever he wants. He violates the gag order. And like a petulant child, there appears to be no repercussion. He legitimately just posted something calling me a sleazebag. And of course, he attacked Stormy Daniels as well. It's called witness intimidation and obstruction of justice.</p><p><b>Will you be asking the court for sanctions and for the judge to enforce his gag order, which does allow for sanctions?</b></p><p>I don't have the right to make that call. That call has to be made by the prosecutors.</p><p>I don't want to testify. I have been extremely clear about it. I have already testified before the Mueller team. I've testified before seven congressional committees. I've testified to the New York attorney general. I've been part of grand jury indictments. You know, now I'm supposed to again testify before the Manhattan D.A. case. I'm not asking to be a witness, let alone be referred to as a “key” witness. I am a non-party subpoenaed witness. My intention is to comply with this subpoena, though I would prefer not to.</p><p><b>Fair. Do you want Bragg to ask Judge Merchan to enforce it, after Trump attacked you?</b></p><p>Well, I think they should — specifically so as to ensure that the case, once it starts on Monday, operates in a respectful manner and one that does not place witnesses — myself included — in harm's way.</p><p><b>You're ready to testify Monday morning, but you just don't know yet when they're going to call you?</b></p><p>There's no chance in the world that I'm testifying on Monday. The process starts with what's called voir dire. That's where they're going to impanel the 12 jurors with the two alternates.</p><p>They are going to pull out every stop they can to try to demonstrate to the judge that they can not get a fair jury — that they can not get a fair trial here in New York. And that way, somewhere down the road, they're going to once again make another motion claiming that they need for Judge Merchan to be recused, that they need the venue to be changed because Donald is afforded, under the Constitution, the right to a fair trial. That's their next move. It will not work.</p><p>Let's say 30 days is what it will ultimately be before the jury gets impaneled. I'm not even expected to be one of the first witnesses. I'll probably be more like in baseball: clean-up. I'll be like a fourth or fifth batter. They're going to keep me on that stand for as long as they possibly can, trying to discredit me. So that way, they can use that to try to make a case during appeal, why this case should not stand, and have it overturned.</p><p><b>You and Stormy Daniels have struck up an unlikely friendship after all you went through. And I know that she's done tarot card readings for you. Did she do a tarot card reading about this case?&#xa0;</b></p><p>She did do a tarot card reading for me when she was on my "Mea Culpa" podcast. I don't specifically remember all of the things that she said, but she turned around and she said that the cards show that Donald will be held accountable.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6349671517112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><b>The jury questionnaire had a question that asks the jurors, “Have you ever listened to any podcasts by or read any books by Michael Cohen?” Suggesting that this is going to be a little bit of an issue. Do you ever regret your sort of media empire that you’ve built? Do you think it has complicated this case?</b></p><p>Well, I appreciate you calling it an empire. Am I upset about the fact that I have done as much media as I have? Absolutely not. Because if it's not me who's speaking and trying to inform the country — not just Democrats, but Republicans and most importantly, the independents, the undecideds — if it's not me, who is it going to be?</p><p>The easiest thing for me to have done early on, when all of this mishegoss was going down in my life, would have been to keep my mouth shut. I probably would have been the first person that Donald pardoned. And I'd probably be working for Fox News, Newsmax. I'd be the head of the RNC, probably, with Lara Trump, or something stupid like that. But I would be putting America's democracy — I'd be putting my children's future and your children's future — in jeopardy. And I wasn't going to do that.</p><p>I can't tell you the number of fellow inmates that would say to me all the time: "Why didn't you just keep your fucking mouth shut? Keep your mouth shut, you'd be the first one pardoned. You would be working right now making millions of dollars with the Republican Party. Instead, you keep fighting him."</p><p><b>In the back of your mind, do you ever think this really wasn't worth it?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I think about everything. I think about the day that Donald asked me to come to work for him. I didn't need to work for him. I was semi-retired. I was 39. I was set; I got lucky early on. I was finally getting a chance to enjoy time with my wife, my children. Unfortunately, I’d just come off of a terrible health issue that almost took my life. And so being sort of sedate, I was looking for something that would have given me some activity that would spark my entrepreneurial spirit again. I like to be busy. And Donald, when he made that offer to me, fit that exact set of parameters.</p><p>That was 2007. He made me one of the three members of the board of Miss Universe. It was Donald, Allen Weisselberg and me — that's not the greatest of company. I was co-president of Trump Productions; he had the number-one TV show at the time. I was working on real estate projects, including one … where we would have built an entire city, literally right before entering New York through the tunnel, with 10,000 apartments. I was given this great responsibility: I was <i>personal attorney</i> to Donald J. Trump. And he was not the Donald Trump that you see today. Donald today is the worst version of himself imaginable.</p><p><b>Explain that transition. What do you think has made him more of a caricature of himself in terms of the way that you're describing him?</b></p><p>Power. The old adage "absolute power corrupts absolutely"? That should be written on his epitaph one day.</p><p><b>You've talked about and written that it was Jared Kushner and Don Jr. that convinced Trump to throw you under the bus. What would have happened if he hadn't listened?</b></p><p>Chances are he may not be in the position that he's in right now because I may not have come clean. I may not have provided the information. I may not have been able to emotionally break away from the cult and acknowledge — despite the ongoing continuous harassment of my wife, my daughter and my son — that I need to snap out of this, that your loyalty belongs to us and the country.</p><p><b>Who do you think Donald Trump will pick as his VP?</b></p><p>Guaranteed it'll be a woman, because he is right now so deep down into the dumpster when it comes to women that he needs to show that he's not the sexist misogynist that he is. And I think if he could find a woman of color, that would be better. But he won't do it. I see somebody like a Nancy Mace or maybe even [Sen. Katie] Britt, because of their looks.</p><p><b>That's important to Donald Trump?</b></p><p>Very, very. He believes in optics. It's almost like why he would walk and he'd have Hope Hicks right by his side, shoulder to shoulder. He believes that everyone is sort of as mentally corrupt as he is, and he's visual. So like with "The Apprentice," him coming off the helicopter with 30 beautiful women following behind him? He thinks it makes him look bigger and more important.</p><p>So I do believe it will be a woman. I believe that, in his mind, he will consider her to be attractive. He also needs somebody who will not outshine him. That's why somebody like a Nikki Haley could never be the choice. She's too strong a person and she would suck up some of his oxygen in the room. And for Donald, owning all the oxygen in the room is what he constantly needs. It's what keeps him going.</p><p><i>Listen to this episode of Playbook Deep Dive on </i><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;i>Apple Podcasts&lt;/i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7ac0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7ac0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>Apple Podcasts</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0YmkWN5cyxuqBh5Vl78yGp" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;i>Spotify &lt;/i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/0YmkWN5cyxuqBh5Vl78yGp&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7ac0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7ac0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>Spotify </i></a><i>or wherever you get your podcasts.</i><br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

But it’s far from the only example. Over the past year, in ways large and small, in criminal cases and civil ones, Trump has consistently been given more freedom and more privileges than virtually any other defendant in his shoes.<br /></p><br /><p>Some judges in Trump’s cases may have afforded him unique leeway in hopes of avoiding any appearance that they are meddling in the 2024 campaign. Indeed, Trump’s role as a presidential candidate — one who is always eager to play the martyr — complicates the task of prosecutors and judges eager to lower the temperature of the proceedings. Penalizing Trump before he’s ever convicted of anything could stir a backlash and trigger more heat, not less.</p><p>Trump supporters surely bristle at the notion that he’s getting any preferential treatment. After all, he is facing dozens of felony counts across <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2023/trump-criminal-investigations-cases-tracker-list/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;four criminal cases&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/interactives/2023/trump-criminal-investigations-cases-tracker-list/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7b4000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7b4000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">four criminal cases</a>, and a series of massive civil judgments has damaged his reputation and his wealth.</p><p>But the fact is that no other person in America — if charged with the diverse panoply of malfeasance that Trump has been accused of — would enjoy the same procedural and structural advantages that Trump has harnessed, to great effect, as his legal troubles reached a fever pitch over the past 12 months.</p><p>There may be good reasons for some of those advantages. A former president and current candidate is no ordinary criminal defendant. But special treatment carries a hefty price: It shatters the American lore that everyone is treated equally before the law.</p><p>The result, ironically, is a partial confirmation of one of Trump’s favorite grievances. He’s enmeshed in a “two-tiered system of justice,” he often says — and he’s right. There are two tiers. But Trump frequently has been the beneficiary, not the victim.</p><p>Here’s how.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/b3/6d/37f852974c14ba55f743eec1ceb7/trump-indictment-37471.jpg" /><br /><h2 style="text-align: center">Avoiding the courthouse chaos</h2><p>It started with the first arraignment.</p><p>Just over a year ago, Trump became the only former president in history to be indicted.

But the authorities made special accommodations that largely spared Trump from the byzantine, often humiliating procedures that thousands of other defendants endure every day. He was not handcuffed. No mug shot was taken. Rather than sitting in a holding cell for hours while waiting for a judge, Trump was whisked through the courthouse and then released on his own recognizance.</p><p>Over the next six months, Trump was indicted in three more cases: two (in Washington, D.C., and Georgia) for trying to overturn the 2020 election, and one (in Florida) for storing classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after his presidency and obstructing the government’s efforts to get them back. The arraignments in those cases largely followed the same choreography. (The Georgia authorities, unlike their counterparts in the other jurisdictions, did take Trump’s mug shot — which he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/26/trump-mugshot-fundraising-00113118" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;promptly used as a fundraising tool&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/26/trump-mugshot-fundraising-00113118&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7b50002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7b50003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">promptly used as a fundraising tool</a>.)</p><p>No one argues, of course, that the arraignment of a former president should play out like a typical surrender of a suspect wanted by police.

And then there’s New Jersey. </p><p>In the Garden State, Katyal — the Beltway-famous legal combatant against Trump-era assaults on democratic norms — has thrown himself into a very different legal battle: He’s working to restore a voting rule that enables machine-politics bosses to stack the ballot against anyone they don’t favor. A federal judge last month declared the system unconstitutional for the upcoming primary. Now Katyal’s admirers say they’re enraged by their erstwhile ally’s efforts to snatch away their victory. </p><p>“We are all amazed and disappointed and all the related words,” said Yael Niv of the Good Government Coalition of New Jersey. “He’s on the wrong side of history.” </p><p>Steven Fulop, the mayor of Jersey City and a 2025 Democratic gubernatorial hopeful, told me that “It certainly seems like he’s done a 180 with regard to who he’s fighting for today.” </p><p>Staci Berger, a dissident member of the local Democratic organization in Middlesex County, put it this way: “It’s inappropriate for someone who positions themselves as an advocate for democracy to engage in something that’s abetting voter suppression. … It’s a contradiction and it’s hypocritical.” </p><p>That’s not the sort of reaction typically engendered by Katyal, an acting solicitor general in the Obama administration. With a popular podcast, an MSNBC gig and an active practice arguing crucial cases before the Supreme Court, he’s one of the capital’s most celebrated lawyers — a brilliant litigator and eloquent media presence whose public brand is built on protecting the guardrails of the republic. </p><p>Last year, after Katyal successfully argued against a right-wing effort to gut election oversight, the esteemed judge Michael Luttig said Katyal delivered “the single best oral argument I have ever heard made before the Supreme Court of the United States,” and called it “the single most important constitutional case for American democracy since the nation’s founding.” <br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/53/09/b69275544b5a9050399495f465b2/capitol-riot-investigation-38311.jpg" /><br /><p>No one is likely to ever apply that description to the current litigation over New Jersey’s “county line” ballot system. A one-of-a-kind historic vestige, the system lets local party organizations — the polite term for Democratic or Republican county machines — give their favored candidates top billing on primary-election ballots while consigning everyone else to a kind of ballot-design purgatory. According to <a href="https://www.njpp.org/publications/report/does-the-county-line-matter-an-analysis-of-new-jerseys-2020-primary-election-results/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a 2020 study&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.njpp.org/publications/report/does-the-county-line-matter-an-analysis-of-new-jerseys-2020-primary-election-results/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7bc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7bc0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a 2020 study</a>, being on the line gives machine-approved pols a jaw-dropping advantage in primaries. It also serves to scare off a lot of candidates who might challenge the insiders. </p><p>Democracy advocates have long derided the rule as something out of a banana republic, “an unconstitutional governmental thumb on the scale,” in the words of New Jersey Rep. Andy Kim, the Democratic Senate candidate who filed suit against the “fundamentally unjust and undemocratic” system in February. </p><p>When Kim’s lawsuit prevailed on March 29, it represented a political earthquake in the state — and set off impromptu celebrations among activists who’d fought the system for years and couldn’t quite believe they’d won. </p><p>But instead of joining the celebrations, Katyal joined the other side, filing an amicus brief last Saturday on behalf of the Middlesex County Democratic Organization, one of the state’s venerable local machines. </p><p>Katyal declined comment, saying he was busy preparing for arguments in a gun-control case in San Francisco this week. But his filing does not strike the high notes that might be familiar to those who read his anti-Trump book or watched his successful Supreme Court evisceration of the “independent state legislature” doctrine that could have allowed state legislatures to overturn election results. </p><p>Nonetheless, the brief makes a coherent argument for the old status quo: The line system, Katyal writes, “makes voting more efficient by allowing primary voters to easily identify and quickly vote for all candidates belonging to a single political organization or affiliating with a single slogan.” According to the brief, it’s about protecting “low-information” voters: “Only political junkies learn enough about each primary candidate to make an informed choice about who should be their party’s nominee for Surrogate, township council, or County Clerk.” </p><p>It’s an argument that draws scoffs from attorneys who fought to kill off the system. </p><p>“New Jersey’s primary ballots are a rigged national outlier that offer preferential treatment to certain candidates over others, creating systemic disadvantages that nudge voters, discriminate against candidates and alter electoral outcomes,” said Yael Bromberg, the lawyer representing Kim and a pair of other office-seekers in an effort to forbid the system. “It is one of the last vestiges of machine-style politics in New Jersey, which gives us the unfortunate moniker of the Soprano State.” </p><p>As for the idea that it helps those who haven’t had time to vet the field of candidates, she told me: “They essentially claim that they have a constitutional right to gerrymander the ballot.” </p><p>A federal appeals court may decide soon enough: Arguments are scheduled for April 12 in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, located in Philadelphia. With elections looming, there’s a lot of pressure for a quick decision because ballots need to be printed. </p><p>Alas, the appeals court won’t weigh in on what might be the most interesting aspect of the case for Washington types: Just why would Katyal sign on to a cause that, whatever its legal merits, looks so tawdry and backward? For someone who is genuinely admired in the capital’s legal and media ecosystem, it’s off-brand, to say the least. </p><p>When I reached out, Katyal steered my legal questions to his partner Sean Marotta, who is also working on the case at the Hogan Lovells law firm. Marotta did not respond. Katyal also didn’t respond to a follow-up email about the activists who said they were disappointed to see a pro-democracy ally joining the case on the other side. </p><p>In fact, Katyal wouldn’t be the first superstar political attorney to disappoint his non-lawyer fans. There’s a long history of legal powerhouses earning plaudits for taking cases in the public interest while paying the bills by representing less sympathetic clients. David Boies, for instance, won liberal hearts by leading Al Gore’s recount efforts in Florida in 2000 and going to court for same-sex marriage — and then broke them by playing the heavy on behalf of convicted rapist movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and Silicon Valley fraudster Elizabeth Holmes. <br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/32/a4/84325c02411482751d314686747f/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/51570463" /><br /><p>Katyal himself has never claimed to be a resistance hero, whatever his admirers may want. On social media, he describes himself as an “extremist centrist.” He testified on behalf of the Supreme Court candidacy of Neil Gorsuch. And his choice of clients has caused backlash before. In 2020, he represented Nestle and Cargill in a case involving allegations of child slavery — and he won, successfully arguing that the firms shouldn’t be sued in the U.S. for alleged atrocities that took place in West Africa. </p><p>But what’s different in the county line case is that the subject matter of Katyal’s New Jersey brief is the exact same as the topic of his pro-democracy heroism. Ordinarily, a famous attorney’s public-spirited work (say, getting some poor innocent off death row) concerns a different legal arena than the grubby stuff the same lawyer does to make money (for example, representing an environmental despoiler). With Katyal, his star turn in last year’s independent state legislature showdown and his controversial appearance in the county line litigation both involve the battle to ensure free and fair elections. </p><p>Thus Katyal, who literally represented the good-government group Common Cause in last year’s Supreme Court elections case, finds himself supporting something that the very same organization blasted this week. “When party bosses are able to tip the scale to try to favor certain candidates over others, it distorts voters’ perceptions of who’s running for office and can potentially silence their voices,” Aaron Scherb, the group’s legislative director, told me. “We need a level playing field to ensure that voters can choose candidates based on the merits.” </p><br /><p><br />In Washington, the whole spectacle reflects a tension that has played out in the establishment ever since Donald Trump’s defeat: Was pushing back against election subversion just about thwarting Trump? Or is it part of a larger effort to improve American democracy — a cause that might also include killing a bipartisan New Jersey system that long predates the 45th president? </p><p>In New Jersey, it raises a less cosmic question: Just how is a measly county party organization paying for his services? Katyal charges <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/jj-bankruptcy-trustee-balks-neal-katyals-2465-hourly-rate-2022-05-23/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a reported $2,465 an hour&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/jj-bankruptcy-trustee-balks-neal-katyals-2465-hourly-rate-2022-05-23/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7bc0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7bc0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a reported $2,465 an hour</a>, making him one of America’s priciest legal talents. Forty hours at full freight would cost nearly $100,000. It wouldn’t take long, in other words, to eat through the entire bank account of the Middlesex County Democratic Organization, which had just under $360,000 in cash on hand at the time of its most recent financial report in January. </p><p>The organization declined requests for comment about both its stance on the county line and the financing of its legal team. </p><p>“When your entire business model is at stake for the county parties, of course you will hire a high-profile D.C. attorney to fight your battle for you,” said Antoinette Miles, the state director for the Working Families Party, which filed a previous suit against the county line. Her group works to help progressives win Democratic primaries, an outcome that’s much harder under the county line system. But Miles said the real reason the machines were so eager to preserve the system was about money, not ideology. “Party operatives are looking at this and saying, ‘If I don’t have the party line then how will I maintain my municipal contracts?’” </p><p>In a weird way, money could also be at risk for Katyal — at least the smaller kind of money that comes from book sales and talking-head deals. Along with her own brief in the county line case, Berger, the dissident Middlesex County committee member, forwarded me something that might be more worrying to Katyal’s media agents: A furious letter her mother had sent to MSNBC. The Massachusetts retiree wrote to complain that her favorite network’s legal analyst was defending a “horrendous” practice. </p><p>“Although you have no control over his professional legal career, to me it reduces his credibility,” the letter read. “I am a regular viewer of MSNBC and respected his stance on various legal matters. … His defense of this archaic ballot causes me to reconsider his positions on liberal and/or progressive issues.”</p><br />]]></content:encoded>

Wade</i> nearly two years ago created a patchwork — and ever changing — landscape of abortion access in the United States, with roughly a third of states prohibiting the procedure in nearly all circumstances. That includes almost all of the southeastern United States, after a recent Florida Supreme Court ruling triggered a six-week abortion ban in the state that will take effect May 1 and cut off a key regional access point for the procedure.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a 160-year old aw outlawing abortions at any stage of pregnancy unless the patient’s life is in danger, with no exceptions for rape or incest. That decision could take effect as early as the end of May, though it is unclear how, whether and when the law will be enforced.</p><p>And ongoing litigation in other states, such as Nebraska, Iowa and Utah, could mean more changes to state abortion laws this year.</p><p>Abortion-rights groups are also pushing this year to pass constitutional amendments that would protect abortion access in states like Montana and Nevada and overturn abortion bans in Florida and Missouri.</p><p>Explore the map and table below for more on each state’s abortion laws:<br /></p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

Once the full panel is selected — which could happen by the end of the week — the trial will enter its next stage: opening arguments and the presentation of evidence. The jury will decide whether Trump is guilty of having falsified business records to mask a hush money payment to a porn star who claimed she had a sexual encounter with him. Prosecutors say the cover-up in the final weeks of the 2016 election deprived voters of important information about Trump’s conduct with women.</p><p>Other jurors sworn in Tuesday are a man originally from Puerto Rico who works as an IT consultant, a Harlem woman who works in education and a software engineer who lives in Chelsea.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351055597112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>The seven Manhattanites were selected from an initial crop of 96 prospective jurors who began the jury-selection process on Monday afternoon. Dozens of people were dismissed from the pool outright when they told the judge, Justice Juan Merchan, that they could not be impartial. Others were dismissed after further questioning — with some removed by the judge himself and others removed by the prosecution or defense teams, each of which are entitled to strike a small number of prospective jurors without giving a reason.<br /></p><br /><p>The trial will break on Wednesday and resume Thursday morning with a new batch of prospective jurors.</p><p>In a fitting move for a defendant whose public persona has been crafted in large part by his social media behavior, Trump's lawyers have mined the depths of prospective jurors' social media accounts for potential signs of bias in their years-old comments and memes. Several of them were cut on Tuesday after the judge examined their prior posts.</p><p>Merchan dismissed one man after Trump lawyer Todd Blanche presented a social media post in which the juror wrote, “Good news!! Trump lost his court battle on his unlawful travel ban!!!” along with a suggestion to “lock him up.”</p><p>In other instances, however, Merchan refused Blanche’s effort to kick off certain prospective jurors, including one whose husband shared a post suggesting that the comic book team “The Avengers” unite against Trump.</p><p>Though Trump himself said little during the day’s events, he earned himself his first reprimand from Merchan.</p><p>"Your client was audibly uttering something," Merchan told Blanche after he had finished questioning a prospective juror.</p><p>"I won’t tolerate that,” Merchan said. “I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. I want to make that crystal clear."</p><p>Merchan instructed Blanche to tell Trump to stop his antics. As Merchan spoke, Trump sat slumped in his seat, as though he were sitting in a lounge chair.</p>]]></content:encoded>

After losing the case in district court, Trump appealed the decision to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals and then to the Supreme Court. In July 2020, the Supreme Court ruled against Trump, with Chief Justice John Roberts writing in the majority opinion that “no citizen, not even the President, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding.”</p><p>But though the outcome was a victory for the district attorney’s office, clearing that hurdle didn’t guarantee a direct path to prosecution.</p><p>For one thing, the district attorney’s office was exploring multiple inquiries involving Trump, including whether he may have committed tax, insurance and banking fraud over matters unrelated to the hush money payments.</p><p>And for another, Trump wasn’t done fighting the subpoena. He challenged it again, arguing that it was overly broad. Again, he lost his argument in the lower courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court also rejected his final bid to stop his accounting firm from handing over the financial records.</p><p>Finally, in February 2021, Vance’s prosecutors obtained the documents they’d long been seeking.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">Doubts about a legal theory</h2><p>By this point, Trump was no longer president, having left office one month earlier. And Vance’s office accelerated its investigation, hiring veteran prosecutor Mark Pomerantz to ramp up the Trump probe right around the same time.</p><p>In his first few weeks on the case, Pomerantz decided to focus his efforts on the hush money portion of the district attorney’s sprawling investigation.<br /></p><br /><p>“The return to life of the hush money facts as a potential basis for prosecution sparked a nickname for this part of the investigation: the hush money inquiry came to be known as the ‘zombie’ case, because it was alive, and then it was dead, and now it had sprung back to life,” Pomerantz later wrote in his book, “People v. Donald Trump: An Inside Account.”</p><p>But by March 2021, prosecutors had struggled to settle on a legal theory for charging Trump in the hush money matter. They were concerned that charging him with felonies for falsifying business records might not hold up in court, according to Pomerantz. So it went “back into the grave,” he wrote.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">A sprawling investigation continues</h2><p>On March 12, Vance said he wouldn’t run for reelection and would leave office at the end of the year. He also said internally that before stepping down he would make a decision about whether to charge Trump.</p><p>Over the next few months, the district attorney’s office moved on to other areas of inquiry related to Trump, including looking at whether he had inflated the valuations of his properties — a matter that was eventually brought as a civil case by the New York attorney general’s office — and whether the Trump Organization had doled out untaxed perks to its executives.</p><p>By May, prosecutors began presenting information about the untaxed perks to a grand jury, and by the beginning of July, it had indicted the Trump Organization and its then-CFO Allen Weisselberg.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">New top prosecutor, new approach</h2><p>In November, Vance’s successor, Alvin Bragg, was elected as district attorney.</p><p>Bragg was sworn in in January 2022, and in his initial weeks in office, he hesitated on moving forward with the case related to valuations. And as a result, prosecutors paused their presentation of evidence about Trump to a grand jury. Shortly thereafter, Pomerantz and another top lawyer who had been leading the Trump investigation, Carey Dunne, resigned from the office.<br /></p><br /><p>By the fall, though, Bragg’s office had renewed its interest in the piece of its inquiry that focused on the hush money payment to Daniels. And by January 2023, prosecutors had begun presenting evidence on that case to a new grand jury.</p><p>Over the next two months, the grand jury heard from witnesses including Cohen and Daniels, and prosecutors signaled that they had reached the final stages of their investigation by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/15/stormy-daniels-speaks-to-new-york-prosecutors-as-possible-trump-indictment-looms-00087307" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;offering Trump the opportunity to speak to the grand jury himself&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/15/stormy-daniels-speaks-to-new-york-prosecutors-as-possible-trump-indictment-looms-00087307&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7cc0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7cc0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">offering Trump the opportunity to speak to the grand jury himself</a>.

Aaron Dean, the adjutant general of the D.C. guard at the time, told House Administration Committee staffers that if Trump had reached out that day — which, by all accounts, he did not — he might have helped cut through the chaos amid a tangle of conflicting advice and miscommunication.</p><p>“Could the president have picked up the phone, called the secretary of defense, and said, you know, ‘What’s going on here?’ Our law enforcement is getting overrun, make this happen!’” a committee staffer asked Brooks, according to the transcript of a previously unreported March 14 interview reviewed by POLITICO.</p><p>“I assume he could expedite an approval through the Secretary of Defense, through the Secretary of the Army,” Brooks replied.</p><p>But Trump never called any military leaders on Jan. 6, per testimony from senior administration officials to the Jan. 6 select committee — a fact that the panel emphasized in its final report that concluded Trump was uniquely responsible for the violent Capitol attack by his supporters. Rather, he was observing the riot on TV and calling allies in his quest to subvert the 2020 election, as outlined by committee witnesses and White House records.</p><p>Brooks’ exchange with the committee staffer underscored the reality of Trump’s inaction: “And to your knowledge, did that happen on January 6th?” the staffer continued.</p><p>“No,” Brooks said.</p><p>Dean, similarly, noted that if Trump had placed a call to Pentagon leaders at 2 p.m. — around the time the Capitol was first breached — and said “go,” the guard would have reached the Capitol sooner than it did that day.</p><p>“I think if the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of Defense, or the president had said ‘Go,’ … or a combination thereof had said ‘Go,’ then we would’ve gone and we would’ve been there much faster,” Dean told congressional investigators on March 26.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/dc/4f/38758f43414aabe4de707d38e517/capitol-riot-newspaper-editor-33208.jpg" /><br /><p>Brooks and Dean are among four witnesses slated to testify Wednesday before a House subcommittee probing security failures that exacerbated the breach of the Capitol. All four were top advisers to William Walker, the commander of the D.C. guard on Jan. 6. Other witnesses include Timothy Nick, who was the aide-de-camp to Walker, and Earl Matthews, a top lawyer for the National Guard at the time. POLITICO reviewed transcripts of closed-door interviews that all four men gave to the Administration Committee over the past five weeks.</p><p>The bulk of their testimony focused on deep disagreement between the D.C. guard leadership and the Pentagon about when and whether an order was given to deploy to the Capitol. The witnesses told the Administration Committee that military leaders seemed reluctant to send guard troops to the Capitol until hours after violence had broken out.</p><p>Further, they described mixed messages on phone calls with the Pentagon that left them in a holding pattern, lacking clarity about whether they had permission to deploy. All four also indicated they had testified to the Jan. 6 committee in an “informal” capacity, meaning there were no transcripts of their interviews.</p><p>And they said they had virtually no contact from Ryan McCarthy, the then-Army secretary, even though he was a key player who was in frequent contact with the D.C. guard in the run-up to Jan. 6.</p><p>McCarthy did not respond to a request for comment. He has <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000042158/pdf/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000042158.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;told the Jan. 6 committee&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000042158/pdf/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000042158.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d00001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">told the Jan. 6 committee</a> that a call from Trump would not have hastened the National Guard response because he was already moving as quickly as possible.</p><p>The testimony is the latest addition to a complicated picture of the military’s response to the violence, which raged for hours on Jan. 6 until the D.C. police and National Guard helped the Capitol Police contain it that evening. The riot select committee found that Trump made no calls to senior leaders of the Justice Department, Pentagon or Department of Homeland Security while the violence raged — nor did he reach out to his vice president, Mike Pence, who was sheltering from the mob at the Capitol.</p><p>Rather, Trump watched the riot unfold on TV and made phone calls to lawmakers who he hoped would support his bid to block President Joe Biden’s victory.</p><p>The men, whom the panel described as “whistleblowers,” sharply dispute claims by former Pentagon leaders — from McCarthy to then-Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller to former Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley — that the National Guard was deployed to the Capitol as quickly as possible on Jan. 6.</p><p>Rather, they say, they had no contact from Miller or McCarthy until much later in the day, and they sharply dispute claims that McCarthy authorized the guard’s deployment to the Capitol by 3:04 p.m. on Jan. 6.</p><p>That’s the context in which Brooks and Dean suggested that perhaps a phone call from Trump — as conditions at the Capitol were clearly deteriorating — could have cut through the clutter and resulted in a quicker deployment.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6348435513112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Matthews differed from Brooks and Dean on the question of whether Trump’s involvement could have made a difference. Because Trump had already delegated authority to Miller and McCarthy, there was little for him to do, according to Matthews, who told the Administration Committee that it’s not clear whether McCarthy would have heeded his call.</p><p>“The president wasn’t going to call us because he’s trusting the chain of command,” Matthews told the Administration panel. He noted that some testimony to the Jan. 6 committee underscored concerns among military leaders that Trump might try using a troop presence at the Capitol for nefarious purposes.</p><p>In his testimony to the Jan. 6 committee, McCarthy denied harboring concerns that Trump might misuse the National Guard.</p><p>“I mean, in the lead-up to it, [I] did not see anything that would give you the sense he was going to order us to send troops to the Capitol in support of anything untoward,” McCarthy said.</p><p>In a statement Matthews issued ahead of his public testimony, he elaborated on his belief.</p><p>“The committee knew that even if President Trump had called down personally to the Secretary of the Army, who had effective operational control of the D.C. National Guard, to direct the immediate movement of the Guard, it would have had no impact.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

The store was the site of a 2022 fatal stabbing, which the perpetrator described as self defense against an unprovoked attack in a case that inflamed conservatives.</p><p>The appearance signaled an effort by Trump to go on the offensive after two days besieged in court, while kneecapping Alvin Bragg, the Democratic prosecutor trying his case. Unfolding on the sidelines of the trial, the brief remarks served as the opening of the weeks-long, courtroom-constricted phase of Trump’s campaign — a relentless critique of Democrats’ handling of crime to counter public focus on his own criminal cases.</p><p>“It’s Alvin Bragg’s fault. Alvin Bragg does nothing; he goes after guys like Trump who did nothing wrong,” Trump told reporters gathered outside the store. “There are hundreds of murderers all over the city. They know who they are, and they don’t pick them up. They go after Trump.”</p><p>He used the opportunity to similarly go after the influx of migrants into New York City, seeking to pit them against Black and Latino residents and going so far as to predict he would win New York — an unlikely outcome, as no Republican presidential candidate has carried the state in 30 years.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/2d/f9/4f68025445aa95a736f5343da816/img-0103.jpg" /><br /><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/17/63/3ad8db144e3ea6025a47e9f7371d/img-0107.jpg" /><br /><p>Anticipating the attack on his record, <a href="https://twitter.com/manhattanda/status/1780329213095981199?s=46" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Bragg’s office tweeted NYPD statistics&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/manhattanda/status/1780329213095981199?s=46&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d40002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d40003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Bragg’s office tweeted NYPD statistics</a> showing a 39 percent drop in shootings and a 23 percent drop in murders over the past year in Manhattan. </p><p>Trump, flanked by Bodega and Small Business Group member Carlos Collado and the bodega’s owner, Maad Ahmed, called his trial “rigged” and said of the judge overseeing his case, “There’s never been a judge so conflicted as this.”</p><p>The presumptive GOP presidential nominee spent much of Tuesday in court, before the trip to the bodega where clerk Jose Alba fatally stabbed a customer who was attacking him in a case that captured the attention of Republicans nationally. Alba was initially charged with murder, but Bragg later dropped the charges.</p><p>“This matter was resolved nearly two years ago, and the charges were dismissed after a thorough investigation,” Bragg spokesperson Doug Cohen said. “DA Bragg’s top priority remains combating violent crime and the office has worked hand in hand with the NYPD to drive down overall crime in Manhattan, including double digit decreases in homicides and shootings since he took office.”</p><p>Trump’s visit put him on Bragg’s turf — the neighborhood that raised the top prosecutor, after two days in a courtroom where he is being tried on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351055597112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Trump’s campaign permitted several dozen supporters to pack into a space near the bodega, where they cheered him loudly, chanted, “Four more years!” and sang, “The Star-Spangled Banner.” He greeted them warmly before heading into the store for a few minutes. </p><p>Beyond the police barricades, hundreds of New Yorkers crowded to watch the spectacle. And while some appeared to support Trump, others booed him. Just after his motorcade took off, a group arrived with a sense of humor and a banner advertising, “Trump dildos on sale now.”</p><p>The incident highlighted the complications of running for president while on trial.</p><p>The drama unfolding in the Manhattan courtroom and the trial’s demands on the former president’s schedule are not welcome by the candidate or his campaign<b>, </b>which has sought repeatedly to delay the trial. But Trump has decided to make the most of it, using it to underscore his claims that the justice system is unfairly rigged against him and that he is the victim of political persecution.<br /></p><br /><p>Trump's campaign has also worked closely with his allies to make sure they are blanketing the airwaves with talking points that tie the trial to President Joe Biden. Surrogates have been asked to call this the "Biden trials," a phrase the former president has used himself as he railed against the proceedings on Truth Social.</p><p>On the social media site on Tuesday, Trump wrote, “MY TRIAL IS AN ASSAULT ON AMERICA!”</p><p>Democrats, readily on the defensive over crime and border security, have sought to play up their electoral advantage on abortion — tying Republicans and Trump, specifically, to what have proven to be unpopular restrictions since the overturning of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>.</p><p>Trump’s appearance Tuesday also served as a preview of the way he is likely to campaign for the duration of the proceedings. On Trump's days off from the trial — Wednesday, when the judge attends to other business, and the weekends — he plans to attend fundraisers and continue campaigning. This weekend he will attend a fundraiser and rally in North Carolina. And like he did on Tuesday, he is expected to have unannounced stops in the New York area to talk about immigration and crime. </p><p>On Tuesday, he told reporters he will do rallies “all over the place” during the trial.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/f5/8e/61a0e27f45578db6f5c3d836720e/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2147853732" /><br /><p>Despite Trump’s claims of increased crime in New York City, NYPD statistics show overall crime fell 1 percentage point from 2022 to 2023.

The setting, a bodega where a man was fatally stabbed in 2022, certainly was. And maybe Trump’s freewheeling performance was, too.</p><p>But not far from where he rode <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/06/14/donald-trump-campaign-announcement-tower-escalator-oral-history-227148/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;down the escalator&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/06/14/donald-trump-campaign-announcement-tower-escalator-oral-history-227148/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d80002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d80003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">down the escalator</a> on his way to the White House in 2015, Trump’s appearance on Tuesday was a reminder of Trump’s ability not only to manufacture a sideshow, but to turn it into the main act — more Trump the thirsty tabloid character than Trump the former president or Trump the accused.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351100473112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>And if the opening two days of Trump’s criminal trial exposed the cost to his presidential campaign of his confinement to a New York courtroom, his bodega visit laid bare the opportunities.</p><p>“There’s something to be said for him believing that this trial — and the timing of this trial — could have a reverse effect on silencing him,” said Alice Stewart, a Republican strategist and veteran of past presidential campaigns. “Hours on end in a courtroom are tiring and excruciating. But once he’s outside the courtroom, he’s able to make up for lost time.”<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/d2/37/5b9b643d42759fa31d378b5fc273/useuntil-05-16-2024-trumptrial-026.jpg" /><br /><p>On Tuesday, Trump said he will “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/trump-bodega-alvin-bragg/index.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;campaign locally&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/trump-bodega-alvin-bragg/index.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d80004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d80005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">campaign locally</a>” during the trial. And the bodega visit was likely just the first of many such appearances. His advisers have said, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/13/trump-campaign-plans-trial-00152070" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;even on some trial days, to expect in-person and virtual events&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/13/trump-campaign-plans-trial-00152070&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d90001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">even on some trial days, to expect in-person and virtual events</a>. This week, it was almost like a “Trump for governor” or “Trump for mayor” campaign that never was — the whole episode barely connected to the idea of the presidency.</p><p>“Everything is screwed up in New York,” Trump said, “and the whole world is watching.”</p><p>It was a stretch for Trump to say that he will “make a heavy play for New York,” a state that has not voted for a Republican for president since 1984, and one where Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/new-york/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;lost to now-President Joe Biden by more than 23 percentage points in 2020&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/new-york/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d90002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d90003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">lost to now-President Joe Biden by more than 23 percentage points in 2020</a>.</p><p>But as he spoke with reporters in New York, a bastion of Democratic politics, Trump’s read of the news landscape — if not the political one — seemed spot on. In the media capital of the world, Trump said he suspected there was “more press here than there is if I went out to some nice location.”</p><p>“He’s right,” said Dave Catalfamo, a Republican consultant in New York.</p><p>Trump’s prosecutors had given Trump a “platform,” Catalfamo said, and the former president “takes advantage of his masterfully.”</p><p>“The way we consume our news now, and the way that he gets covered, he’s utilizing the stage that’s before him,” Catalfamo said.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/fa/ec/dcd60f0544c0bcdd5635ebe6ea6f/useuntil-05-16-2024-trumptrial-018.jpg" /><br /><p>The substance of Trump’s visit was a throwback to Trump’s messaging in the 2020 campaign, when, following the anti-police protests in the wake of George Floyd’s murder — and in an effort to replicate the Nixonian “law and order” rhetoric of half a century ago — he laced into Democrats for crime in the nation’s largest, Democratic-run cities.</p><p>But now, amid Trump’s own legal entanglements, the subject served another purpose for him — casting doubt on the legal system, much as he did the electoral system in 2020, portraying his accusers as partisans in an effort to discredit them.</p><p>Outside the bodega, Trump called his trial “rigged” and said of the judge overseeing his case, “There’s never been a judge so conflicted as this.”</p><p>Trump has repeatedly claimed that Justice Juan Merchan has conflicts of interest, and Trump's lawyers have unsuccessfully asked the judge to step down from the case. Last year, a New York judicial ethics panel <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/ipjudicialethicsopinions/23-54.htm" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;rejected Trump's allegations&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nycourts.gov/ipjudicialethicsopinions/23-54.htm&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d90004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d90005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">rejected Trump's allegations</a> that Merchan is biased, concluding “the judge's impartiality cannot reasonably be questioned.”<br /></p><br /><p>There’s reason to think Trump may be having some success in this line of critique. Earlier this week, an <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/as-trumps-hush-money-case-begins-about-a-third-believe-he-has-done-something-illegal/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apnorc.org/projects/as-trumps-hush-money-case-begins-about-a-third-believe-he-has-done-something-illegal/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d90006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d90007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll</a> found 44 percent of Americans are “not very” or “not at all” confident that prosecutors in New York are treating Trump fairly, and another 22 percent who are only “somewhat confident” they are.</p><p>But no matter where viewers stood on Trump, they could at least see in his appearance on Tuesday the kind of joy-riding former president they recognized.</p><p>That is in sharp contrast to his time in court, which by most accounts has been a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/16/trump-trial-reality-criminal-defendant-00152421" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;comedown for him&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/16/trump-trial-reality-criminal-defendant-00152421&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d90008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7d90009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">comedown for him</a>.

Trump advisers concede they will have less money than Biden, who has established a formidable fundraising apparatus. But they insist they will have enough to compete.</p><p>Over the first three months of the year, Trump’s Save America Joint Fundraising Committee, which has been the primary fundraising vehicle for his presidential bid, reported transferring $33.8 million to his campaign, including $14.7 million in March that had not been previously reported. Trump’s campaign will file its own report later this week for March, but the joint committee usually accounts for nearly all of its cash flow.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351030867112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>The joint fundraising committee also burned through $21 million on fundraising expenses over three months, which reduced what it had left to send to Trump’s campaign. Expenses included $7.2 million in fundraising fees paid to the Virginia-based firm Active Engagement, as well as $3.2 million spent on direct mail and $2 million on merchant fees.</p><p>The joint committee also raises money for Trump’s Save America leadership PAC, although it did not report any transfers to that group in the first quarter.</p><p>But the former president’s initial team-up with the Republican National Committee raked in big bucks, with a new joint fundraising committee, Trump 47 Committee, raising $23 million.</p><p>The committee’s fundraising was driven by large donors, many of whom are familiar Republican donors but had not given to the RNC yet this cycle. Eighteen donors gave at least $800,000 to the joint committee, accounting for 62 percent of its fundraising. Among those who maxed out were Robert Bigelow, the Nevada real estate magnate who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/08/desantis-trump-2024-00126054" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;formerly backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/08/desantis-trump-2024-00126054&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7de0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f4a6-ddbd-adef-f7bfb7de0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">formerly backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis</a>, former Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) and former Trump administration official Linda McMahon. The list also includes hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, who was a prominent supporter of Trump’s 2016 campaign. The former president has been working of late to cultivate the backing of Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah.</p><p>Only $6,600 that any donor gives to the joint fundraising committee can go to Trump’s campaign. So the big checks also meant big funds headed to the RNC, which can accept far more from large donors. Trump 47 Committee reported transferring $10.3 million to the RNC in the last few days of March, a major boost from the group that had raised just $10.6 million from all sources the month prior.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351034368112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Under its joint fundraising formula, Trump 47 Committee is also set to send money to Trump’s leadership PAC, Save America, and a range of state Republican parties, though it reported no such transfers in March.</p><p>The new reports include all activity through March 31. But many Trump-aligned groups, including the former president’s official campaign, are on a different filing schedule and aren’t required to disclose their activity for the month of March until Saturday.</p><p>Trump has been intensifying his courtship of major donors and has been regularly dialing up givers who have remained on the sidelines. Earlier this month, he held a fundraiser at the home of billionaire investor John Paulson that his campaign said raised more than $50 million. Last week, he traveled to Atlanta to hold another fundraising event.</p><p>Trump’s campaign last month executed a hostile takeover of the RNC, which had trailed its Democratic counterpart in fundraising. As part of the restructuring, the Trump team is moving the RNC fundraising apparatus from Washington to West Palm Beach, Florida, where the campaign is based.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ahead of the November elections, he has spoken with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, dined with British foreign secretary David Cameron, and met with Argentine President Javier Milei and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, according to two people familiar with the talks.
