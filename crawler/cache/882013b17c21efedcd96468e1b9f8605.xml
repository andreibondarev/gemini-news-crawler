Fearing a coming flood of cheap Chinese cars produced south of the border, the former president and his advisers are planning to impose steep auto tariffs on Mexico if it does not agree to halt the shipment of Chinese-made EVs into the U.S., according to federal lawmakers and three former Trump administration officials with knowledge of his plans.</p><p>The duties on Mexican autos — coming in addition to Trump’s oft-repeated plans for a 10 percent tariffs on all foreign imports and 60 percent duties on China — would amount to a major escalation of trade conflicts with both Beijing and Mexico City that could upend auto supply chains across the continent. Those plans contrast sharply with Biden’s more surgical approach to tariffs, which is expected to have only muted effects on the U.S. economy, since the U.S. imports relatively few electric vehicles or the other products subject to tariffs from China itself today.</p><p>The diverging proposals underscore fundamental disagreements between the two men over how much to roil the global trading system, even as they both try to prioritize domestic workers and manufacturers. And they highlight an important fault line in what’s emerging as a defining debate in the 2024 presidential contest.</p><p>“I will put a 200 percent tax on every car that comes in from those plants,” Trump said at a rally in New Jersey on Saturday, referring to his plans to impose trade restrictions on Chinese-made autos from Mexico.</p><p>Trump’s comments are more than just campaign bluster. Those close to Trump say he and informal policy advisers like his ex-trade chief Robert Lighthizer are actively planning to impose tariffs on cars from Mexico, if that country’s government — which will be in new hands after a June 2024 election — does not agree to stem the tide of cheap Chinese cars. Those tariffs could hit just Chinese-made vehicles from Mexico — coming from companies like BYD, which plans to build plants in the country — or be applied more broadly on all imports from south of the border, said the figures close to the former president, granted anonymity to discuss policy plans.</p><p>“I’ve talked to the former president himself about this,” said Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/307631" data-person-id="307631" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715651623458,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d9-d0a8-a59b-ffd93d630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715651623458,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d9-d0a8-a59b-ffd93d630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;307631\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/307631\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Sen.

They are concerned — like the Trump advisers — that Chinese companies will ship cars through Mexico to avoid the tariffs on EVs from China first imposed by Trump, which Biden will quadruple today.</p><p>“Tariffs are not enough,” Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51301" data-person-id="51301" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715651660624,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d9-d0a8-a59b-ffd93d630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715651660624,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d9-d0a8-a59b-ffd93d630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;51301\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51301\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH)\&quot;,\&quot;isCommittee\&quot;:false}&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Sherrod Brown&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51301&quot;,&quot;personId&quot;:&quot;51301&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-74ce-d3f6-a5ff-77deba3f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;353fe80b-e1b5-3663-85ca-add066ecafc0&quot;}">Sherrod Brown</a> (D-Ohio) said on social media last week. “We need to ban Chinese EVs from the U.S., period.”</p><h2 style="text-align: left">A “hugely disruptive” agenda</h2><p>High tariffs or an outright ban could indeed stop a flood of cheap Chinese EVs from swamping U.S. markets, as many in the American auto industry fear. But they would also trigger a major row with the U.S.’s largest trading partner, and — depending on how broadly tariffs are applied — significant disruptions to auto supply chains and dramatic increases in the price of cars.</p><p>The U.S. imports about 2.6 million cars from Mexico each year — about one-seventh of the cars sold in the country each year — said Ed Gresser, a former assistant U.S. trade Representative for trade policy and economics. If all of those cars are hit with tariffs, the price for all vehicles in the U.S. “would go up really high.”</p><p>It would also be “hugely disruptive” to the U.S. automotive industry in states like Michigan and Ohio, which rely on imported parts from Mexico, said Bill Reinsh, the former under secretary of commerce for export administration during the Clinton administration.</p><p>Automakers have “spent a lot of time developing supply chains that are designed to accommodate the existing rules,” he said. “When you come in suddenly and just throw all the rules away, basically, you're telling them once again, you have to totally reorient your supply chains.”</p><p>Advisers close to Trump stress that policy plans are still evolving and that both the level and legal justification for tariffs — like whether to impose them under national security authority or other reasons — are still under consideration. But the ultimate tariff number is not as important, they say, as the simple desire to block Chinese-made autos from using Mexico as a back door to evade tariffs.</p><p>Trump’s tariff threat “sounds like a very large number, but the symbolism you can take from that is that the [tariff] would effectively be a lockout fee,” said one former Trump administration official with knowledge of the conversations, granted anonymity to reflect policy discussions. “We just don’t want these cars and parts coming into the United States.”</p><h2 style="text-align: left">Biden’s more modest approach</h2><p>Trump’s threat to slap tariffs on autos from Mexico is just one piece of a broader trade agenda that would use tariffs to erect a wall around American industrial sectors — and, by extension, consumers. Trump, who once described himself as a "Tariff Man," and his advisers are mulling a 10 percent tariff on all imports coming into the U.S. and a much higher levy on all goods on China, perhaps as high as 60 percent.</p><p>Biden aides on Monday tried to draw a sharp distinction between those sort of indiscriminate tariffs and their strategic use of trade barriers — which they said are focused on protecting domestic clean energy production.</p><p>Biden’s approach “contrasts with proposals to impose an across-the-board tariff on all goods from all countries that would raise costs by $1500 per year on each American family,” national economic adviser Lael Brainard said.</p><p>White House officials say they targeted Chinese sectors for tariffs that compete with American industries that the Biden administration has sought to support. As part of those efforts, tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles will quadruple to 100 percent, while duties on Chinese solar cells will double to 50 percent. Tariffs on semiconductors will double to 50 percent, and those on batteries will more than triple to 25 percent. Tariffs on medical syringes will go from zero to 50 percent, and duties on other medical goods will increase as well.</p><p>The volume of imports affected by the moves underscores the relatively minor impact on overall trade flows: The U.S. imported $427 billion from China last year, but Biden’s moves would affect only about $18 billion of imports, the White House said.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/98/46/efb3da9044c6bc72abdf94df9872/biden-99999.jpg" /><br /><p>Instead, administration officials positioned the tariffs as largely preemptive — an attempt to stave off a coming flood of cheap Chinese EVs, solar panels and batteries that could out-compete U.S. companies. The Biden administration has made supporting domestic clean energy manufacturing a centerpiece of its economic agenda, aiming to take production back from China through tax incentives like those in the <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_117_HR_5376" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715652046358,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d9-d0a8-a59b-ffd93d630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715652046358,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d9-d0a8-a59b-ffd93d630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_117_HR_5376&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-74d4-d7a0-a9af-f5f79ff60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Inflation Reduction Act&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-74d4-d7a0-a9af-f5f79ff50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Inflation Reduction Act</a>.</p><p>“There's no inflationary impact of these actions,” a senior administration official said. “They are mainly targeting strategic sectors where we are ramping up domestic investment.”</p><h2 style="text-align: left">USMCA at stake</h2><p>No matter who prevails in November, the issue of auto tariffs is expected to be a major point of contention when the U.S., Mexico and Canada meet in 2026 to renegotiate the free trade deal Trump helped broker in his first term. Chinese companies like BYD — the largest EV producer in the world — have already announced plans to build production plants in Mexico, which could allow them to avoid the new 100 percent tariff on Chinese EVs by shipping them through Mexico.</p><p>“The [factory] investments we're talking about are going to be Chinese-owned companies, and they're gonna be Mexican-origin autos,” meaning that the imported cars would pay tariffs of only 2.5 percent, said another former Trump administration official with knowledge of the conversations. “There’s a gap in the [tariff] architecture.”</p><p>The former Trump administration officials say that there’s room to negotiate, however. The Mexican government may be able to avoid high tariffs by negotiating a change to the automotive rules in the North American trade pact, known as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement or USMCA, to block Chinese companies from selling into the U.S. market.</p><p>“Let's try to work up some way so that our industry and [Mexican] industry can both succeed and we don't all get wiped out by China,” said a third former Trump administration official with knowledge of internal planning.</p><p>But the Mexican government is unlikely to want to open the deal up for review, said Kenneth Smith Ramos, a former USMCA negotiator for Mexico. No matter which candidate wins in the June elections, there is a “consensus on the importance of maintaining the USMCA.”</p><p>Opening up the agreement to renegotiation would “open up Pandora’s box,” Ramos said, because there “will be even more protectionist calls” from the Trump administration on topics like agriculture, textiles and energy, in addition to autos.</p><p>“That's a dangerous proposition,” he said. “Our recommendation is don't try to reopen the agreement but start a conversation with the U.S. and Canada as to how as a region we're going to address the China question.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

This might ordinarily be a welcome development for him — but the problem is that they are not doing a particularly good job defending him.</p><p>Put simply, Trump’s legal team has made several considerable, and at times baffling, missteps over the course of the trial that have increased the odds of a conviction.</p><p>Adding to the strangeness of all this is the fact that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/26/trump-criminal-defense-team-prosecutor-00118258" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Trump’s defense team&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/26/trump-criminal-defense-team-prosecutor-00118258&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67990002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67990003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Trump’s defense team</a> is probably the strongest group that he has assembled in any of his various legal proceedings to date. The principal lawyers are experienced criminal litigators who, as a group, are moderately to very well regarded among New York City’s white-collar bar.</p><p>At the moment, it’s impossible to know for sure how Trump will ultimately fare in the case. The trial is now likely to turn in large part on the jury’s assessment of Michael Cohen’s credibility, which has always been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/18/poll-conviction-trump-2024-elections-00147338" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the central risk&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/18/poll-conviction-trump-2024-elections-00147338&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67990004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67990005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the central risk</a> for prosecutors.</p><p>But it’s also clear that Trump’s lawyers are pursuing a flawed and risky strategy. Why? Most likely it’s not them, but him. Trump is the client, and he gets the final word on major decisions.

That was followed by days of testimony last week that — if you believe Daniels’ very persuasive account — effectively demonstrated that a central plank of Trump’s defense is a lie and has been a lie for years, and that the jury cannot trust even Trump’s lead counsel to tell them the truth.</p><p><a href="" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;A bunch of &quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67990006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67990007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">A bunch of</a><a href="https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/opinion-potomac-watch/stormy-daniels-testifies-at-donald-trumps-hush-money-trial/615ccbde-0f62-4fda-a367-7edc0a017066" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Trump-supporting&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/opinion-potomac-watch/stormy-daniels-testifies-at-donald-trumps-hush-money-trial/615ccbde-0f62-4fda-a367-7edc0a017066&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67990008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67990009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Trump-supporting</a> legal commentators <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/07/opinion/judge-allows-stormy-daniels-to-give-irrelevant-salacious-testimony-just-to-humiliate-trump/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;have claimed&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nypost.com/2024/05/07/opinion/judge-allows-stormy-daniels-to-give-irrelevant-salacious-testimony-just-to-humiliate-trump/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d6799000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d6799000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">have claimed</a> that Daniels’ testimony <a href="https://radio.foxnews.com/2024/05/07/andrew-mccarthy-stormy/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;was irrelevant&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://radio.foxnews.com/2024/05/07/andrew-mccarthy-stormy/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d6799000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d6799000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">was irrelevant</a> to the case — a truly baffling interpretation of events given what actually happened.

And his weekend rally on a boardwalk along the Jersey shore — while drawing a sea of thousands upon thousands of red MAGA caps — likely did not generate six-figure attendance numbers. But despite Cohen offering potentially damning testimony against him in court — the place he has been confined for much of the last month — Trump’s overall political prospects on Monday hardly appeared grim.</p><p>And the former president’s demeanor during the day’s court proceeding was markedly different than last week, when porn star Stormy Daniels testified.

For hours, Trump took in the testimony with his eyes shut, nearly reactionless, moving only occasionally to scratch an itch, whisper or pass a note to his attorney, read a document or glance at the computer monitor in front of him before going back to his shut-eye pose.</p><p>Across the room, Cohen, the state’s top witness, was seeking to make the case against the former president, calmly delivering his testimony as the district attorney’s office, but not yet Trump’s lawyers, questioned him extensively about his years-long role as a personal attorney and fixer for Trump. Cohen spoke of “tasks” that he said he carried out at Trump’s request to protect Trump’s financial, personal and political interests, recalling details like Trump’s comment that a Playboy model he reportedly had an affair with was “really beautiful,” and a porn star he had sex with was a “beautiful woman.”<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352859510112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Such a trial against a former president is historic and unprecedented, and it has disrupted Trump’s ability to campaign, constraining him to a courtroom for days on end over the past month. But it’s also a criminal case that Americans already see as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-indictment-hush-money-poll-b3d9a555993faf22e6ebfaf798bfbd2b" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715639127390,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715639127390,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-indictment-hush-money-poll-b3d9a555993faf22e6ebfaf798bfbd2b&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-740f-d3f6-a5ff-77df83780001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;weaker than Trump’s other legal woes&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-740f-d3f6-a5ff-77df83780000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">weaker than Trump’s other legal woes</a>. And despite headline news about the trial continuing for nearly a month now — and economic conditions improving for Biden — Trump’s lead in battleground polls hasn’t budged.</p><p>Monday’s testimony came on the heels of his massive weekend campaign rally, in which he drew thousands of supporters to Wildwood, New Jersey, a conservative area in the Democratic state. It’s the latest in a series of blue-state visits Trump is making as he argues, with limited to no polling evidence, that his lead against Biden is so strong that states like New York, Virginia and Minnesota are also in play for him this year.</p><p>Trump is scheduled to speak at a GOP fundraising dinner in Minnesota on Friday — a day the judge has agreed to cancel court so he can attend his son’s high school graduation in Florida — before traveling to Dallas on Saturday to speak at a National Rifle Association convention.</p><p>But before Trump returns to the campaign trail this weekend, he’ll have to withstand additional critical testimony from Cohen — perhaps spanning as long as two more days. And despite the subdued demeanor of both Trump and Cohen on Monday, tensions could still flare between the two former allies. Both men had taken to publicly eviscerating the other ahead of trial, until the judge instructed each to stop.</p><p>The Trump defense team’s cross-examination of Cohen will likely be designed to elicit a much different response than the measured, reasonable-sounding testimony the prosecution wants jurors to hear from Cohen.</p><p>Cohen, a convicted felon who served time in federal prison related to Trump hush money payments and other crimes, has admitted to lying under oath on multiple occasions, including to Congress.

And there’s the social media resistance hero he became after breaking with his former boss, lobbing insults at Trump with the same expletive-laden fury he used to reserve for Trump’s enemies.</p><p>On Monday, the jury in Trump’s Manhattan hush money trial met a third, one who seemed to manifest in real time on the witness stand: mild-mannered, self-deprecating, just-the-facts-ma’am. (In fact, he said ma’am more than 100 times when addressing prosecutor Susan Hoffinger.)</p><p>It was a reinvention that could define and even determine the outcome of Trump’s criminal trial, in which the former president is charged with orchestrating a scheme to prevent porn star Stormy Daniels from revealing an extramarital affair on the cusp of his 2016 presidential victory.</p><p>That’s because Cohen, while recasting himself, also revealed perhaps the most damaging bit of evidence yet: a meeting just days before Trump assumed the Oval Office, in which, according to Cohen, Trump reviewed and endorsed a plan to reimburse him for paying off Daniels.</p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352859510112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><br />That is a critical piece of testimony because the alleged reimbursement scheme — and records related to it — are at the crux of the 34 felony charges against Trump. Prosecutors say that Trump, while reimbursing Cohen, falsified the reimbursement as a series of legal expenses in violation of New York law. And Cohen’s description of the January 2017 Trump Tower meeting is the first piece of direct evidence to suggest that Trump personally green-lit the scheme.</p><p>But it is also a tricky piece of evidence for prosecutors, because the jury may need to rely solely on Cohen’s account of it.</p><p>In Cohen’s telling, only three people attended the meeting: Cohen, Trump and former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. Of those three, two — Cohen and Weisselberg — are convicted felons with a history of dishonesty. Weisselberg is currently serving jail time for perjury and appears unlikely to testify in the trial. Trump is under no obligation to testify in his own defense, which would open him up to cross-examination. And if he did testify, he would surely dispute Cohen’s version of the meeting — or deny that it happened at all.</p><p>That means prosecutors need the 12 jurors to trust Cohen, and Cohen alone, on what really happened in that meeting in which a significant chapter of the cover-up was purportedly written.</p><p>That’s where Cohen’s efforts to rebrand himself inside the Manhattan courthouse came into play. For nearly six hours, Cohen displayed uncharacteristic modesty, dispassion and a measured temperament, even while he acknowledged his former bouts of anger, bullying, lying and egotism.</p><p>For example, he recalled seething when he was told Trump would not consider him to be his White House chief of staff in 2017. (“It was more about my ego than anything,” Cohen recalled.)</p><p>He said he never sought to be a lawyer, crediting his grandmother for coaxing him into the profession in part because his family was full of doctors and lawyers. (“I wanted to go to Wall Street,” he said.)</p><p>And most significantly, Cohen acknowledged becoming incensed when at the end of 2016 — a year in which Cohen orchestrated deals to silence at least two women from disclosing extramarital affairs with Trump and even fronted $130,000 of his own money to cover the payment to Daniels — he received a bonus check that was slashed by two-thirds from the year before. And Trump hadn’t even paid back the $130,000 yet.</p><p>“Even for me, I was unusually angry,” he said, prompting chuckles in the press gallery, where many are acquainted with Cohen’s rage.</p><br /><p><br />In his fury, Cohen said, he confronted Weisselberg. “I actually did a double take and then immediately went to Mr. Weisselberg’s office in the back and in some uncolorful language expressed to him how truly pissed off and angry I really was,” Cohen recalled.</p><p>Weisselberg, he said, promised he would help “make this right.” “Take it easy, you know that Mr. Trump loves you,” Cohen recalled Weisselberg telling him.</p><p>Just days before Trump took the oath of office on Jan. 20, 2017, Cohen said, the three of them assembled in Trump’s corporate office. There, with Trump looking on, Cohen said Weisselberg outlined a plan to pay Cohen back in monthly installments for the money he had shelled out to suppress Daniels’ story — as well as some other costs Cohen had incurred — and then nearly doubled it to cover Cohen’s tax liability as well.</p><p>Hoffinger asked if Weisselberg showed Trump a handwritten document laying out the repayment plan.</p><p>“Yes,” Cohen replied.</p><p>And Hoffinger asked if Weisselberg said, in Trump’s presence, that the payments would be recorded as a retainer for legal services.</p><p>“Yes,” Cohen said.</p><p>Cohen said Trump backed the plan and added a sweetener: agreeing to name him “personal counsel to the president,” a title Cohen said he planned to monetize as a consultant.</p><p>Despite Cohen’s mild demeanor on the witness stand, he did offer some tantalizing pieces of testimony.</p><p>Cohen told jurors that when he sought to negotiate a deal with Daniels, Trump instructed him to “just get past the election, because if I win, it will have no relevance because I'll be president, and if I lose, no one will care.”</p><p>That assertion bolsters prosecutors’ theory of the case: that the payoff to Daniels was a form of election interference that deprived voters of information and violated election laws. Trump’s lawyers have suggested that the motive for the payoff was not political, but merely to protect Trump’s family from embarrassment.</p><p>But Cohen said that when he asked how Daniels’ claims might affect Trump’s relationship with Melania, Trump told him, “Don’t worry."</p><p>"He goes, ‘How long do you think I’ll be on the market for? Not long,'" Cohen recounted.</p><p>"He wasn’t thinking about Melania,” Cohen said. “This was all about the campaign.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

The match-up will test whether Trone’s money can overpower the Maryland Democratic machine, which is backing Alsobrooks.</p><p>The primary contest is rooted in delicate questions of personal identity surrounding race and gender. Alsobrooks would be the first Black senator in Maryland history and has led Maryland’s second most-populous county for more than a decade. But Trone and his allies have questioned Alsobrooks’ qualifications, with one of his allies saying in an ad that she would need “training wheels.” That attack drew fierce criticism from Black women and others who called it offensive.</p><p>In a typical election cycle, the Democratic nominee would cruise to victory in Maryland, where Democrats hold a 2-to-1 voter registration advantage. But the nominee this year will likely face off against former Gov. Larry Hogan, a moderate Republican who is arguably the state’s most popular figure.</p><p>Even if Hogan ultimately falls short, his mere presence in the general election could force national Democrats to siphon money away from other critical Senate seats they need to hold in Ohio, Montana and elsewhere as they try to defend a razor-thin majority.</p><p>Let’s break down three major reasons to watch Maryland’s primary contest.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">Who's David and who is Goliath? The race is a test of money vs. machine.</h2><p>Each campaign is seeking to paint the other as the Goliath in the race. And arguably, they’re both right.</p><p>Trone is <i>rich </i>rich. The co-founder of Total Wine and More, Trone has said he is willing to spend what is necessary to win the seat. He single-handedly made this contest the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/most-expensive-races" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;most-expensive Senate race&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/most-expensive-races&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67c10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67c10001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">most-expensive Senate race</a> in state history by dumping some $55 million of his personal fortune into the primary, much of it on TV ads that began blanketing the state more than a year before the primary election.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/d1/a2/d035269744f992fc2fd720edbd95/u-s-congress-23834.jpg" /><br /><p>But Alsobrooks has a claim to the Goliath title, too. She’s got the endorsements of all but one member of the Maryland congressional delegation, and the backing of Democratic star-on-the-rise Gov. Wes Moore. She also has been a top elected official in voter-rich Prince George’s County, a majority-Black and wealthy suburb of Washington, D.C., since 2018 and prior to that she served as the state’s attorney for the county. In the closing weeks of the campaign, Alsobrooks snagged the backing of the legendary retired Sen. Barbara Mikulski and the endorsement of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/18/endorsement-angela-alsobrooks-maryland-senate-democrats/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;The Washington Post&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/18/endorsement-angela-alsobrooks-maryland-senate-democrats/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67c10002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67c10003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">The Washington Post</a> editorial board.</p><p>So both campaigns have significant strengths, and the race will test the power of the political machine against Trone’s massive money advantage. Trone appears to have maintained a healthy lead on Alsobrooks throughout the primary, according to the <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/senate/democratic-primary/2024/maryland" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Real Clear Politics polling average&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/senate/democratic-primary/2024/maryland&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67c10004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67c10005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Real Clear Politics polling average</a>, though Alsobrooks' campaign maintains it has surged in the closing weeks. Will her late push be enough to overcome Trone’s ads running on repeat in the state?</p><h2 style="text-align: left">Race has permeated the campaign. Things have gotten very messy.</h2><p>Race and gender were always important in the contest between a white man and a Black woman. And the closing stretch of the primary has veered even harder into issues of race.</p><p>Alsobrooks staked much of her campaign on history: Not only has Maryland only ever elected white senators, its current federal delegation is entirely male. There have only ever been three Black women in the United States Senate, and many Democrats saw this as an easy path to add another.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/37/8d/598c38eb4a13887ddc03ab195a0b/election-2024-maryland-senate-hogan-61135.jpg" /><br /><p>Maryland has no shortage of Black elected officials, and about one-third of its population is Black.

So instead of bucking the establishment, she’s got its full backing. If she comes up short, there will be lots to sort out, because while money plays a huge role, Trone also repeatedly stumbled on race, providing lots of openings for her to close the gap.</p><p>In March, Trone used a racial slur during a Congressional hearing, attempting to say “bugaboo” but instead <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/03/21/david-trone-congress-racial-insult/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;using a similar-sounding and dated slur&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/03/21/david-trone-congress-racial-insult/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67c20000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67c20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">using a similar-sounding and dated slur</a> used to demean Black people. He apologized and said he misspoke. Alsobrooks’ allies argue that all-but-disqualified Trone from the race.</p><p>Trone later inflamed racial tensions when he questioned Alsobrooks’ qualifications for Senate in an attack ad featuring Black officials from Alsobrooks’ Prince George’s County. One suggested she was not ready to make a jump to a statewide federal position.</p><p>A letter, signed mostly by Black women, said the characterization was “not only disparaging and dismissive but also echoes tones of misogyny and racism.” While Trone scrubbed the “training wheels” comment from the ad, he later repeated the phrase in a television interview and said he had the endorsement of top officials from the county while “The people in Prince George’s County who stuck with her are the low-level folks.”</p><p>Both campaigns spent the campaign’s final weekend shoring up voters in what’s become a crucial battleground county.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">The Hogan factor: Democrats are facing a formidable opponent</h2><p>Hogan has not had much to do during the primary other than, well, be himself. He left office in early 2023 and enjoyed sky-high approval ratings, in part due to his fervent anti-Donald Trump stance.</p><p>Hogan eschewed overtures from the No Labels presidential project in favor of running for Senate in Maryland, recruited by national Republicans as a means of putting Democrats on defense. His entry in the race on the <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/02/09/congress/hogan-running-for-senate-00140681" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;final day of the candidate filing deadline&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/02/09/congress/hogan-running-for-senate-00140681&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67c20002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67c20003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">final day of the candidate filing deadline</a> upended what had been a relatively sleepy Democratic primary and scrambled the Senate map as Democrats try to defend a razor-thin majority. It could force national Democrats to siphon money away from other critical Senate seats races, including Ohio, Montana and Nevada, to defend a normally safe Maryland seat against a well-liked opponent with near universal name ID in the state.</p><p>Maryland Democrats have tried to cast Hogan as someone who is out of step with voters in the state and a tool for MAGA Republicans attempting to curb women’s reproductive rights.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/c8/41/c3cceb38446ba52b36d7194373b3/the-ap-interview-gov-larry-hogan-72095.jpg" /><br /><p>Abortion may be Hogan's biggest hurdle to winning the Senate seat. The issue has been a major driver of Democratic victories since the Supreme Court overturned <i>Roe v. Wade </i>in 2022, and it is on the ballot in the fall as Marylanders vote on whether to enshrine abortion into Maryland’s Constitution. Hogan is on record saying he would not support a national abortion ban, but it will be a challenge for him to overcome voters’ long-established understanding of the GOP as the party opposing abortion and Democrats as the ones supporting it.</p><p>Hogan undoubtedly looms large in the general election and represents Republicans’ best chance to flip the seat. He currently leads both Alsobrooks and Trone in public surveys by double digits according to an April survey by <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2024/04/16/poll-trone-alsobrooks-senate-hogan/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the Baltimore Sun&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.baltimoresun.com/2024/04/16/poll-trone-alsobrooks-senate-hogan/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67c20004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67c20005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the Baltimore Sun</a>.</p><p>Should he advance to the general election, however, it would be the first time Hogan appears on the same ballot as former president. Biden walloped Trump in Maryland by 33 percentage points four years ago. With Trump being so unpopular in the state, any built in advantage Hogan still has among voters, may be in jeopardy for him come November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kennedy Jr. campaign is beating ballot access expectations.</p><p>The campaign turned in more than twice the signatures needed to qualify for the ballot in Texas, which requires more than 100,000 signatures from registered voters.</p><p>Kennedy and his rookie campaign team’s ability to reach the requirement is an organizational feat — one they’re repeating in state after state.</p><p>“The pundits, who at the beginning of this campaign, were saying it would be impossible for us to get on the ballot, and we got on the ballot in Texas,” Kennedy said at a rally in Austin, Texas, after delivering the petitions to the Secretary of State’s office. “And if we can get on in Texas, we can get on everywhere.”</p><p>Kennedy and his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, are now on the ballot in four states. They have finished signature gathering in nine more and are circulating petitions for 29 others.</p><p>The campaign hopes to defy the odds and get on the ballot in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., — ensuring that his candidacy will affect the November election.</p><p>“In the last two or three months, I’ve been very impressed with the Kennedy operation for being able to smartly maneuver and get on ballots that were expensive and difficult,” said Michael Arno, whose ballot access firm worked with No Labels. ”It sounds like they’ve done very well in both Texas and New York, and that’s very impressive and a real feather in their cap.”<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352184067112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Getting ballot access as an independent candidate after quitting the Democratic Party primary in October seemed unlikely for Kennedy. Typically independent candidates must plan for months or even years before launching a third-party candidacy.</p><p>Unlike the Libertarian and Green parties, which have established grassroots support, local chapters and, in some cases, existing ballot access, Kennedy’s campaign started from scratch in October.</p><p>Communications director Del Bigtree said in an interview at the Austin rally, which drew about 400 people, that ballot access is not not even a major issue for the campaign.</p><p>The campaign has succeeded in gathering signatures in states with strenuous requirements like Texas and New York while also pursuing other avenues to ballot access. In California, which would have required 75,000 signatures, and Michigan, Kennedy enlisted the help of existing third parties that already have a spot on the November ballot. In Iowa, his campaign hosted a one-day convention to nominate him with the backing of 500 registered voters from across the state.</p><p>The combination of efforts has helped the campaign gain momentum, with limited resources.</p><p>“In a nutshell, he’s succeeding,” said Richard Winger, a ballot access expert who runs the website Ballot Access News and with whom the campaign has shared their internal signature gathering stats.</p><p>Still, the campaign has made missteps.</p><p>Kennedy will have to re-collect more than 10,000 signatures in Nevada because his campaign began circulating its petitions before it named the ticket’s vice presidential candidate.

It has already spent close to $2.5 million on its effort.</p><p>The Kennedy campaign is now re-collecting signatures in places where American Values 2024 had already finished canvassing — Georgia, Arizona and South Carolina. Press Secretary Stefanie Spear said the campaign is “100 percent separate from the PAC.”</p><p>“They’ve been somewhat inefficient, but that’s not surprising because they’re all doing this for the first time,” Winger said. “But they’re competent.”</p><p>Kennedy has relied on a combination of volunteers and paid signature-gatherers. The campaign has spent $390,000 on professional signature gathering from Trent Pool’s firm Accelerate 2020 as well as about $34,000 on other ballot access consulting, according to the campaign’s financial disclosures to the FEC.</p><p>“I don’t think he ever thought he could get on [ballots] with all volunteers, and he didn’t. He never could have done this in Texas without paid petitioners. The same way in New York,” Winger said. “But a lot of the easier states are still all volunteers.”</p><p>Even with the early successes, nothing is final until state officials review the campaign’s signatures to certify the Kennedy ticket's addition to the November ballot, and legal challenges from outside groups could still arise. But the Kennedy campaign had already won numerous legal challenges on ballot access this year, including a challenge against <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/20/kennedy-ballot-hawaii-00153491" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Kennedy’s formation of a new third party in Hawaii&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/20/kennedy-ballot-hawaii-00153491&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67c80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67c80001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Kennedy’s formation of a new third party in Hawaii</a>.</p><p>“I think it was a huge hurdle,” Bigtree said. “It’s downhill from here.

Bob Menendez looked on Monday as scores of prospective jurors entered a federal courtroom in Manhattan to select a dozen New Yorkers who will have more say over the Democrat’s legacy in the next two months than millions of New Jersey voters have had over the past five decades.</p><p>But unlike the trial of Donald Trump, happening just down the street, few of the people in the courtroom seem to have strong feelings about the man himself.</p><p>During the opening days of the Trump trial, dozens of prospective jurors were dismissed after they told a state court judge that they could not be impartial. About a third of the 150 prospective jurors in Menendez’s trial are expected to be dismissed after the first day — but the jury pool seemed more concerned about the toll a seven-week trial may take on their vacation plans, jobs and family responsibilities.</p><p>Jury selection will continue Tuesday.</p><p>A few would-be jurors — like a few self-described news and political junkies, an NYU film instructor, a local government official who handles contracts and a housing attorney — said they’d read enough about the case and didn’t feel they could be partial.</p><p>“I get very worked up,” the housing attorney said, during a meeting with Judge Sidney Stein about whether she could serve on the jury. She said the allegations in the case were “triggering.”</p><p>The NYU instructor said he knew Menendez had been tried once before and so it was “hard to see him sitting back in court again with taxpayer dollars having gone through this once and being back.”</p><p>But those kinds of would-be jurors were few and far between.</p><p>Part of that has to do with Trump’s omnipresent polarization of the American political scene, while Menendez, for all his power in New Jersey and in Washington, is not a household name like even other senators who frequent the Sunday show circuit.</p><p>Another part is a simple function of the Hudson River that divides much of New York and New Jersey’s political lives from each other, even if they share a media market.</p><p>The corruption trial is Menendez’s second in a decade. In 2017, he walked out of a New Jersey federal courthouse after a mistrial in a separate case when jurors deadlocked.</p><p>That followed careful attention to the jury by Menendez’s defense team in that case. At the time, Menendez said he’d not taken in the stand, in part, because they’d calculated that any more time would increase the chances of losing a juror who was going to be excused for vacation. Menendez said the defense thought “she believed in our innocence” based on her reactions to both sides’ presentations.</p><p>Earlier this year, his attorneys tried to get the current case moved to New Jersey, arguing the “overwhelming bulk” of the actions described in the indictment by federal prosecutors happened in New Jersey. “Surely,” his attorneys wrote, “it has nothing to do” with the previous case where a “New Jersey jury” “saw through the government’s false narrative.”</p><p>So perhaps it’s no wonder that his attorneys and attorneys for his two co-codefendants — a pair of New Jersey businesspeople accused of bribing Menendez — were looking for any hint of sympathy in prospective jurors, like one juror who asked to be excused because she was traveling to Spain to attend a concert by New Jersey native son Bruce Springsteen.</p><p>“You should want her,” Stein, the judge, told an attorney for one of the businesspeople.</p><p>“I do,” the attorney replied.</p><p>As he left the courthouse Monday evening, Menendez, dressed in a dark suit, said, “I appreciate the jury’s sacrifice, their time and commitment.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

And she went right to an audience of the MAGA faithful to do it.</p><p>In a bid to get back on track from the book backlash, the South Dakota governor on Monday spoke before Club 47, a Donald Trump fan club, aiming to make the case for herself as a “good investment” and someone who would do “everything I can” to help Trump get reelected.</p><p>“I’ve won 12 campaigns now,” she said. “So, I don’t know how to lose. I just win. That’s all we do.”</p><p>Noem faced several tense interviews and outcry from both sides of the aisle in recent weeks after an excerpt from her “No Going Back” book leaked in which she admitted to killing her unruly 14-month-old dog, Cricket, in a gravel pit 20 years ago. She has consistently defended her choice in interviews, but <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/kristi-noem-book-dog-kim-jong-un-1235909103/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;in the past week&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/05/kristi-noem-book-dog-kim-jong-un-1235909103/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67d20000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67d20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">in the past week</a> pulled back on some appearances.</p><p>But on Monday night, nearly every seat in the ballroom was filled with Trump fans at a Hilton about 2.5 miles from Mar-a-Lago. The audience laughed at her jokes, clapped at her bravado and often murmured in agreement. Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was in the audience. At least one attendee even brought her dog and sat in the third row.</p><p>“This book is a little unfiltered,” Noem said before attendees who’d received a signed copy of the political memoir with entry tickets. “I hope you’re ready for it.”</p><p>During her speech, Noem bragged about keeping her state open during the Covid pandemic, signing restrictions on transgender women’s participation in sports and sending the national guard to the U.S.-Mexico border. She repeatedly praised Trump and highlighted the bond she said the two shared, recounting at one point how they rail against the media together “all the time.”</p><p>She also tucked in a thinly veiled dig at other prospective candidates rumored to be in consideration as Trump’s running mate, specifically criticizing those who’d mounted a run against him and thought they’d “do a better job.”</p><p>“Now they're back on your team, aren't they — begging for help?” she said she told Trump. “‘Oh, Mr. President, we think you're so fantastic,’" she continued, impersonating other politicians. “Why would you run against him then? He obviously was the right plan from the beginning.”</p><p>Noem is already considered an unlikely contender to be Trump’s running mate, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/02/kristi-noem-dog-trump-2024-00155856" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;POLITICO previously reported&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/02/kristi-noem-dog-trump-2024-00155856&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67d20002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67d20003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">POLITICO previously reported</a>, though she did appear at a Republican National Committee fundraiser in Palm Beach earlier this month alongside other GOP politicians considered to be on Trump’s short list, such as Sens. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151820" data-person-id="151820" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715656420197,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d9-d0a8-a59b-ffd93d630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715656420197,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d9-d0a8-a59b-ffd93d630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;151820\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151820\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Sen.

Most had already fled fighting elsewhere during the seven-month war between Israel and Hamas.</p><p>Israel has portrayed Rafah as the last stronghold of the militant group, brushing off warnings from the United States and other allies that any major operation there would be catastrophic for civilians. Hamas has meanwhile regrouped and is battling Israeli forces in parts of Gaza that Israel bombarded and invaded earlier in the war.</p><p>U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Monday that another 100,000 Palestinians have been displaced in northern Gaza following recent Israeli evacuation orders there. That would mean that around a fifth of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people have been displaced over the past week.</p><p>Thirty-eight trucks of flour arrived through the western Erez Crossing, a second access point to northern Gaza, said Abeer Etefa, a spokeswoman for the U.N.’s World Food Program. Israel announced the crossing’s opening Sunday.</p><p>But no food has entered the two main crossings in southern Gaza for the past week.</p><p>The Rafah crossing into Egypt has been closed since Israeli troops seized it a week ago. Fighting in Rafah city has made it impossible for aid groups to access the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel, though Israel says it is allowing supply trucks to enter from its side.</p><p>For the past week, the Israeli military has intensified bombardment and other operations in Rafah while ordering the population to evacuate from parts of the city. Israel insists it is a limited operation focused on rooting out tunnels and other militant infrastructure along the border with Egypt.</p><p>Israeli forces were also battling Palestinian militants in Zeitoun and the urban Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, areas where the army had launched major operations earlier in the war.</p><p>Etefa said WFP was distributing food from its remaining stocks in the areas of Khan Younis in the south and Deir al-Balah farther north, where many of those escaping Rafah have fled.</p><p>Inside Rafah, only two organizations partnering with WFP were still able to distribute food, and no bakeries were operating.</p><p>“The majority of distributions have stopped due to the evacuation orders, displacement and running out of food,” she said.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352678748112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Israeli protesters halted a convoy of aid bound for Gaza at a checkpoint between the occupied West Bank and Israel. Videos circulating online showed them hurling some of the aid off trucks and destroying it. Police said a number of arrests were made, without elaborating.</p><p>Almost the entire population of Gaza relies on humanitarian aid to survive. Israeli restrictions and ongoing fighting have hindered humanitarian efforts, causing widespread hunger and a “full-blown famine” in the north, according to the U.N.</p><p>The director of the Kuwait Hospital, one of the last functioning medical centers in Rafah, said medical staff and residents living near the facility have been told to evacuate. Sohaib al-Hams warned that any evacuation of the hospital itself would have “catastrophic consequences.”</p><p>The international charity Oxfam, meanwhile, warned of disease outbreaks in Gaza following an estimated $210 million worth of damage to water and sanitation infrastructure, mass displacement and the onset of summer.</p><p>“Oxfam staff in Gaza have described piles of human waste and rivers of sewage in the streets, which people are having to jump between. They also reported people having to drink dirty water and children being bitten by insects swarming around the sewage,” it said in a statement.</p><p>The war began when Hamas and other militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking another 250 hostage. Militants still hold about 100 captives and the remains of more than 30 after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year.</p><p>Israel’s offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures. Israel says it has killed over 13,000 militants, without providing evidence.</p><p>Israel marked an especially somber Memorial Day on Monday, with ceremonies commemorating fallen soldiers, including the more than 600 killed since Oct. 7, more than half of them in the initial attack. Sirens announced two minutes of silence at 11 a.m.</p><p>At a ceremony at Mount Herzl cemetery on the outskirts of Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed once again to defeat Hamas.</p><p>“We exacted and will exact a high price from the enemy for their criminal acts. We will realize the goals of victory and at the center of them the return of all our hostages,” he said.</p><p>Protesters and hecklers interrupted some of the ceremonies, reflecting growing discontent with Israel’s leaders that has brought thousands of protesters into the streets in recent months. Critics blame Netanyahu for the security and intelligence failures that allowed the attack to happen and for the failure to reach a deal with Hamas to release the hostages.</p><p>Months of internationally mediated talks over a cease-fire and hostage release ground to an apparent standstill last week after Israel launched its incursion into Rafah. Israel has refused Hamas’ central demands for an end to the war and the withdrawal of its forces from the territory, saying that doing so would allow the militant group to regain control and launch more Oct. 7-style attacks.</p><p>U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration, which has provided crucial military and diplomatic support for the overall offensive, has expressed growing impatience with Israel, saying it won’t supply offensive arms for a full-scale Rafah assault.</p><p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Sunday that Israel could face an “enduring insurgency” if it doesn’t come up with a realistic plan for postwar governance in Gaza. Israel has rejected U.S. proposals for the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza with help from Arab states because those plans depend on progress toward the establishment of a Palestinian state, which Netanyahu opposes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The longest trusses toppled away from the grounded Dali container ship and slid off its bow, sending a wall of water splashing back toward the ship.</p><p>It marked a major step in freeing the ship, which has been stuck amid the wreckage since it lost power and crashed into one of the bridge’s support columns shortly after leaving Baltimore on March 26. The demolished span came crashing down on the ship’s bow and remained resting on its deck for the past six weeks.</p><p>The collapse killed six construction workers and halted most maritime traffic through Baltimore’s busy port. The controlled demolition will allow the Dali to be refloated and restore traffic through the port, which will provide relief for thousands of longshoremen, truckers and small business owners who have seen their jobs impacted by the closure.</p><p>Officials said the detonation went as planned. They said the next step in the dynamic cleanup process is to assess the few remaining trusses on the Dali’s bow and make sure none of the underwater wreckage is preventing the ship from being refloated and moved.</p><p>“It’s a lot like peeling back an onion,” said Lt. Gen. Scott Spellmon of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.</p><p>Officials still expect to refloat the ship within the next few days.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6349748027112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>“This was a very big milestone for our progression forward,” said Col. Estee Pinchasin, Baltimore District Commander for the Army Corps of Engineers. She said crews don’t anticipate having to use any more explosives.</p><p>The Dali’s 21-member crew remained onboard the ship during the detonation, and no injuries or problems were reported, said Capt. David O’Connell, commander of the Port of Baltimore.</p><p>The crew members haven’t been allowed to leave the grounded vessel since the disaster. Officials said they’ve been busy maintaining the ship and assisting investigators. Of the crew members, 20 are from India and one is Sri Lankan.</p><p>In a videographic released this week, authorities said engineers were using precision cuts to control how the trusses break down. They said the method allows for “surgical precision” and is one of the safest and most efficient ways to remove steel under a high level of tension.</p><p>The National Transportation Safety Board and the FBI are conducting investigations into the bridge collapse.</p><p>Danish shipping giant Maersk had chartered the Dali for a planned trip from Baltimore to Sri Lanka, but the ship didn’t get far. Its crew sent a mayday call saying they had lost power and had no control of the steering system. Minutes later, the ship rammed into the bridge.</p><p>Officials have said the safety board investigation will focus on the ship’s electrical system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ron DeSantis on Monday knocked down speculation that his wife, first lady Casey DeSantis, would run to succeed him in 2026.</p><p>The Republican governor insisted at an event in event in Coral Gables that Casey DeSantis, a former television anchor who was a near constant presence on the campaign trail when he ran for president, had “zero” interest in running for governor.</p><p>There has been a constant speculation and buzz surrounding the potential political future of Casey DeSantis since her husband will leave office in early 2027 due to term limits. One public poll released last November had Casey DeSantis ahead of other potential Republicans by double-digits although a large percentage of those surveyed didn’t have an answer.</p><p><a href="https://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/april2024flapoll.php" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;A poll released last month by Florida Atlantic University&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/april2024flapoll.php&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67ea0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67ea0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">A poll released last month by Florida Atlantic University</a> found that Casey DeSantis was significantly favored by GOP voters in a hypothetical Republican matchup against Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/189765" data-person-id="189765" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715640217886,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d9-d0a8-a59b-ffd93d630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715640217886,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d9-d0a8-a59b-ffd93d630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;189765\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/189765\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Rep.

But, you know, I think it’s because she has had a front row seat on all the nonsense that goes on when you do it.”</p><p>DeSantis did acknowledge that some people had suggested that Casey DeSantis — a cancer survivor who has championed various initiatives, including one that helps people transition from government assistance — consider running. But he said that was due to the success of the programs she has supported during the five years she has been first lady. The governor and first lady also have three young children ranging in ages 7 to 3.</p><p>The governor’s comments echo the sentiments that several people who know the couple have expressed in recent months, even as speculation about a political future for Casey DeSantis has mounted. Casey DeSantis has been a key partner in her husband’s rise as a conservative star over the last several years. She has always been viewed as one of the most important advisers in his inner circle.</p><p>Yet those who know the governor have said privately that Casey DeSantis is not interested in entering politics on her own.</p><p>DeSantis last year launched a race for president, but he ended his campaign shortly after he finished way behind former President Donald Trump in the Iowa caucuses. DeSantis endorsed Trump after the bruising primary that saw Trump and his team constantly belittle DeSantis. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/02/desantis-trump-republican-candidate-fundraising-00155590" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;DeSantis recently met with Trump and has agreed to raise money to help his campaign&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/02/desantis-trump-republican-candidate-fundraising-00155590&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67eb0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67eb0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">DeSantis recently met with Trump and has agreed to raise money to help his campaign</a>.

Phil Murphy, whose limited public comments on the bill have been noncommittal. The governor's signature would mean the first major changes to New Jersey's Open Public Records Act in two decades, and critics say it would "gut" access to government records. </p><p>Critics of the legislation in the audience chanted “shame” as the Senate, back from taking a brief pause during an otherwise-uneventful voting session, quickly passed the bill with no debate. Some people in the audience jeered during the debate in the Assembly. The bill, <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/NJ_24R_S_2930" data-bill-id="NJ_24R_S_2930" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715633108204,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000186-5091-de35-afde-71f30dcb0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715633108204,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000186-5091-de35-afde-71f30dcb0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;bill&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;NJ_24R_S_2930\&quot;,\&quot;displayNumber\&quot;:\&quot;NJ S2930 (24R)\&quot;,\&quot;displayTitle\&quot;:\&quot;Makes various changes to process for access to government records; appropriates $10 million.*\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill\&quot;}&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;NJ S2930 (24R)&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/NJ_24R_S_2930&quot;,&quot;billId&quot;:&quot;NJ_24R_S_2930&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-73b3-d3a0-a5df-73b391c60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;a60d73b2-5514-37d7-aef6-745d4c6e16c9&quot;}">NJ S2930 (24R)</a>, passed the Senate 21-10 — the minimum number of votes needed for passage — and the Assembly 44-25 with one abstention. </p><p>“We have talked to advocates, we have heard criticisms. There have been many, many amendments made to try to satisfy those,” Senate President Nick Scutari told reporters after the vote. “But some people will never be satisfied regardless of how you're going to reach out to them.”</p><p>Before the vote, the cameras that normally broadcast the Senate’s proceedings did not turn back on in time after the Senate’s pause to catch the vote, leaving the public outside of the Senate chambers with no way to observe the vote. </p><p>The Assembly was a different story, with lawmakers holding a heated debate on the floor. The bill’s top sponsor in that house, Joe Danielsen, railed against “abusers” he said sought to catch records custodians with technical errors to be able to sue them and then offer to settle for cash.</p><p>“This is a good bill that continues to protect transparency, continues to protect citizens rights and continues to protect the taxpayers' resources and money,” said Danielsen, a Democrat.</p><p>One of his former colleagues in the Legislature strongly disagreed. </p><p>"Today, the Democratic-led State Legislature, a body I served for more than two decades, collaborated with Republicans to fundamentally gut our Open Public Records Act," former Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg, who tried to broaden access to public records, said in a statement. </p><p>"Leadership reached across the aisle to pass this anti-democratic bill because they didn't have enough democratic votes in their caucus," she added. "Secrecy and evading accountability, I guess, has turned bipartisan. I could not be more disappointed in the New Jersey State Legislature." </p><p>Supporters of the measure, mainly county and municipal government lobbying organizations, argue the 22-year-old statute needs to be modernized to catch up with technological advancements and deal with records requests from businesses. “This is about saving taxpayer dollars. This is about modernizing something that occurred over 20 years ago,” Scutari said.</p><p>But the amendments to OPRA remove a major incentive for local governments to comply with records requests: Mandatory fee shifting, in which those governments have to cover the “reasonable” legal costs of anyone who successfully challenges a records request they denied. Under the new bill, judges would have the discretion over whether to award plaintiffs legal fees in records requests cases, unless they determine the denial was made in “bad faith,” “unreasonably” or the government agency “knowingly or willfully” violated the law.</p><p>Advocates say that beyond just removing a mandatory penalty against governments that refuse legitimate requests, the change would make it much harder for a lawyer to take on precedential cases in which it’s not yet clear whether the record being sought should be publicly available. This, along with other changes to the bill, would “gut” access to public records, they argue.</p><p>“My office has received hundreds of emails and phone calls from constituents, 100 percent opposed to the legislation, to the point that the staff couldn’t handle the volume of calls and let them go to voicemail,” said state Sen. Andrew Zwicker, a Democrat who voted against the bill.</p><p>The vote on the bill did not break down cleanly along party lines, though there was more opposition from Republicans than Democrats.</p><p>Assemblymember Brian Bergen, a Republican, asked Danielsen if he’d take some questions on the floor. Danielsen refused. Bergen alleged that members who voted yes on the bill did so because they were scared of retribution or in exchange for advancing their own legislation.</p><p>“Every yes vote that you’re going to get today is either threatened to be that way or bought to be that way, and it’s disgusting, Mr. Speaker,” Bergen said, later adding that “If you vote for this bill today… you are the exact person that people don’t trust.”</p><p>The bill would appropriate $10 million, part of which would go to government agencies for technological upgrades to post more information online.</p><p>Backers of the bill initially framed it as a way to cut down on commercial requests. But an earlier portion of the bill that would bar data brokers from requesting government documents was entirely removed in the latest version.</p><p>Other controversial changes to the law include:</p><p>— Shifting the burden to justify charging special fees on OPRA requests that are allegedly time-consuming to vet and fill from governments agencies to the requesters themselves.</p><p>— Allowing government agencies to get protective orders from courts to limit the amount of requests a person can make if they show there’s an an “intent to substantially impair” government operations.</p><p>— Requiring requesters to be more specific when searching for emails and other communications from government officials.</p><p>— Expanding the initial deadline to respond to commercial OPRA requests from 7 to 14 days, though it would allow commercial requesters to pay extra fees to have their requests expedited to 7 days. (In practice, the current seven-day deadline for all requesters is often extended, sometimes by months).</p><p>— Barring access to files’ metadata, except the part “that identifies authorship, identity of editor, and time of change.”</p><p> — Barring those who have received photos or video footage through a public records request from disseminating "any indecent or graphic images of the subject’s intimate part” without their consent.

We will aggressively investigate and prosecute those who threaten election workers.”</p><p>Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, who is overseeing the Justice Department’s response to AI, said emerging technologies are increasingly involved in efforts to intimidate pollworkers and others who manage elections.</p><p>“A particularly disturbing trend across these cases is the way perpetrators use new technologies to mask their identities and communicate their threats,” Monaco said. “Today, criminals use a range of anonymizing technologies, not just burner phones and social media.”</p><p>Monaco called “artificial intelligence” the “most disruptive” of the new tools being used to disrupt elections.</p><p>“These advanced tools are providing new avenues for bad actors to hide their identities and obscure sources of threats,” she said. “They're providing new avenues to misinform and threaten voters through deep fakes, spreading altered video or cloned audio impersonating trusted voices, and providing new avenues to recruit and radicalize with incendiary social media content that accelerates online hate and harassment.”</p><p>“Where threat actors use advanced technology, like artificial intelligence, to make their crimes more dangerous and more impactful, the Department of Justice will seek enhanced sentences,” said Monaco.</p><p>The law enforcement officials who gathered at Garland’s office Monday for the meeting of the Election Threats Task Force made no public mention of the candidates expected to be at the top of the ballot in November — President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump — or how their rematch could stir up emotions particularly among Americans who falsely believe the 2020 election was stolen.</p><p>The formal comments by department officials included no reference to the fact that in recent weeks Trump has declined to say that he will respect the 2024 election results and has said he’s unsure if the coming election will lead to violence.</p><p>“If we don’t win, you know, it depends,” Trump <a href="https://time.com/6972021/donald-trump-2024-election-interview/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;told Time Magazine last month&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://time.com/6972021/donald-trump-2024-election-interview/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67f90002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67f90003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">told Time Magazine last month</a>. “It always depends on the fairness of the election.”</p><p>While FBI Director Christopher Wray also avoided specifics Monday, he did observe that some recent threats to those involved in the electoral process have taken place “even after elections.”</p><p>“Any threat of violence into an election official, volunteer or staff, is completely unacceptable, and something the FBI takes very seriously,” Wray said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

U.S. officials have previously warned that <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/05/06/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-and-national-security-communications-advisor-john-kirby-3/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Israel can’t defeat Hamas’ ideology&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/05/06/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-and-national-security-communications-advisor-john-kirby-3/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67fc0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67fc0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Israel can’t defeat Hamas’ ideology</a>.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352615487112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Israel has pledged to continue its military operation in Gaza until Hamas is defeated, in what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/07/netanyahu-hamas-cease-fire-demands-00140182" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;has described as “absolute victory.”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/07/netanyahu-hamas-cease-fire-demands-00140182&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67fd0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d67fd0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">has described as “absolute victory.”</a></p><p>Many countries want to see a “political solution in which the rights of Palestinians are more respected,” Campbell added. “I don’t think it’s ever been more difficult than right now, but I still believe that the commitment is there.”</p><p>Separately, national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed to reporters Monday that while the U.S. will continue to offer its advice to Israel, it is a sovereign country that will make its own decisions.</p><p>“Their leadership is choosing how to prosecute this war. They’re going to make those decisions,” Sullivan said. “With the question of a strategic endgame, I don’t think that’s really a question about American influence. That’s a question about Israel's strategy and what Israel chooses to do.”</p><p>Those remarks come as Israel continues its devastating military operation across the Gaza Strip. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have fled the southern city of Rafah as Israeli troops conducted targeted operations over the past weeks to root out militants hiding there.</p><p>Israel’s military operation has also dealt a blow to the country’s reputation on the world stage.

The motto of Eurovision is “United By Music” but the vibe here in Malmo felt more fractious than ever.</p><p>On Saturday, the day of the competition’s finale, Ireland’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/eurovision-ireland-palestine-makeup.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Bambie Thug, a neo-pagan act whose song caterwauls between a Marilyn Manson-esque nightmare and Betty Boop&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.vulture.com/article/eurovision-ireland-palestine-makeup.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68050000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68050001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Bambie Thug, a neo-pagan act whose song caterwauls between a Marilyn Manson-esque nightmare and Betty Boop</a>, pulled out of a performance in front of a ticket-buying public of 10,000, over tensions with the Israeli public broadcaster. At that same performance, France’s contestant interrupted his song to call for an end to the war, “We need to be united by music, yes, but with love for peace.” In the hours following, both last year’s runner-up, Finland’s Kaarija, and fourth-placing candidate, Norway’s Alessandra, pulled out of the broadcast, which then opened with boos echoing through the arena as Eden Golan, Israel’s representative, stepped on stage. If large segments of the millions of fans and many of the competitors had had their way, Golan wouldn’t have been allowed on stage at all. The atmosphere behind the scenes was so tense that it spilled over into non-Israel related conflicts. The Dutch artist, Joost, was disqualified for an altercation that took place the day before the contest.</p><p>It wasn’t supposed to be this way.</p><p>The 2024 Eurovision was hosted in Sweden, on the 50th Anniversary of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XJBNJ2wq0Y" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;ABBA winning the contest&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XJBNJ2wq0Y&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68050002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68050003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">ABBA winning the contest</a>. The elaborate stage production was a technical masterpiece, with 37 countries participating for an audience of nearly 200 million people — larger than the Super Bowl, Grammys and Oscars combined. But this year’s contest was also occurring against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, in which an estimated 34,000 Palestinians have died, setting the stage for the most contentious Eurovision in the modern era. The week-long celebration of “unity” featured protests against Israeli participation that outnumbered the people inside the arena, a Koran burning and Swedish police reporting credible hacking threats from Iran, North Korea and Russia. ABBA never made an appearance.</p><p>This year was truly Eurovision’s Waterloo.</p><p>While Russia’s bloody conflict in Ukraine permeated every aspect of the contest these past two years, Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza is different. Russia’s actions united the Eurovision coalition in response, while Israel’s have left the EBU’s member countries bitterly divided. The furious debates over the war pose an existential threat to a contest that has always put its faith in the power of music to bring people together. As Stig Karlsen, the head of Norway’s Eurovision delegation told me, “They need to look at the rules… for a lot of people, it’s becoming ‘divided by music.’"<br /></p><br /><p><br /><b>The tension in Eurovision’s identity between</b> a light-hearted music competition and a political event has always existed. Founded in 1956, the song contest was born into a fractured Europe still stitching itself back together after World War II. That first year, Walter Andreas Schwarz, whose father had been killed by the Nazis, represented Germany with a song about how his country was not properly dealing with the legacy of the Holocaust. The years following featured Italy censoring its own act out of fear that the pro-divorce song would sway a controversial referendum and Francisco Franco using the contest to advertise his dictatorship in Spain. With the integration of Eastern European countries after the fall of the Iron Curtain, the political moments continued. One contestant dodged sniper fire to escape from Sarajevo under lockdown, all to sing about the suffering of his people on the Eurovision stage.</p><p>But as the fundamental disagreements in Europe subsided, Eurovision entered its own “end of history,” commonly referred to as the “Sweden Era” in the early aughts when Eurovision changed from a stodgy cultural program to a big splashy arena show in the style of “American Idol.” Anyone watching the broadcast Saturday night saw the legacy of the Sweden era in the flashy LEDs and pyrotechnics. But it now exists alongside a growing sense of a Europe politically divided.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/c0/5c/4dd56a8344f885317c0158fcf89c/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2151981473" /><br /><p>In the 2010s, concurrent with the rise of right-wing authoritarianism on the continent, Turkey and Hungary withdrew, saying the contest had become LGBT propaganda. Belarus left the contest after its two pro-Alexander Lukashenko, anti-protest anthems were rejected. And Russia was kicked out after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. As the Deputy Director General of the European Broadcasting Union Jean Philip de Tender put it when I sat down with him, “What’s happened over the last 10-15 years is we’ve become more values driven.”</p><p>It was after the invasion of Russia that modern Eurovision seemed to have come into its own. The 2023 contest in Liverpool engaged directly with the war, as acts expressed solidarity with the Ukrainian people, including an openly anti-Putin, anti-war number from the Croatian avant-punk band, Let 3. But though Eurovision seemed to have found its voice, as many Eurovision singers know, even the most confident voice sometimes cracks.<br /></p><br /><p><br /><b>The tension in this year’s Eurovision</b> was embodied by a performer in the very first semi-final. Eric Saade represented Sweden in the contest in 2011 with a song that could be an anthem for Eurovision’s desire for global chart success. The song’s hook repeatedly intones “I will be popular” over the kind of bubblegum track that has led to Swedish dominance of pop music worldwide, so it made sense that Saade would open the week celebrating Eurovision’s rising prominence by performing his iconic song.</p><p>But Saade is also of Palestinian heritage, and so performed his gleefully apolitical anthem with a black and white checked keffiyeh his father gave to him wrapped around his wrist. The European Broadcasting Union, which organizes the contest, instantly criticized him for politicizing the competition. Saade hit back by pointing out that, as a cultural symbol, it should be treated no differently from the kind of traditional folk garb normally celebrated by the contest (including 2022 Ukrainian winners Kalush Orchestra’s ‘Hutsul keptar’ vests). Unless, of course, the EBU views Palestinian identity as inherently political.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/97/86/8dd040a3428b9677a002dda75389/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2151397610" /><br /><p>The lack of consistent principles from the organizers opens the competition up to charges of hypocrisy. The show has a flag policy, for instance, that deems all flags that aren’t the national flag of a participating country as political. Except for the LGBT pride flag. To say that a Palestinian flag is political, but a gay pride flag is not seems ridiculous on its face, but de Tender disagrees. “We have been embraced by the LGBTQI+ community. They have built this event,” he told me. “For me and for the EBU, the rainbow flag is not a political flag.”</p><p>On one level, he’s right: The contest has an admirable history of support for queer rights. But the core of his argument is essentially that the gay pride flag isn’t political because Eurovision has a heavily gay audience. In other words, underneath the elaborate rules and distinctions the contest makes between “values” (good) and “politics” (bad), is simple coalition management.</p><p>I spoke with Ireland’s Bambie Thug, who had been told by the EBU that they had to remove their body paint calling for a ceasefire (using a medieval Irish alphabet called Ogham) but were still allowed to hold the trans flag onstage. I asked them how the EBU could better navigate these distinctions. Their reply: “They need some heart … and some humanity.”</p><p>Nemo, the Swiss non-binary artist who would become this year’s winner, seemed to embody the difference in comfort in talking about these two issues. When I asked them about a statement they released in support of a ceasefire, they moved quickly to safer territory, “I would just recommend to go read [my statement]…. I think it's important to use your platform to raise awareness. A lot of what I talk about is, being queer, … and just honestly, being myself at Eurovision in hopes that it inspires other people.”<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/f6/9a/1e7710ec4e1faefb4011029d8eb0/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2151466563" /><br /><p>The attempt to reverse engineer principles out of what will keep the membership happy, is a big part of the story of how we got to the chaos of this year’s contest. The truth of the matter is that in 2022, the European Broadcasting Union didn’t initially want to kick Russia out, releasing a statement reaffirming the contest’s apolitical nature. The EBU reversed course only after an open revolt from their membership.</p><p>This year the EBU decided to keep Israel in, claiming that Eurovision is technically a contest among public broadcasters more than nations (true); they didn’t kick <i>Russia</i> out, they kicked Russia’s <i>public broadcaster</i> out for being a propaganda outlet. Since KAN (the Israeli broadcaster) is independent from the Netanyahu government (and because there wasn’t the same outcry among top officials at other public broadcasters), the reasoning went, there was no reason to kick them out.</p><p>The counter argument is that during the opening flag parade, Eden Golan walked on stage waving the Israeli flag, not that of her country’s public broadcaster. When I pushed him on this, de Tender responded, “When Russia was suspended from the Eurovision Song Contest, there was a broad consensus amongst the membership.” Again, values sit on top of much more practical considerations.</p><p>And so Israel was allowed in Eurovision 2024 with the song “Hurricane,” setting the stage for the most contentious contest in recent history.<br /></p><br /><p><br /><b>Metal detectors were everywhere in</b> the week leading up to the finals. Armed police were stationed on street corners, by train stations and smack in the middle of the dance floor of the event’s nightly official after-party, EuroClub. Karin Karlsson, who headed up organizing Eurovision for the city of Malmo in both 2013 and 2024, explained, “There was a lot of security in 2013 as well, but you couldn't see it. This time [the police] decided they wanted to be seen. Swedes, we are not used to police officers walking around with rifles like that.”</p><p>This is not to say that Eurovision fans weren’t able to have their fun anyway. As an Australian tourist cheerfully remarked to me, “My husband and I play a game where we count the snipers on roofs.”</p><p>The chaos of the situation poured onto the stage as even the acts most strongly associated with carefree Eurovision camp felt the need to comment. Windows95man, a performance artist who achieved viral fame when a picture of him in his signature cut-off jeans and Windows 95 t-shirt was retweeted by John Cena, looked pained when I asked about his decision to participate in Eurovision. “We got thousands of horrible messages and I needed to decide for the whole of Finland," he said. "So I was like totally alone. This was the first time ever I needed to say something political, so it was quite stressful.”</p><p>Some artists never had any hope of avoiding questions about the issue. Bashar Murad, who’s Palestinian, competed to represent Iceland this year at Eurovision, just narrowly losing out in Iceland’s qualifying round. Eurovision runs deep in Murad’s bloodstream: His father was a member of the iconic Palestinian band Sabreen, and both of his parents spearheaded an effort to bring the Palestinian broadcaster into Eurovision. Bashar was headlining FalastinVision, a competition among Palestinian artists that was part protest and part music festival.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/71/9a/572574ec4c059b751ac75f00fc92/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2152510992" /><br /><p>At FalastinVision, it was hard not to think that the discussion over Israel’s participation was missing a key element: Was the problem that an Israeli artist was represented on stage, or that a Palestinian artist wasn’t? Murad put it well: “They're allowed to be humanized on the world stage while we are not.”</p><p>The day before the grand final, things had already reached a breaking point. First the Italian broadcaster accidentally leaked the normally embargoed results of the second semi-final, showing that Israel had garnered the most Italian votes. The winner of Eurovision gets to host the next year so suddenly the organization was facing the prospect that its brand would be further entangled with the most visible humanitarian catastrophe of the day.</p><p>Shortly after, Netherland’s representative, Joost, an artist who performs in what can only be described as <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQLdbuy_e45fLgz66wrxTt-bcSDvRLDTkAqBicJjd1xKA&amp;s" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a Christian Siriano take on a Hillary Clinton pantsuit&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQLdbuy_e45fLgz66wrxTt-bcSDvRLDTkAqBicJjd1xKA&amp;s&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68060001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a Christian Siriano take on a Hillary Clinton pantsuit</a>, had been ejected from the rehearsal after an altercation. Rumors hit the press center with a level of ferocity unusual in the recent history of Eurovision.</p><p>At a press conference the night before, a member of the Israeli delegation told their act that she didn’t have to answer a tough question from a journalist and Joost sharply replied, “Why not?” So some in the press room wrongly thought the altercation emerged out of a clash between the Dutch and Israeli delegations.</p><p>It turned out that Joost had gotten into a fight with a member of the EBU production staff, but the incident was a perfect example of how nearly everything in this year’s contest gets viewed through the lens of Israel. By the next morning, Joost was out of the contest and under investigation by Swedish police. His song, “EuroPapa,” about how internationalism can bring us all closer together, was not heard on stage.</p><p>There’s a way in which the politicization of the contest, and its push toward greater commercialization, so often seen in conflict, are one and the same. Eurovision’s concerted push to go after the coveted youth demographic, as evidenced by the recent addition of TikTok as a major sponsor, has transformed its core audience. The festival swapped out its older demographic for a generation that expects political engagement from its universities, cultural institutions and even brands.</p><p>Even Andreas Magnusson, the host of FalastinVision, conceded, “I don’t envy the position the EBU is in.” His belief is that countries at war shouldn’t be in the contest at all. That sentiment was echoed by Stig Karlsen, when I spoke to him. But that invites a whole other set of questions, especially for a festival whose recent high points have been defined by Ukrainian resistance.</p><p>As I watched the final results come in Saturday, the story shifted from the discord over Israel to Nemo’s victory. The artist’s song, a gleeful mix of genres and styles reflective of their non-binary identity, represents the best of what Eurovision has to offer. I reminded myself of the long history of the contest: the years countries dropped out in protest, the times when either because of expense or politics, it was almost discontinued. Even ABBA’s win in 1974 was followed by discord in Sweden over the cost of hosting the competition. An entire protest festival was organized.</p><p>As much as these times have pushed Eurovision to the brink, they’re also a reminder of the importance of institutions that bring a mass public of varying political opinions together. If Eurovision can find a way to include the voices that were left off stage this year without breaking, it will remain an essential cultural forum for working through the major issues of the day. A tall order to be sure, but one that very few institutions have come as close to achieving. As Eric Saade’s song “Popular” opens, “Don’t say that it’s impossible.”</p><br />]]></content:encoded>

The Confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes of the Flathead Indian Nation challenged the Blackfeet Nation to a competition: whichever tribe could muster the highest voter turnout in the upcoming election would win one single buffalo from the other.</p><p>The wagering tribes were also keeping their eye on an even bigger prize: The race for the U.S. House of Representatives in Montana that year was tight. And Native American voters had the opportunity to make a big difference.</p><p>“1992 will truly be the year that Montana discovers the Indian Vote,” read the resolution, passed unanimously by the Flathead tribal council and printed in the <i>Char-KooSta News</i>.

As an example, they point to the Little Shell Tribe, which lobbied Congress for more than 150 years for federal recognition — crucial for tribal sovereignty and access to federal resources such as health care, education and economic development.

But ask about Native American <i>voters</i>, and he’ll dodge the question.<br /></p><br /><p><i>Every </i>voter is important in his election, he tells me when I run into him on Capitol Hill.</p><p>What about the $1 million his campaign invested in tribal turnout?</p><p>“That’s not my pay grade — I’m focused on policy,” Tester quips with a smile before hurrying into the Senate chamber.</p><p>Over the years, that focus on Native American policy has won Tester the support of Montana tribes, says Cinda Burd-Ironmaker, who leads the <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/03/18/congress/montana-push-for-tribal-votes-tester-senate-00147312" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Tester campaign’s 2024 Native American voting initiative&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/03/18/congress/montana-push-for-tribal-votes-tester-senate-00147312&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d6816000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d6816000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Tester campaign’s 2024 Native American voting initiative</a>.</p><p>“The only true person that has helped Indian Country is Jon Tester,” says Burd-Ironmaker, a member of the Blackfeet tribe.</p><p>“We cannot start over right now.

When I ask if losing Tester from the Senate would make a difference, Boggs is clear: “It won’t.”<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/56/be/5f8024ff4974bf048e6e9b05a848/mag-fertig-lettermontana-nativescount.jpg" /><br /><p>Adds another Blackfeet woman, who was granted anonymity to be honest about her non-voting history, “I watched my grandparents vote. And they've always disagreed with everything that happened, whether they voted or not.”</p><p>Fighting apathy takes an enormous amount of resources. That means finding funding for get out the vote programs and ad campaigns, for community events that help build momentum for Election Day and gas money for transporting voters. In Blackfeet country, DesRosier says, it’s popular to host community feeds, where voting groups or local party organizations set out trays of food, locals show up and candidates can give their stump pitch while everyone eats.</p><p>“Food brings the people on the reservation together better than anything,” DesRosier says. He recounts a time when a politician (probably Tester, but he isn’t sure) donated half a beef — worth approximately $2,000 — for a rally.</p><p>“Where there's been enough money … we've been nearly able to close that Native to white voting gap,” says Bret Healy, a consultant with Four Directions Native Votes, a multi-state nonprofit working on tribal turnout.</p><p>Three voting precincts in Montana’s Blaine County — which is about half Native and half white — illustrate this gap. Four Directions analyzed data on the portion of eligible voters in these two tracts who turned out to vote in the 2022 election. That year, turnout in two majority-Native tracts was 22 percentage points lower than in the majority-white tract. In addition, the decrease in Native turnout between 2020 and 2022 was higher than that of white voters, by five percentage points.<br /></p><br /><p>In other states like North Dakota and Arizona, Four Directions has worked to close the turnout gap between Native and white voters — with some successes. For example, through legal work and voter registration events, Four Directions registered more than 5,000 Native voters in Arizona in 2020 — nearly half of <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/arizona/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the 10,000 votes&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/arizona/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68170002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68170003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the 10,000 votes</a> by which President Joe Biden won this key state. But to accomplish this, organizers have to overcome a lot of hurdles — including a lack of basic infrastructure that other communities take for granted.</p><p>“They don’t have the same internet access,” Healy says. Rural native voting precincts don’t have the same access to news about upcoming elections as rural white precincts, he explains. That poses challenges for everything from politicians campaigning to voters hunting for information about upcoming elections. For the Tester campaign, Burd-Ironmaker says, spotty internet and cellular service means that canvassers hitting up rural reservations can’t communicate with other groups canvassing in other parts of the county.</p><p>Tester’s political apparatus has long targeted Native voters.

And Tester needs Native American votes to win Montana.</p><p>Leaders representing nearly a dozen tribes — including the Crow, Blackfeet and Cheyenne — sit listening over a classic Montana lunch of ribs, pulled pork, beans and potato salad.</p><p>With fervor, Rodgers implores the seated leaders to use the power of their vote in one of the country’s most competitive Senate races to get concessions from some of the nation’s most powerful people. The stakes, Rodgers explains, are too high for Democrats in Washington, D.C. to ignore what Montana’s Native voters want: Continued access to Medicaid and Medicare, assistance in fighting crime and resources to preserve their Native culture and language, among other things.</p><p>“The Native American vote is being courted very aggressively in the state,” Rodgers says later. “The path forward for the Republicans to take control of the Senate again looks like [it] would go through Montana.”</p><p>But Republicans in Washington, D.C. recognize how important Native Americans are to Tester’s chances — and they are not looking to give him any policy wins.

That would mean in-person speeches from the president, party luminaries and rising stars to draw television attention alongside a mix of pre-recorded testimonials and videos from other parts of the country.</p><p>The goal: drive maximum viewership on television and the internet while minimizing live programming and openings for protest in Chicago’s United Center. This would mean moving party business, such as rules and platform votes, off the floor and denying would-be demonstrators a chance to seize on contentious debates.</p><p>While the Biden campaign, White House and convention planners have only just started hatching plans, senior Democrats tell me they’re discussing whether to conduct such business before the convention even begins or move it out of the arena and across town to McCormick Place, their other Chicago venue. Serendipitously, Biden’s advisers may have a very good reason to move up such housekeeping: If the Ohio Legislature does not <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ohio-lawmakers-are-odds-effort-ensure-biden-appears-november-ballot-rcna151369" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715298450156,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018f-0b29-dff0-a7df-1f7ddaa10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715298450156,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018f-0b29-dff0-a7df-1f7ddaa10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ohio-lawmakers-are-odds-effort-ensure-biden-appears-november-ballot-rcna151369&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fc1-d37b-a3ff-7fdb2ca60001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;relax its ballot certification deadline&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fc1-d37b-a3ff-7fdb2ca50002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">relax its ballot certification deadline</a>, which is before the Democrats’ August convention, the DNC may have no choice but to technically nominate the president before the conclave begins.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351415987112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Also under consideration for Chicago: reviving the pre-taped delegation roll call from each state featured in 2020.</p><p>Not only were the clips memorable — who could forget the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-election-2020-oddities-9d8f36096c3b28f0e7f2052f0b190837" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715298475599,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018f-0b29-dff0-a7df-1f7ddaa10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715298475599,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018f-0b29-dff0-a7df-1f7ddaa10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-election-2020-oddities-9d8f36096c3b28f0e7f2052f0b190837&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fc1-d37b-a3ff-7fdb92c80001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Rhode Island chef&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fc1-d37b-a3ff-7fdb92c80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Rhode Island chef</a> standing on a state beach with a plate of calamari — but a video montage also means one less opportunity for hot mic spontaneity, and therefore disruption, from 50 states and territories worth of delegates.</p><p>“If there is one peep in that hall, the networks will be all over it,” a convention planner lamented.</p><p>The challenge, of course, is that the delegates attending and, more to the point, the donors financing the convention expect the rites of an in-person convention. The political convention industrial complex remains strong after centuries of tradition, no matter how much the operative class relished having total control over what was effectively a multi-day commercial four years ago.</p><p>So with campus protests over the war in Gaza raging and Biden being disrupted nearly everywhere he goes, Chicago’s organizers are plotting on how to preempt opportunities for heckling and quickly tamp down demonstrators who do get into the arena.</p><p>William M. Daley, the former Commerce secretary and son and brother of Chicago mayors, has urged top Biden officials to install a capable convention chair who knows how to wield a gavel and can restore order as needed, I’m told. One obvious possibility is Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and another is Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who before entering Congress was speaker of the California Assembly.</p><p>Convention planners are also considering a different chair for each night of the convention, to both share the burden and showcase as much of the party’s talent as possible.</p><p>For all the 1968 clips now being replayed of Chicago police clashing with protesters, it’s the prospect of disorder outside <i>and</i> inside the arena this summer that so alarms Democrats, because either display could hand Republicans fodder.</p><p>“The mayor owns the street but the party owns the inside,” Daley told me. “What happens inside the hall is reflective of our party.”</p><p>As Daley knows well, it wasn’t just the Grant Park images that conveyed chaos to the American voter. It was broadcasters Mike Wallace and Dan Rather being jostled at the convention, the latter of whom prompted Walter Cronkite on <a href="https://danratherjournalist.org/about-dan/controversies/punched-1968-dnc/video-1968-democratic-national-convention" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;live television&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://danratherjournalist.org/about-dan/controversies/punched-1968-dnc/video-1968-democratic-national-convention&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68220000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68220001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">live television</a> to denounce the floor managers as “a bunch of thugs.”</p><p>And while people are well aware of the video where then-Mayor Richard J. Daley mouths profanities at Abraham Ribicoff for accusing the police of using “Gestapo tactics in the streets of Chicago,” what’s less remembered is when the Wisconsin delegation used their turn in the roll call to propose suspending the convention and moving it elsewhere. Then-House Majority Leader Carl Albert struggled to keep control of the floor and was replaced as chair by up-and-coming Chicago lawmaker Dan Rostenkowski.</p><p>Democrats are quick to point out this is not 1968, when Americans were being drafted, or even 2016, when Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders’ bitter clash led to a summer convention that included thousands of unhappy Sanders delegates. The number of delegates who are attending as “uncommitted” — the write-in protest used by Democrats angry over Biden’s handling of Gaza — will only be in the dozens.</p><p>“They’re going to be so small in numbers, this is not like 2016 or even 2008, with the PUMAs,” said former DNC Chair Donna Brazile, alluding to the Hillary Clinton diehards who refused to back Barack Obama and created a vivid acronym for Party Unity My Ass.</p><p>What alarms some Democratic strategists is the evolution of this era’s protests. Protesters are savvier — they’ve managed to get inside dozens of events featuring the president and vice president — and their demonstrations also include some bad actors who are determined to provoke a reaction.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352186801112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>In anticipation of some protesters obtaining tickets, convention organizers said they’ll stage a war room and be prepared to drown them out with chants — “four more years” is always a standby — and block any banners with Biden-Harris signs.</p><p>That’s all how to manage the convention itself.</p><p>Just as complicated is how to handle the protesters beyond the walls of the United Center.</p><p>There’s already a joke going around Democratic strategist circles that the main difference between 2024 and 1968 is that the Chicago mayor this year will be on the side of the protesters, not the cops.</p><p>Forty-eight-year-old Brandon Johnson, who was elected mayor last year after incumbent Lori Lightfoot failed to even make the runoff, was an organizer with the Chicago Teachers Union and has yet to fully make the jump from activist to mayor of one of America’s largest cities.</p><p>It’s ironic because soon after he became mayor, he hosted DNC Chair Jaime Harrison for lunch and, according to a Democrat familiar with the conversation, immediately pronounced that “nobody else represents the city but me.” He also asked if Harrison would have his back as a fellow Black man (Harrison, I’m told, tried to delicately explain that the convention would be a partnership between the party, the city and the state of Illinois).<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/32/75/010df1ef4626bc46c337b7ca217d/election-2024-democratic-convention-safety-05650.jpg" /><br /><p>“If there’s any mayor that understands the value of protest and demonstration, it’s me,” Johnson told reporters earlier this week at a groundbreaking, dismissing a question about Sen. Dick Durbin’s (D-Ill.) concerns over unrest in the city during the convention. Johnson said, “Without protests and real demands of a government, people of color and women do not have a place in society.”</p><p>More striking was how Johnson responded to whether he thought it was appropriate for police to have been dispatched last weekend to a protest at one of Chicago’s art museums. He spoke in a detached manner — the museum “made that request and the police department reacted,” the mayor said — evading the question and leaving the impression he somehow wasn’t in charge of the city and its police department.</p><p>Johnson praised the importance of protecting free speech and initially said that was paramount to safety, which he called “second most important,” before seeming to recognize his error.</p><p>When I asked him what his vision of a successful Democratic convention looked like, Johnson repeated the same formulation — “safe, vibrant and energetic” — before saying he wanted young people to “see what democracy really looks like.”</p><p>At no point did he mention Joe Biden or the importance of the convention in helping the president’s reelection.</p><p>It was an eye-opening exchange. And it made clear why so many Democrats, in Chicago and beyond, respond to questions about Johnson with a sigh and hope that he’ll recognize the weight of this moment, both for his career, the city and the country.</p><p>Exacerbating matters, Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who lobbied the White House relentlessly for the convention, have a strained relationship. They’ve disagreed on issues from immigration to a new, subsidized stadium for the Chicago Bears.</p><p>When I first saw the governor and mayor earlier in the week, it was at the Field Museum for an unveiling of an exhibit on a newly discovered bird fossil. As the two sat in the front row before the event got underway, just a single seat separating them, they looked straight ahead in silence and did not speak to one another in the way politicians of the same party almost always do in such moments.</p><p>With the demise of longtime Illinois Democratic boss (and state house speaker) Michael Madigan, though, there’s no semblance of a political machine here. What’s left is Pritzker, a billionaire who’s won two terms and can bankroll the party, and a handful of public employee unions, most notably the teachers from which Johnson emerged.</p><p>The best Democrats could say about the Johnson-Pritzker dynamic was that, well, at least it’s not as bad as the Andrew Cuomo-Bill de Blasio relationship in New York.</p><p>“It's an event that’s critical to the Democratic Party, so we’re all going to work together to make it a success,” Cook County President Toni Preckwinkle, a veteran of Chicago’s political wars, told me when I asked about the mayor and the governor.</p><p>Preckwinkle was far less enthused about a disruptive cacophony of free expression in the city. While noting she was “old enough to have been in a lot of anti-war marches,” she said that although people are free to protest, “the challenge, of course, is when people decide that expressing their opinion involves impeding other people’s ability to go to work, or go to school or acts of vandalism.”</p><p>Senior Democrats made clear they’ll mostly lean on Pritzker and his canny chief of staff, Anne Caprara, this summer.</p><p>The governor already prevailed in a proxy war with the mayor over who would run the host committee. Pritzker installed another of his lieutenants to oversee the local organization that helps put on the conclave along with the convention directors, national party and Biden campaign. Johnson was, though, able to make a member of his inner circle a senior adviser to the host committee as part of an agreement to keep peace between the mayor and governor.</p><p>It’s a détente Pritzker is eager to sustain, at least through August.</p><p>Asked at the groundbreaking this week if he was open to calling in the National Guard for the convention, the governor said he didn’t think “we’ll need it.” But Pritzker made sure to note the Chicago police had jurisdiction and he’d only call in the guard if “the city asks us to — it would be completely inappropriate to just march into a city.”<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

The approach sometimes <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20140207-ukraine-usa-eu-nuland-leaked-audio" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;got her in trouble&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.france24.com/en/20140207-ukraine-usa-eu-nuland-leaked-audio&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d682b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d682b0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">got her in trouble</a>, but it rarely held her back. </p><p>Nuland recently left the State Department after serving at its highest levels, first as the Biden administration’s undersecretary of State for political affairs, and, for several months, acting deputy secretary of State. She previously was a career diplomat who held an array of roles under presidents both Republican and Democratic; her first posting more than three decades ago was as a consular officer in China.</p><p>In an exit interview with POLITICO Magazine, Nuland discussed her time in public service — dismissing chatter that she was passed over for a promotion — as well as her views on where American foreign policy has gone wrong and right. </p><p>Notably, she said the United States was not quick enough to realize and prevent the expansionist ambitions of both Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. </p><p>A longtime champion of Ukraine and the effort to counter Russia, she also warned about the perils of Donald Trump blowing up NATO if he wins back the White House in November. </p><p>“Don’t throw it out,” she said of the trans-Atlantic alliance, “because you would never be able to re-create it again.” </p><p><i>The following has been edited for length and clarity:</i><b>&#xa0;</b></p><p><b>How’s life on the outside?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Life is wonderful. I am doing a lot of projects that I had put off, seeing a lot of people that I love, and I’m staying involved in ways that are meaningful. I’m speaking on foreign policy issues I care about — whether it is Ukraine or ensuring that the United States leads strongly in the world. I’m getting a chance to prepare for my classes in the fall and work with the next generation of foreign policy leaders. I’ll be at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs. </p><p><b>Why leave the Biden administration, really? People said you felt passed over for the deputy secretary of State job. Is that true?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I actually didn’t compete for the deputy secretary of State job. I loved being undersecretary for political affairs. I love working with Secretary [Antony] Blinken. But as you know, I’ve done three years altogether and I’ve done eight months plus in both jobs, and so it was just the right time for me and my family to do something different. </p><p><b>Do you have any regrets from your time in the role?</b></p><p>I think whenever you finish a job like this, you wish you’d been able to do more on more issues. Travel more, touch more people, get more done faster, ensure the U.S. was leading strongly on as many continents as possible, mentor more of the next generation. And you’re always constrained by time, by resources, by the crises that overwhelm the inbox. So you always want to have done more. </p><p><b>Can Ukraine win this war against Russia? And how do you define winning?</b> </p><p>Let’s start with the fact that Putin has already failed in his objective. He wanted to flatten Ukraine. He wanted to ensure that they had no sovereignty, independence, agency, no democratic future — because a democratic Ukraine, a European Ukraine, is a threat to his model for Russia, among other things, and because it’s the first building block for his larger territorial ambitions. </p><p>Can Ukraine succeed? Absolutely. Can Ukraine come out of this more sovereign, more economically independent, stronger, more European than it is now? Absolutely. And I think it will. But we’ve got to stay with it. We’ve got to make sure our allies stay with it. </p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/f8/76/0f016aa045258539dc868670ba5e/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1458232004" /><br /><p><br />And we have to accelerate a lot of the initiatives that were in the supplemental, like helping Ukraine build that highly deterrent military force of the future, like deploying these longer-range weapons to strategic effect, like ensuring that the critical infrastructure and the energy sector are protected, like building up our own defense industrial base and that of our allies and Ukraine’s again, so that we and Ukraine are building faster than Russia and China. </p><p><b>But can it get all its territory back, including Crimea?</b> </p><p>It can definitely get to a place where it’s strong enough, I believe, and where Putin is stymied enough to go to the negotiating table from a position of strength. It’ll be up to the Ukrainian people what their territorial ambitions should be. But there are certain things that are existential. </p><p>Any deal that they cut in their interest and in the larger global interest has to be a deal that Putin is compelled to stick to. We can’t be doing this every six months, every three years. It has to actually lead to a deal that includes Russian withdrawal. </p><p>Putin is a master at what we call rope-a-dope negotiating, where he never actually cuts the deal. It has to be a deal that ensures that whatever is decided on Crimea, it can’t be remilitarized such that it’s a dagger at the heart of the center of Ukraine. </p><p><b>Was it a mistake not to push the Ukrainians harder to go for some sort of negotiated end to the war in 2022, especially the fall of 2022?</b> </p><p>They were not in a strong enough position then. They’re not in a strong enough position now. The only deal Putin would have cut then, the only deal that he would cut today, at least before he sees what happens in our election, is a deal in which he says, “What’s mine is mine and what’s yours is negotiable.” And that’s not sustainable. </p><p><b>You’ve had a long career, especially when it comes to Europe. Where did the U.S. go wrong in its understanding of Russia?</b> </p><p>With regard to both Russia and China, after the end of the Cold War, the prevailing wisdom among all of us — right, left and center — was that if you could knit Moscow and Beijing into the open and free global order that we had benefited from for so many years, that they would become prosperous, and they would become strong contributing members of that order. And that’s what we tried for a very long time. </p><p>That works if you have a leadership that is fundamentally accepting the current system. But once you have leaders who are telling their populations that this system keeps their country down, doesn’t allow it to have its rightful place, that has a territorial definition of greatness, that is bent on economic, political and or military coercion — that’s antithetical to this order, and then our policy has to change. </p><p>Did we realize fast enough Putin’s ambitions and Xi Jinping’s ambitions, and did we do enough to ensure that those ambitions stayed inside their own nations and didn’t spill out and coerce others? 20/20 hindsight? Probably not. </p><p><b>How much of it comes down to what particular guy is running the show? I sometimes wonder, could things be different if it wasn’t Putin in charge? If it wasn't Xi? How much of it comes down to the dude at the top?</b> </p><p>In highly centralized societies, which both China and Russia have historically been, without an electoral refresh of the kind that we all go through in the democratic world, it matters hugely, because it’s that human who’s defining what greatness means. It’s that human who’s deciding how to maintain order in that society. It’s that human — allowing them to speak, allowing a free press, allowing protests, allowing alternative political parties — who’s going to shape the options. And that constrains obviously the kind of relationship we can have. </p><p><b>What is the lesson we should learn about foreign policy in general when it comes to the experiences we’ve had in Russia and China?</b> </p><p>We should always try to talk both to leaders and to people, to the extent that we’re allowed. We should always offer an opportunity to work together in common interest. </p> <p>But if the ideology is inherently expansionist, is inherently illiberal, is inherently trying to change the system that benefits us, we’ve got to build protections and resilience for ourselves, for our friends and allies, and particularly for those neighbors of those countries who are likely to be on the front line of that first push.</p><br /><p><b>Where do you see the Israel-Hamas war heading?</b> </p><p>Essentially, there are two paths on the table. There is continuing this war with all of the destruction and horror and lack of clarity about how you end Hamas’ reign of terror. </p><p>The other path is the route that the administration and allies and partners and a lot of countries in the Gulf are pushing, and a lot of Israelis want, which is: a hostage deal leads to a long-term cease-fire, leads to a better future for Palestinians both in the West Bank and in Gaza, leads to Saudi-Israel normalization and a path to two states, and a region where the ideology and the violence that Hamas is offering is beaten by more opening, more opportunity, more peace, more stability. </p><p><b>Are you saying that because you believe it or because it’s the Biden administration’s position?</b> </p><p>I’m saying it because, anything other than that, this is going to happen again and again and again. </p><p><b>If you could go back in time on that one, what, if anything, should the U.S. have done differently?</b> </p><p>Beginning with the Trump administration, everybody fell in love with regional normalization as the cure-all for the instability and grievances and insecurity in the Middle East. And that’s a part of it. </p><p>But if you leave out the Palestinian issue, then somebody’s going to seize it and run with it, and that’s what Hamas did. I also think that both we and the Israelis knew too little about the terror state that had been established in Gaza. </p><p><b>You’re going to be teaching at Columbia, the epicenter of campus protests over this situation. If you could offer these protesters some advice as someone with significant policymaking experience, what would it be?</b> </p><p>Peaceful protest is part of the fabric of who we are and the fact that we allow it, and the Chinese don’t and the Russians don’t, makes us Americans. But when that protest becomes violent, when it impinges on other people’s human rights or denigrates others, then you veer toward coercion. </p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352186801112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><br />So, express your views, ask for concrete paths forward. But stay away from violence, make sure that it’s actually indigenous to the campus, that you’re not becoming the tool of outside agitators. And be respectful of alternative views as you expect people to respect your views. </p><p><b>What if you are peaceful? And you say what you want and the people in charge just say, ‘Oh, that’s very nice, thank you,’ and then they ignore you and they keep doing what they’ve been doing for years. How do you do just keep pushing on that front? Do you join the government?</b> </p><p>I would certainly say if you care enough to devote all day, every day to political change, come join the folks who are setting policy, commit your life to public service. I didn’t expect that that’s where my life would lead, but it’s been incredibly rewarding. </p><p>There are many, many ways to change policy, but being on the inside is not only extremely rewarding, but you can actually get stuff done. </p><p><b>If Trump wins, and leaves NATO or limits America’s role in NATO, does the alliance fall apart? What happens?</b> </p><p>First and foremost, America suffers. Because if you look at every single one of the challenges we have globally, even as we make the security commitment to Europe, it is the European countries who have contributed more to Ukraine — on the security side, on the economic side, etc. It is the European countries who have to adapt their policies toward China if you want to have an impact on China’s eagerness to coerce others. It’s the European countries who we need to help fund the Haiti mission, to help defeat terrorism in Africa, and provide prosperity. </p><p>If we are not part of that family, on a daily basis, we are standing alone, our own influence in the world is greatly reduced, and we have no influence over how they choose to spend their energy and resources. And they’re less powerful in doing it without us. </p><p><b>What about this idea that look, we’re the U.S. at the end of the day. We’re the superpower. Whether we’re in NATO or not, people are going to come along with us. Isn’t there something to that argument?</b> </p><p>I’ve worked for six presidents, Republicans and Democrats. I always believed that a new president with a fresh mandate from the American people should look at every global problem with fresh eyes, bring new solutions, and should have that opportunity, working with Congress, working with the American people, working with allies and partners. </p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/67/dc/fa06a6f441f8b1a974cd879bada8/u-s-congress-08624.jpg" /><br /><p><br />That’s a different thing than turning your back on bedrock, bipartisan institutions and policies that have protected Americans and advanced our own prosperity and global influence for 70 years. </p><p>Why do you want to throw out what’s working and what benefits us for no other reason than you’ve had a fit of pique? Work within the institution to make it work better. Don’t throw it out, because you would never be able to re-create it again. </p><p><b>Does the rest of the world fear the United States?</b> </p><p>Is fear what we want from the rest of the world? </p><p><b>Sometimes.</b> </p><p>I think what we want from the rest of the world is they see us leading in a manner that advances their own security, advances their own prosperity, creates this community of nations that can handle global problems — whether they are terrorist problems, whether they are health problems, whether they’re environmental problems — and we do it in a primarily self-interested but unselfish way, and we’re creating that community. </p><p>They should only fear us if they’re opponents of a largely liberal democratic way of advancing human prosperity. And in that context, if they are viciously invading a neighbor, if they are coercing a little state because they can, then I hope they would fear our reaction and the reaction that we will build with other democracies who want to protect the system that favors freedom. </p><p><b>Do you ever plan to go back into government?</b> </p><p>I love what I did for 35 years. I’ve always loved it. And I continue to love it. So in the right circumstances, of course.</p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

The voice was close to SNL-worthy.</p><p>“Mike is straight out of central casting,” fake Trump said.</p><p>This is true. Johnson, a former high school thespian, is boyish and nerdy and exudes a southern sweetness that even his most vociferous critics don’t deny.</p><p>“He’s a good speaker of the House,” he continued.</p> <p>That would have been highly debatable not long ago, but Johnson is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/08/mike-johnson-house-speaker-congress-00156764" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;enjoying a period of renewed respect&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/08/mike-johnson-house-speaker-congress-00156764&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">enjoying a period of renewed respect</a>, particularly after avoiding a shutdown and pushing through aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Most House Republicans are now more frustrated with far-right members who make Johnson’s life difficult than they are with Johnson. Democrats rewarded him for his streak of responsible governing by saving him from a motion to vacate.</p><p>“I’ve liked him!” Johnson-as-Trump boasted.</p><p>Also true. Johnson seems to have picked the lock of Trump relationship management, getting the former president to stand down on the aid package and the motion to vacate.</p><p>So if that Trump impersonation makes it sound like the speaker is in a good mood, it’s because he is.</p><p>A few hours after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s attempt to oust him was easily defeated, Johnson sat down for an interview with the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Deep Dive podcast&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683a0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Deep Dive podcast</a> in the speaker’s suite, where he sat under a painting of his idol Ronald Reagan and answered questions for over an hour.<br /></p><br /><p>Johnson said he would not try to defund the office of special counsel Jack Smith, as sought by Greene.</p><p>The longtime social conservative said he wouldn’t try to pass a nationwide abortion ban if Republicans won full control of Washington in November, citing Trump’s call to let states decide the matter.</p><p>He also talked about Israel, January 6, the future of conservatism and his relationships with key Washington leaders, such as Joe Biden (his age “concerns me deeply”), Hakeem Jeffries (“a good family man”), Kevin McCarthy (“I have a lot of sympathy for” him), and, of course, Donald Trump, who, Johnson noted, has never heard his impersonation but thinks he would like it.</p><p>“Imitation,” he said, “is the greatest form of flattery.”</p><p><i>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity with help from Deep Dive senior producer Alex Keeney.</i><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/41/22/33f4e43240e5831170641ada3f65/u-s-congress-18782.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Lizza: So let's start with the motion to vacate. That resolution said that you aided and abetted Democrats in destroying our country, and 11 Republicans agreed with that and voted not to table it. Which of the 11 Republicans surprised you the most?</b></p><p>I haven't even studied the list. I haven't had time after the vote on the floor.</p><p><b>Lizza: You want to hear it? Biggs. Burlison. Crane. Davidson. Gosar. Greene. Massie. Mooney. Moore of Alabama. Roy and Spartz.&#xa0;</b></p><p>Hmm, I'd say several of those surprise me.</p><p>Look, those are all friends and colleagues I’ve worked with for a long time. I would not read too much into the voting against the motion to table. In fact, a couple of those folks told me privately that they would never have voted to vacate, and they wished it hadn't happened; but for some reason, they felt like it was important not to go on record against, or to be in favor of the motion to table.</p><p>I don't quite understand the rationale there, but I'll take them at their word. Look, we have a job to do here. We have to govern. I'm glad that that was done. Let's rip the Band-Aid off and get it done. I regret that it had to come to that. I spent a lot of time over the last couple days talking with Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene and even Paul Gosar about it. It's the way I operate. It's the way I've been leading since I got the job.</p><p>I take thoughts, suggestions, ideas from members all the time, almost on an hourly basis. And when they're constructive ideas, we try to implement them. That's how you do this job, especially when you have the smallest majority in U.S. history and a one-vote margin. You need every member on the team to feel like they're contributing and feel like they have a say in it. And so it's a gigantic part of every day here. That's what I was doing with them, and I didn't think they would go through with it.</p><p>But you know what? I went up and talked to all three of the ones who brought the motion, Thomas and Marjorie too before we left the chamber. They were some of the last to leave. And, I said, “You know what? I don't carry grudges, and I'm not angry about this. We have to work together. And I want to work with you guys and those ideas we were talking about. I'm still working on them, so I hope we can put this behind us and move forward.”</p><p><b>Bade: Did they say why they chose to do this [on Wednesday] after saying they'd give you some time to answer their requests?&#xa0;</b></p><p>They didn't have an answer for that. I think I probably surprised them by my approach and demeanor on it. But who knows? I can't get in the mind of anybody else. What I do know is that we have an important job to do here.</p><p>These are perilous times for the country. There are hot wars around the globe. We have allies in jeopardy, our border’s wide open. The cost of living is through the roof. The crime rate’s through the roof. We’ve got antisemitism and angry mobs on college campuses. This is no time for frivolous, palace intrigue and politics.</p><p>We have got to have a functioning Congress, and I think the landslide vote against removing the speaker is a signal that I think people on both sides of the aisle obviously understand this is not a time for games.</p><p><b>Lizza: Having said that, I think people are curious for you to just take us inside these negotiations that you had this week with Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene. Rachael reported that there were at least three demands: the “Hastert Rule,” no more aid to Ukraine and defunding Jack Smith's special counsel office. Are those on the table for you?</b></p><p>Well, first of all, there weren't negotiations. I did to Thomas and Marjorie exactly what I do with all members of the conference. As I said, people come in all the time with ideas and we process them. I don't make snap judgments.</p><p>On the Hastert Rule, as it's called, there are a couple of instances where there wasn't the majority of Republicans [voting for a bill on the floor]. One was in the appropriations process. But as I explained to the two of them in my office, we did have a whip count that did have a majority of Republicans. Eight people flipped at the last minute. And that's not something the speaker can control. We didn't break the rule. I've been following the Hastert Rule since the day I got the gavel.</p><p>The Ukraine vote got slightly fewer Republicans that voted for it, but that vote wasn't whipped. And so the Hastert Rule has never been violated so long as I've been involved. And I have no intention of doing so. So agreeing to that wasn't a negotiation. I just affirmed, yeah, I'm already committed to that.</p><p>With regard to Ukraine funding, I don't expect that there's any further request for funding before the end of this year. That was their demand. And I said, I'm already working under that assumption. So you're not asking me to do anything that I haven't already thought and resolved to do.</p><p>And then with regard to defunding Jack Smith, look, I think that there's been a terrible dereliction of duty with regard to the special counsel and how the whole system has been abused, and how they've engaged in lawfare against President Trump. All of these things are, to me, self-evident truths.</p><p>But that's not something you wave a wand and just eliminate the special counsel as a provision. It's been part of the law, you know, the tradition and the law for 25 years. Before that, it was the independent counsel. And I explained to both of them, as a former constitutional law attorney and litigator myself, that there is a necessity for a function like that, because sometimes the Department of Justice, which is an executive branch agency, can't necessarily, without a conflict of interest, investigate or prosecute the president who's their boss or the president's family. So you have to have some functioning equivalent of that.</p><p><b>Bade: So are you prepared then to stick this into appropriations bills to defund the special counsel?&#xa0;</b></p><p>No.</p><p>We were in the very beginning stages of even beginning to investigate what that would look like. I do think there has to be accountability. Congress has the power of the purse, of course. And we have oversight responsibility. And we've been vigorously using both of those powers. I think we need to look very closely at how we address what I regard to be special counsels that are outside the bounds of what they're intended and supposed to do. But no decisions were made about any of that yet.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/f6/ba/5580b97e4c98bb2c999171391b9a/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2148449338" /><br /><p><b>Lizza: On the motion to vacate, I want to ask you about the role of former President Trump. He came out full-throated against it, but he also said at some point he may favor a motion to vacate. So, a couple of questions. One is how did you neutralize Trump on this issue? And do you worry about that latter part of the statement that sounds a bit like a threat?</b></p><p>No, I don't take it as a threat. I was with President Trump this past weekend at Mar-a-Lago, and he invited me up on the stage. I was the only other person besides him who spoke, when there were potential vice presidential picks on the stage.</p><p>He's been very supportive. I know him very well. We’ve worked together for almost eight years now. We came to Washington at the same time, and we worked together very well over that period. I have always been very forthright with him and very honest, and told him what I thought was in his best interest, in the country's best interest, even if sometimes he didn't necessarily agree. But on reflection, he often says, “Mike is a really good guy. He's doing a really hard job.”</p><p>I think we have a very good relationship of trust. And he knows that when I advise him of something or give him an idea or tell him something I have to do, I think he appreciates that I'm operating in good faith. And that means a lot to President Trump.</p><p>I believe he's going to be elected president again. And I think if I'm serving as speaker and I intend to be, I think he and I having a close relationship will be very important for the country because we have a lot of problems to fix.</p><p><b>Bade: Some Republicans say that you are only speaker right now because of him. Do you agree?</b></p><p>Well, I don't know. He did throw in an endorsement of me when the speaker's race was ongoing. We all remember well, we closed Congress for three weeks because we didn't have a speaker.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/55/07/2561db7444a9b0dc14a207b3ec58/house-of-representatives-63249.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Lizza: It’s all a blur?</b></p><p>Yes, it's all a blur to me. The entire last six months is a blur to me in some way.</p><p>But this is an important thing to say: I never aspired to be speaker of the House. This was not on my bucket list. I was quite content to be a lieutenant. I was on the leadership team, and I worked against the motion to vacate for Kevin McCarthy. I then worked to get Steve Scalise elected speaker, and Jim Jordan and the more senior guys who are very close friends of mine. And it didn't happen.</p><p>I was sitting in the back of the room as that played out. I had a sense that I could get 217 votes, but I didn't jump forward and put myself out there as a candidate because that's not my way.</p><p>Somebody told me — I had a mentor when I was in eighth grade — and they said, “Mike, always remember this: Real leadership is recognized and not imposed.” And I've thought about that a lot over my life, and I'm not the type of person who puts myself out there and says, “I'm going to be the leader.” To me, you let other people recognize it and call you forward. And that's ultimately what happened.</p><p><b>Lizza: The fact that you mentioned a mentor just reminded me of something. Rep. Chip Roy was your mentor when you were a freshman.&#xa0;</b></p><p>Actually, it was the opposite. I was his mentor. I did an exceptional job with that, didn’t I?</p><p><b>Lizza: So does that one sting? Is there a particular sting from his criticism, given the history of that relationship?&#xa0;</b></p><p>It doesn't. Look, I regard Chip as a friend. He’s an interesting character.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/1b/9c/d68a360a4e92905f5643fdf5a4ab/u-s-congress-67015.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Lizza: You’re very forgiving.</b></p><p>Well, that's my worldview. I'm a Bible-believing Christian. That's one of the first commands we have. You're supposed to love your enemies. Nobody in this building is my enemy. We have political opposition and people on the other side of the aisle and even sometimes people in our own camp, but they're not enemies. They're all colleagues and friends. I regard them all as such. You know, the Bible's very clear. You're supposed to bless even those who persecute you. I'm getting a lot of practice in that right now. But there's lots of biblical admonitions that apply here. “A soft word turns away wrath.”</p><p>You get a lot further in a legislative body when you can build relationships with people and work on building trust among colleagues. And that's what I do. That's just the way I live. And so I'm not angry at anybody about it. Chip's still going to be my friend.</p><p><b>Lizza: President Biden told CNN that if Israel invades Rafah, the U.S. will stop supplying it with artillery shells and other offensive weapons. His quote was, “If they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons.” Very, very clear. What's your view of that?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I was informed about that about 10 minutes before I walked in this room. And my reaction honestly, was, “Wow.” That is a complete turn from what I have been told, even in recent hours. I mean, 24 hours ago, it was confirmed to me by top administration officials that the policy's very different than what he stated there. So I hope that's a senior moment.</p><p><b>Lizza: Wait, can you just explain that?</b></p><p>I was in the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/what-scif-who-uses-it-n743991" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;SCIF having classified discussions&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/what-scif-who-uses-it-n743991&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683b0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">SCIF having classified discussions</a> with some top administration officials. The subject matter of my concern, I can tell you, was we got word about <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/us-concerns-over-israels-gaza-policy-led-to-weapons-holdup-00156528" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the shipment of munitions being delayed&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/us-concerns-over-israels-gaza-policy-led-to-weapons-holdup-00156528&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683b0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683b0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the shipment of munitions being delayed</a>. And that was a great concern to us because I got commitments from top administration officials before we passed the supplemental package for the aid to Israel that that would not happen. And there would be no delay whatsoever. They repeat it to me in writing and verbally, no delay in the delivery of weapons to Israel because it's so desperately needed.</p><p>So yesterday I talked with Prime Minister Netanyahu about it, and I wanted to get confirmation from him exactly what's happening. And he described exactly what was happening — before the news was confirmed.</p><p><b>Lizza: Before Biden’s statement?</b></p><p>Well, this is well before the statement. We were just hearing rumors [about the delayed munitions]. So I confirmed it with Prime Minister Netanyahu. And then I went straight to the White House and I said, ”What gives? Somebody's going to have to explain this to me because it's very different than what I was told.”</p><p>And they said, “Oh, this has nothing to do with the supplemental package that you all passed. This is the earlier weapons tranches.” “Well, Israel needs it right now.” “Well we're working on that.” “Well you better work on it quickly.”</p><p>So this statement by the president, I hope — I believe he's off script. I don't think that's something that staff told him to say. I hope it's a senior moment because that would be a great deviation in what is said to be the policy there and in the very critical relationship we have with Israel.</p><p><b>Lizza: Do you feel betrayed by this then?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I got to say that I do. We've been very deliberate. We've been very open, very much in good faith. The Congress expressed its will through that vote. And so for the administration to make such a huge deviation in policy without any consultation with us and in defiance of what we quite literally just voted on here, days ago. To me, it raises a lot of alarm.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/6a/73/4058cdff445688d2aeadb8bb169a/u-s-congress-57021.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Bade: A lot of your Republican colleagues say that they find Biden to be senile. You've talked a lot with him through these negotiations. Do you agree with that?</b></p><p>I don't know if I'm in any position to diagnose his mental acuity. But look, I will say, it's not personal, but everyone ages differently. It's physiology or what have you. Everybody's different. My father-in-law is the same age as Joe Biden, and he acts as though he's 20 years younger. He's vibrant, he works long days, he still runs his business that he's been running for many years. He's on his A-game.</p><p>To be candid, I don't believe President Biden is. And it concerns me deeply. I take no pleasure in saying that because I think it's a dangerous thing for the country. I think that our adversaries see him in the same way that many Americans do. And I think that's a very dangerous thing for us right now, because that's why our adversaries are acting so provocatively. I believe in Reagan's principles. He reminded us that we maintain peace through strength. And if America doesn't project strength, it's a great concern to free people around the world. And you see the results.</p><p><b>Bade: What gives you the impression that Biden has lost a step a little bit with age?</b></p><p>You know, I don't want to violate any personal confidences or anything, but I've had private conversations with him, of course. But you don't need to rely upon my reflection of a private conversation. You can see him in public, in his public statements. And it's important.</p><p><b>Lizza: One more thing about President Biden. </b><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/biden-federal-funds-spending-tracking" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;b>POLITICO reported in a very important investigation&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/biden-federal-funds-spending-tracking&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683b0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683b0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>POLITICO reported in a very important investigation</b></a><b> that billions of dollars from Biden's four big 2021 and 2022 legislative packages remain unspent. Have you thought about clawing back that unspent money from those four bills, and what you might spend it on?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Well, the principle of clawing back unspent dollars is an easy yes. But of course the devil's in the details. I'm not sure what categories those are, what accounts they're in, what it was dedicated for. If we have the ability to claw it back, we could certainly use that money.</p><p>Right now, we've got $35.5 trillion in federal debt. And we're working every day on restoring the principles of fiscal sanity here. One of the things we're trying to do, for example, is break up the governance by omnibus. We got a first stab at it. We broke the last spending package into two minibuses. And now we're going to actually endeavor to do 12 separate appropriations bills for fiscal year 2025.</p><p><b>Bade: How are you going to do that when a bunch of your members are sinking rules left and right? You weren't able to do all 12 bills last time. What makes you think you can this year?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Well, the reason I'm such an optimist about this is because I handle this situation and this challenge like every other. We're going to set up listening sessions when we get back next week to have everybody come in. We'll begin with the topline spending numbers, build consensus on that.</p><p>We're going to do something that's also innovative: We're going to start with an actual number that everybody can agree to on the front end, not waste time negotiating that. Then the appropriators can begin their process, methodically taking each of the bills, working that through the committee process.</p><p>I met with <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/20/grow-up-a-veteran-republican-is-tired-of-his-partys-insurgents-00153454" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Tom Cole&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/20/grow-up-a-veteran-republican-is-tired-of-his-partys-insurgents-00153454&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683b0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683b0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Tom Cole</a>, who's our Appropriations chair, and he says, “We can do that.” We can produce those bills by the end of the summer and get them ready for movement on the floor. We'd like to do that and get it through the House and send it over to the Senate, and then dare Chuck Schumer not to do his job. I think that that would be fun for the House to jam the Senate for a change.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Bade: Tom Cole said that you were going to mark up the bills at the levels that have already been negotiated with Democrats, not try to do this thing that McCarthy did, where you cut like $100 billion or some such. Again, you think conservatives are going to vote for appropriations bills at that level?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Well, I can tell you, I've talked to a number of House Freedom Caucus members, Chip Roy and others, and many of them have already said it’s the number that was already negotiated. I think it's $1.606 or $1.621 trillion.</p><p>But there is a number that everyone has already agreed to. The thing that people rejected last time was the so-called “side deals” and “gimmicks” and all the other stuff on the outside.</p><p><b>Lizza: We want to ask you about some of your fellow leaders in Congress. Let's start with Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader. Like you, he's a religious man. Have you gotten to know Jeffries as a brother in Christ?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I have. Hakeem is a good man. We’ve worked well together. We have a lot more in common than people might think. You know, he's from New York and I'm from Louisiana. While we have lots of disagreements on policies and the fine points of policy, I think you can appreciate people for who they are as a person. I think that's what we're called to do. And he and I both kind of share the worldview on that. I can appreciate that he's a good family man. We have a lot in common in that regard. And he lost his father recently, I lost mine three days before I got elected to Congress. We've talked about that.</p><p>We've talked about how he and I both came to our leadership positions in a rather circuitous fashion that neither of us predicted or expected, in terms of timing and how we would be elevated as we were. He's been here a little bit longer than I have been. But, there are things that we have in common.</p><p>And I think what we've appreciated about one another is that I believe that when Hakeem Jeffries is telling me something, I believe he's telling me the truth. I believe he is a man of his word. And I think he believes that about me as well. That's a big thing in Washington. You know, trust is a rare commodity around here.</p><p>While we don't agree on many things, it's really refreshing to sit across the table from someone who is your political adversary and know that they're shooting straight. I wish that we could have a lot more of that around here because it would solve a lot of problems. Look, I'm a Reagan Republican. I love the way he did the job. He was a happy warrior, you know?</p><p>He was a hero to all of us. I think to all Republicans, he's still the standard-bearer. And the reason is because of the way he did the job. He's very principled. But he didn't hate anybody, right?</p><p>Reagan and [Democratic Speaker] Tip O'Neill famously had this great relationship. And after his assassination attempt, Tip O'Neill goes to the hospital and kisses him on the forehead. They didn't agree on almost anything, but they had respect for one another. And I think we’ve got to get back to that. I think America needs more of that.</p><p>The person on the other side of the aisle is not an enemy. They're a fellow American. Our enemies are like Hamas and Hezbollah and the people who are trying to kill us. These are our political adversaries. The Founders anticipated that you have people with very different philosophical ideas, very different principles and ideas about government, but we would come here, sit around a table and arm wrestle together and kind of get to a point of consensus so that we can govern the country. This system doesn't work unless you understand the principles that undergird it. And I think restoring those principles is really important for this institution to endure.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/bc/7e/3c0e7eed4866be32b9cfe6b4694c/house-of-representatives-61396.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Bade: You talk about Republicans you admire. Let's talk about a more controversial Republican leader: Kevin McCarthy. When you were elected speaker, did he ever call you and offer any advice? Did you ever seek his counsel?&#xa0;</b></p><p>He did early on. Look, I was on the leadership team under Speaker McCarthy. I was the vice chairman of the House Republican Conference. It’s the No. 6 leadership position. It was funny because when I became speaker, it was like “Who is this mysterious man?” I was like, “I've been on leadership for three years. You guys didn't know what the vice chairman of the Republican conference is? Come on.”</p><p>It was meaningless, but I was on the team. I was at the table, and I was trying to help advance the agenda. And, you know, Kevin was good to me. It was a very painful thing that happened to him. I mean, it was an unprecedented thing. Vacating the chair was devastating to all of us, and it was like being part of a traumatic experience that lasted and endured for too long.</p><p>There was a lot of pain for him personally, I'm sure, that came out of that. But in spite of that, I spoke at his farewell party that they threw for him, this big gathering a couple weeks later. He reached out multiple times in the beginning to offer assistance and try to help. To his credit, you know, that was a tough thing. It's a tough thing. And he knew that I had no ulterior motive. I was never involved in trying to remove him or anything. I think we still have that mutual respect.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/e1/94/89e160fa4df9904170cfb26ebd28/mag-lizza-deepdive-johnson-015.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Bade: Where do you think McCarthy went wrong as speaker? And what are you doing to make sure you don't fall into those traps?&#xa0;</b></p><p>It's not my place to judge my predecessor. I think because our margin was so small and Kevin had such a difficult time obtaining the gavel in the first place — we went 15 rounds right before he was elected speaker — he had a challenge from day one, and when they reduced the motion to vacate threshold to one, it was always a sword of Damocles hanging over his head.</p><p>So I have a lot of sympathy for Kevin or anybody who serves in a position like this at a time like this. With all those factors, it's extremely difficult to do and to navigate those tough waters. I think history will record that he did the best he could under the circumstances. And that's exactly what I'm trying to do every day.</p><p><b>Lizza: It's interesting to hear you talk about bipartisanship and this respect for the famous relationship that Reagan and Tip O'Neill had. We're not really living in those times these days, obviously.</b></p><p><b>One of the biggest sources of friction in the country is the aftermath of the 2020 election and January 6th. Do you have any regrets about the role that you played after the 2020 presidential election, including the amicus brief in support of Texas' lawsuit challenging the election results?&#xa0;</b></p><p>No, I don't. My point in the amicus brief — people often ask me about this and they never read the brief — was a very simple and very profoundly important legal question. And that is, was the plain language of the Constitution violated in the days that led up to the 2020 election? And it very clearly was, because the language of the Constitution says plainly the state legislatures are the bodies in each of the states that determine the process by which electors are chosen. In a presidential election year, it's a critically important thing.</p><p>The operative language there is “state legislatures.” It doesn't mean election officials, secretaries of state, governors or any other body. And what happened because of Covid was everything was different. Everything was irregular. Some in good faith, and others not in such good faith, began to act at state levels to change their laws. They thought, “This is a presidential election year. How will people vote? Well, maybe we should do mail-in ballots to every voter in the state. Maybe we should put unmanned drop boxes in public parks for people to drop off their ballots. Maybe we should do all these things.”</p><p>Some of that was well-intended, perhaps. But the problem is, none of that was ratified by state legislatures because the legislatures weren't meeting and they don't do proxy voting. By extension, that clearly violated the plain language of the Constitution.</p><p>Now remember my background as a constitutional law attorney. For 20 years, I litigated constitutional questions in the courts. And to me, this was just such a plain and very important question to be answered. The only mechanism we had to present that to the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court, was to attach it along to that Texas case that was going to be before the court. That's why the amicus brief was filed there. The Supreme Court dodged the question. Perhaps they calculated that the answer was so profound, it would be so unsettling, and it was not worth them addressing, but well.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/4e/2e/f1bc0daf4db5abad3352ea40b815/house-speakership-election-27457.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Lizza: There was also a question of whether there was a remedy.&#xa0;</b></p><p>Maybe so. But listen, I think fidelity to the Constitution, even in difficult times, is critically important for us. And I thought that was an important question to pose to the court. And so you asked me if I regret that? I don't. I would do the exact same thing today if the circumstances were presented, because I feel like I have a duty. I'm an officer of the Congress and I have a responsibility. We take an oath to uphold the Constitution, and if it's plainly on its face not being followed, I have an obligation as an officer of this body to present that to the judicial branch.</p><p><b>Lizza: So if you were speaker on January 6, 2021, would you have done anything differently?</b></p><p>I don't know. I've never thought — I've never tried to assess that. That was an unprecedented moment at a very difficult time in the country. I'm not sure what I would have done at that point.</p><p><b>Lizza: Some like lightning round questions: Do you anticipate putting forward any legislation on abortion before the election?</b></p><p>No.</p><p><b>Bade: If there is Republican control of both chambers of Congress and the White House next year, do you anticipate passing any sort of nationwide abortion ban?</b></p><p>No, I don't.</p><p>President Trump said this is in the states' purview now. After the <i>Dobbs</i> decision, I think that's where it is. Look, I am a lifelong pro-lifer. I'm a product of a teen pregnancy. And so I believe in the sanctity of human life. It's also an important article of faith for me. But I have 434 colleagues here. All of us have our own, philosophical principles that we live by, but you have to have a political consensus.</p><p>[Andrew] Breitbart said, politics is downstream from culture. He's right. Before you can have political consensus on a very contentious issue like this, you have to have cultural consensus. And I think there's a lot of work to do to build a culture of life and educate people on the importance of that and to really live up to the principles of our nation's birth certificate, which is the declaration that “all men are created equal.” And there's value in that. But we have a long way to go to build the political consensus here to do anything in that regard.</p><p><b>Lizza<i>:</i> Do you think the president should have absolute immunity from prosecution?</b></p><p>Which president? And when?</p><p><b>Lizza: I think you know </b><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/27/supreme-court-trump-immunity-00154744" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;b>the origin of this question&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/27/supreme-court-trump-immunity-00154744&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683c0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>the origin of this question</b></a><b>.</b></p><p>Certainly when a president is serving in office, there must be an immunity clause, because otherwise he would be looking over his shoulder on every critical decision.</p><p><b>Lizza: But not <i>absolute</i> immunity. Come on.</b></p><p>Well, no, look, I do think it's important. I mean, whoever is the commander-in-chief, if you're elected by all the people in this country, you should be trusted with the office. And we need the person, having given them that trust, to be able to make critical decisions on a dime without worrying about some sort of liability for it. I think that's a really important principle.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/d8/fd/64f1237844e2b9e8f4dc31baf93f/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2148449320" /><br /><p><b>Lizza: As a constitutional scholar yourself?</b></p><p>Look, it's not a question I've wrestled with. I might write you a long dissertation on it, give me some time to think it through. But I think as a general premise, I think it makes sense to most people. I think it's common sense that you can't have the president sitting in the Oval Office worried about whether some lawyer or some local D.A. somewhere is going to go after him. It'd be a serious problem.</p><p><b>Lizza: This is going to be one of the strangest segues ever, but you were a high school thespian, and you're well known for your political impersonations. What is your best impersonation of a politician?</b></p><p>I do some Trump. I do some Clay Higgins, my colleague down from Louisiana.</p><p><b>Lizza: Let's hear the Trump.</b></p><p><i>[As Trump:] </i>You don't want to hear that. You don't want to hear that today, okay? Because Mike is straight out of central casting. You do want to hear that. He's a good speaker of the House. I've liked him.</p><p><b>Lizza: Have you done it for him?</b></p><p>I don't know if I have done it for him. I've done it for a lot of other people. Look, imitation is the greatest form of flattery.</p><p><b>Lizza: Do you feel like he's got enough of a sense of humor that he would be okay?</b></p><p>Oh, yeah. No, he would laugh. We have a good time together. I think he'd be flattered by it. People love that. It humanizes him. And I think he's got thick skin.</p><p><b>Lizza: You think Donald Trump has thick skin?</b></p><p>I do, I really do.</p><p><b>Lizza: I mean, of all the things about Donald Trump, I don't think anyone's ever accused him of having thick skin.</b></p><p>They're not assessing what he's been enduring. I've been taking arrows here for six months. Donald Trump has taken nuclear incoming every single day since he came down the golden staircase. I mean, you can't say that guy's not tough as nails. No one else could endure what he has had to endure. Nobody.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/69/d6/fc1ac97443a4b1c9be74cc0de7fb/mag-lizza-deepdive-johnson-014.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Bade: Let's talk about a future Speaker Johnson. You said recently that you’re planning to lead the conference beyond November. But you also said it's your job to keep the majority. So if you lose the majority, will you step down from leadership?&#xa0;</b></p><p>You know, I haven't come to that bridge to cross yet. I'm working very hard at that. My team calculated after we left Mar-A-Lago this past weekend that I'd been to 101 cities in the last five and a half months and over half the states. We are working around the clock quite literally every day to ensure that we grow the majority.</p><p><b>Lizza: We do this thing on this show where the last question is always something from our previous guest — who happened to be </b><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/05/04/jerry-nadler-antisemitism-bill-00156105" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;b>Rep.

Jerry Nadler</b></a><b>. His question was: What do you think is the future of democracy in this country?</b></p><p>I am very bullish on the future. I genuinely believe what Reagan said. Actually, Lincoln said it first. But Reagan reminded us that we are the last, best hope of man on the earth, this constitutional republic, that we have a grand experiment on the world stage. We turn 248 years old on July 4th. It's a big birthday for us. We’re coming up on 250 years. That is about the average lifespan of many great societies and cultures and we're coming to a moment. Doctor Os Guinness is an author friend of mine, and he wrote a book.</p><p><b>Lizza: You had him on your podcast.</b></p><p>I did. He's brilliant. He says that there comes a moment in a great society, a civilizational moment, where the people have to decide whether they are going to tie themselves in again to the founding principles that made that great society, or they're going to jettison that in exchange for something else. And he makes the point that over history, every time the jettison has happened, it's destroyed the culture. We have to make that decision now.</p><p><b>Lizza: On one of those podcasts, you noted that Trumpism was <i>necessary</i>, but that you were also concerned about what is being lost from traditional conservatism. What do you think is being lost?&#xa0;</b></p><p>So in 2019, I got elected to be chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the largest caucus of conservatives in Congress. At that time, we had 158 members. All the self-described conservatives in the House are part of that group. And so I stood in front of my peers and I said, gee, thanks for making me the chair. Here's what I want to posit to you all. This is 2019, two years into the Trump administration. It was a tumultuous time in the country for lots of reasons. And I felt like a lot of people back home and some of my own colleagues in the building, we were losing our sense of who we are. Like, what does it mean to be an American conservative?</p><p>I said, y'all forgive me. I'm from Louisiana. Everything's explained in either a football or hurricane metaphor. But using the hurricane metaphor, we're in uncharted waters. We feel like we've lost the rudder and we're afloat on this tumultuous sea.</p><p>I think if we created a working group to come up with a definition of American conservatism today, I think it would come down to a simple list. Today I would posit what I call the seven core principles of American conservatism. I said, I think it boils down to this: individual freedom, limited government, the rule of law, peace through strength, fiscal responsibility, free markets and human dignity. We need to be able to speak with greater clarity, conviction and consistency right now than we ever have, because people need answers and we can't go out and just say what we're against; we have to say we're for. I call them the core principles of American conservatism, but I actually think they’re the core principles of America. I think that's the reason that we became the great nation that we are, and I think we're losing it.</p><p><b>Lizza: That's not Trump's list though.&#xa0;</b></p><p>I think he's pursuing most of those principles. I really do. Now, he might define it differently — as many, many colleagues and conservatives do.</p><p>We have people in the building who have disdain for those founding principles. I mean openly, they would rather trade those for something else. They envision that we should be some sort of European-style socialist utopia or something. I believe that's a fool's errand. And so my job every day is to, in the most winsome way I can, be a happy warrior, as Reagan envisioned, to try to advance and advocate for those core principles that I think are going to help us save the Republic.</p><p><b>Lizza: What do you want us to ask our next guest?</b></p><p>How about, what makes you proud to be an American? That's a good one.</p><p><b>Lizza: What's your answer?</b></p><p>The idea that we do live in the greatest country in the history of the world. I don't even think it's close. And I don't have any problem defending that. You know, I'm a lawyer. And if you gave me time, I’d put on my full case to prove it.</p><p><i>Listen to this episode of Playbook Deep Dive on </i><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;i>Apple&lt;/i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683d0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>Apple</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0YmkWN5cyxuqBh5Vl78yGp?si=2efebaede0b8453e" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;i>Spotify&lt;/i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/0YmkWN5cyxuqBh5Vl78yGp?si=2efebaede0b8453e&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683d0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d683d0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>Spotify</i></a><i>, or wherever you get your podcasts.</i><br /></p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

The real threat of jail — no matter <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/06/trump-jail-time-gag-order-hush-money-trial-00156388" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715380728567,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-ded5-dc74-abc3-dfd5a14d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715380728567,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-ded5-dc74-abc3-dfd5a14d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/06/trump-jail-time-gag-order-hush-money-trial-00156388&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-64a8-d3a0-a5df-65ab8cce0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;how insistent he is that he’d proudly walk into Rikers&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-64a8-d3a0-a5df-65ab8cce0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">how insistent he is that he’d proudly walk into Rikers</a> — has thus far made him largely respect the gag order this week.</p><p>The timing of Merchan’s warning came at an especially inopportune time for Trump. On Tuesday and Thursday, the former president was forced to sit and listen to explosive and at times lewd testimony from Stormy Daniels, who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/trump-hush-money-trial-stormy-daniels-testimony-00156744" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;described in some detail the sex that they had&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/trump-hush-money-trial-stormy-daniels-testimony-00156744&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68460000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68460001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">described in some detail the sex that they had</a>. Trump defense attorney Susan Necheles also brought up some of Daniels’ former public insults directed towards Trump, sure to make the former president’s blood boil, including “<a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/07/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/daniels-spars-with-necheles-00156649" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;I don’t owe him shit and I’ll never give that orange turd a dime&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/07/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/daniels-spars-with-necheles-00156649&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68460002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68460003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">I don’t owe him shit and I’ll never give that orange turd a dime</a>.”</p><p>While sitting through testimony from Daniels that sounded at times designed to humiliate him — Necheles at one point brought up Daniels’ comments that when she saw Trump in his underwear she almost fainted — Trump was visibly huffing and puffing, shaking his head, and shifting in his seat. At one point, he <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/07/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/trump-appears-upset-00156516" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;seemed to mouth “bullshit,”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/07/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/trump-appears-upset-00156516&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68460004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68460005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">seemed to mouth “bullshit,”</a> behavior demonstrable enough that Merchan <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/09/trump-stormy-daniels-trial-testimony-00157192" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;instructed his lawyers to get him to cool off&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/09/trump-stormy-daniels-trial-testimony-00157192&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68470000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68470001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">instructed his lawyers to get him to cool off</a>.</p><p>That request might be categorically impossible to fulfill. Since he burst onto the political scene, Trump’s appeal to Republicans was precisely his attack dog mentality — leave no slight unpunished, no rival unbruised, and always exact revenge. In his 2007 book “Think Big,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/330325949847597056" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;explained his first rule of business&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/330325949847597056&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68470002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68470003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">explained his first rule of business</a>: “Always get even. When you are in business, you need to get even with people who screw you.”</p><p>Charting his political career, it’s easy to see that mentality playing out in real time. He’s purged the Republican Party of his detractors, insulted and disparaged his skeptics, and driven out of office some of the GOP’s most prominent politicians. Of the ten House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after Jan. 6, only two remain in Congress — in no small part due to his efforts.</p><p>Trump’s scorched earth strategy has made him one of the most polarizing presidents ever to hold office, but it’s also propelled the unshakable loyalty that many of his supporters have for him. In court this week, however, his political superpower — the willingness to launch shock-and-awe, no-holds-barred personal attacks on his foes — was neutralized.</p><p>He’s been forced to rely on surrogates without the charisma or the killer instinct to deliver his message.</p><p>“What’s happening in this courtroom is clearly criminal. It’s being led by political thugs,” Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/09/rick-scott-trump-trial-00157193" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;put it in an appearance outside the Manhattan courtroom&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/09/rick-scott-trump-trial-00157193&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68470004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68470005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">put it in an appearance outside the Manhattan courtroom</a> on Thursday.</p><p>While Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112413468421713732" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;shared some of Scott’s comments on Truth Social&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112413468421713732&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68470006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68470007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">shared some of Scott’s comments on Truth Social</a>, he notably didn’t include the point he wanted to convey the most — his belief about the criminality of the trial, as that would have been a violation of his gag order.</p><p>Merchan’s crackdown this week has put Trump in a position with which he’s never before had to contend — even visible fuming in his chair can rise to the level of contempt, as the judge reminded Trump and his lawyers in the midst of Daniels’ testimony on Tuesday. When the adult film star returned to court on Thursday, Trump was a bit more cowed. At some point, soon, though, he might no longer be able to contain his frustration.</p><p>Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said Friday that <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/10/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/judge-wants-cohen-to-stop-talking-00157362" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;there are likely only two witnesses remaining in the prosecution’s case-in-chief&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/10/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/judge-wants-cohen-to-stop-talking-00157362&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68470008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68470009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">there are likely only two witnesses remaining in the prosecution’s case-in-chief</a>. “It’s entirely possible that we will rest by the end of next week,” Steinglass said.</p><p>Even so, it’s a week that’s likely to test Trump like no other. One of those witnesses, currently likely to appear on Monday, is Michael Cohen, who is both the key witness in the prosecution’s case and Trump’s old fixer-turned-foe.</p><p>Once an instrument of Trump’s fury, Cohen’s break with Trump is so complete that Merchan has had to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/10/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/judge-wants-cohen-to-stop-talking-00157362" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;instruct prosecutors to get Cohen to stop discussing the case on TikTok&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/10/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/judge-wants-cohen-to-stop-talking-00157362&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d6847000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d6847000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">instruct prosecutors to get Cohen to stop discussing the case on TikTok</a>.</p><p>Trump’s animosity toward his former associate is by now well-known. In early April, Trump called Cohen and Daniels “two sleaze bags who have, with their lies and misrepresentations, cost our Country dearly!” That’s just the latest of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1SC0TK/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;many insults that Trump has thrown at Cohen since 2018&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1SC0TK/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d6847000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d6847000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">many insults that Trump has thrown at Cohen since 2018</a>, when Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance crimes related to Trump.</p><p>And Cohen has fired right back, calling Trump “VonShitzInPantz” on X (formerly Twitter), a nickname that <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/michael-cohens-tweets-mocking-donald-215756479.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Trump attorney Todd Blanche read aloud in court&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/news/michael-cohens-tweets-mocking-donald-215756479.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d6847000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d6847000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Trump attorney Todd Blanche read aloud in court</a> to complain about Cohen’s social media activity.</p><p>Trump’s legal case rests on his lawyers’ ability to discredit Cohen’s testimony, in what is sure to be a fiery cross-examination. In the near term, though, thanks to Merchan’s gag order, Trump’s ability to stay out of jail may rest on whether he can continue to suppress his natural instincts to attack. It won’t come easily.</p><p><i>This article first appeared in POLITICO Nightly. </i></p>]]></content:encoded>

Not on social media, where she’s quick to clap back at ugly memes and derogatory jabs. And not in a courtroom, where, on a witness stand in Donald Trump’s hush money trial this week, she proudly described her pornography career, defended herself from charges of money-grubbing and deflected criticism of a strip club tour called “Make America Horny Again.”</p><p>Sex scandals have come a long way since the Bill Clinton days.</p><p>That’s a major takeaway from this week’s courtroom spectacle, when Daniels calmly testified about hotel room dalliances and sexual positions and the clumsy come-ons from a future U.S. president — and the media took copious notes. In some ways, the excitement around the trial was a throwback to the political and legal scandals of the 1990s, when Clinton’s alleged sexual harassment and illicit affairs led to lawsuits, investigations and impeachment. Then, as now, there was breathless interest from the press, aw-shucks reporting of salacious details, palpable glee from late-night comedians.</p><p>But there’s also a crucial difference. The women at the center of the 1990s scandals, Paula Jones, who sued Clinton for sexual harassment in the mid-1990s, and Monica Lewinsky, the intern at the center of Clinton’s impeachment, were mocked and belittled, frequently dismissed, dragged unwittingly into the arena and left to suffer there alone. At one memorable point in the saga, Jones broke down crying at a press conference; the spotlight was too harsh, the pressure was too much.</p><p>At Trump’s trial, it was his longtime aide Hope Hicks who sobbed under pressure on the witness stand. Daniels, the woman with the bedroom stories, seemed unfazed. That says something about her own personality: confident, defiant, sex-positive. But it also says something about a culture that gives her more freedom to present herself that way — and the tools to push back at her detractors.</p><p>Anyone who lived through the Clinton scandals remembers the deep unkindness to the women at their center, and the power dynamics that made the cruelty possible. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB899939190484772500" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;A 1998&#xa0;&lt;i>Wall Street Journal&lt;/i>&#xa0;editorial called Lewinsky a “little tart.”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB899939190484772500&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d684c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d684c0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">A 1998&#xa0;<i>Wall Street Journal</i>&#xa0;editorial called Lewinsky a “little tart.”</a> Men with late-night television megaphones mocked Lewinsky’s weight and Jones’ nose. Men at the center of politics made dismissive statements that revealed as much class snobbery as misogyny: James Carville famously said of Jones, “Drag a hundred-dollar bill through a trailer park, you never know what you’ll find.”</p><p>Today, Trump’s defense attorneys are using the same playbook to try to neutralize Daniels’ testimony, arguing that she was an unsavory character, looking for extortion money, when she took a $130,000 payment for hiding her story. But Daniels cuts a decidedly different figure. She’s older, for one, and battle-tested. But she’s also far less capable of being shamed. Her long career in the adult film industry, where she rose from actress to director and impresario, inoculates her from much of the knee-jerk derision. It also gives her a sense of agency that Lewinsky and Jones never had, and the freedom to push back at old slut-shaming tropes. In the courtroom on Thursday, when Trump’s defense attorney took a backhanded jab at Daniels’ career —"So you have a lot of experience making phony stories about sex appear real?" — Daniels had a quick, unbothered reply. “The sex is real,” she said. "That's why it’s pornography."<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352362261112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>That perfunctory defiance helps explain why, while Daniels has been at center of late-night jokes this week, she’s seldom been the butt of them. On “The Daily Show,” host Jordan Klepper focused on Trump himself and the media’s oddball fascination: “You’re very prudish for people whose names sound like porn names,” he said, after playing a clip of CNN’s Dana Bash and Jake Tapper, acting like the trial coverage made them squeamish. On ABC, Jimmy Kimmel focused on the circus itself: “The judge said Stormy could testify about her sexual relationship with Trump, but also said, ‘We don’t need to know the details.’ … Yes, we do need to know the details. Some of us are trying to host a show here, OK?” (Daniels’ Thursday testimony about a paranormal reality show and a supposedly-haunted house that was actually occupied by a possum might provide a <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/weird/paranormal-possum-cnns-entire-coverage-team-wheezes-with-laughter-at-bizarre-turn-in-trump-stormy-daniels-cross/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;fresh round of fodder&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.mediaite.com/weird/paranormal-possum-cnns-entire-coverage-team-wheezes-with-laughter-at-bizarre-turn-in-trump-stormy-daniels-cross/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d684d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d684d0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">fresh round of fodder</a>, but it won’t be about sex.)</p><p>It's fair to wonder whether the mainstream media would be so credulous of Daniels, or so relatively kind, if someone other than Trump were on trial. Indeed, some of Trump’s right-wing media defenders have been less hesitant to challenge Daniels’ credibility. On Fox News this week, the female host Kennedy made an old-school jab: “Her being surprised that she was going to a hotel room alone with a man to have body congress is like Pete Sampras being surprised at being invited to a tennis court and you want to see his serve.”</p><p>Still, it’s clear that, for many outlets, the ground rules around covering sexual dynamics have changed. The #MeToo scandal shone a light on power differentials and forced some revisionist thinking in the media and beyond — creating possibilities that never existed in the 1990s, says <a href="https://www.leoratanenbaum.com/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715300046493,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715300046493,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.leoratanenbaum.com/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fd9-dcc8-addf-dfdf7dc50001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Leora Tanenbaum&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fd9-dcc8-addf-dfdf7dc50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Leora Tanenbaum</a>, an expert on slut-shaming whose books include “SLUT! Growing up Female with a Bad Reputation.”</p><p>Back then, “we didn’t even have the language to describe being trashed as a result of the sexual double standard,” Tanenbaum wrote in an email. “It was normalized to hold the mindset that boys will be boys — and girls will be sluts. As a result, there’s nothing these women could have done differently at the time to be taken seriously.”<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352592873112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>This shift has no doubt been aided by other changes in the past few decades — for one, social media. It takes a fair amount of fortitude to play in an arena where body-shaming and generalized cruelty are still the standard currency, but Daniels uses her accounts with confidence, honing her straight-shooting persona and pushing back at critics who want to reduce her to sexist tropes. When someone recently wrote on X, “it’s crazy your greatest life achievement is fornication with a married man,” <a href="https://twitter.com/StormyDaniels/status/1778835726513102990" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Daniels shot back&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/StormyDaniels/status/1778835726513102990&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d684d0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d684d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Daniels shot back</a>, “True! He was married to me and the achievement is our daughter.” If Jones and Lewinsky had had the power to correct rumors in real time, and speak in their own voices, one wonders how different the ’90s would have been.</p><p>Still, Tanenbaum cautions against claiming too much progress. There’s still a double standard, she contends, when it comes to women talking about sex: When Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion performed their explicit song “WAP” at the 2021 Grammy Awards, the Federal Communications Commission received over 1,000 complaints. And Tanenbaum takes issue with the media for always identifying Daniels as a “porn star” or “adult film actress,” which she says conditions readers to think she can’t be taken seriously. “Her profession is not relevant at all to this criminal trial unless you believe that women who work in the sex industry are untrustworthy,” Tanenbaum says.</p><p>But there are signs that, as it works through every angle of the Trump trial story, the press is treating adult film workers with a newfound respect. On CNN on Tuesday, Tapper conducted a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/justice/2024/05/08/the-lead-alana-evans-stormy-daniels-testimony-trump-trial-jake-tapper.cnn" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;strikingly conventional interview&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/justice/2024/05/08/the-lead-alana-evans-stormy-daniels-testimony-trump-trial-jake-tapper.cnn&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d684d0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d684d0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">strikingly conventional interview</a> with another porn actress, Alana Evans, who had been at Lake Tahoe around the time of Daniels’ first encounter with Trump. There was no indication that it was anything but an ordinary chat with an ordinary cable news guest.</p><p>More broadly, in the political world, people from unlikely corners are starting to push back against the stigmas around women and sex. Last winter, freshman U.S. Rep.

She said she might run for office again.</p><p>Lewinsky herself has capitalized on the media and cultural reckoning to present new sides of herself, penning <i>Vanity Fair</i> essays, advising a TV series on the Clinton scandal and positioning herself as an expert on bullying. On social media, she’s both playful and pointed about the past, jumping on <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/4620717-monica-lewinsky-joins-in-on-taylor-swift-viral-asylum-meme-with-white-house-image/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715300156166,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715300156166,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/4620717-monica-lewinsky-joins-in-on-taylor-swift-viral-asylum-meme-with-white-house-image/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fdb-daad-a98f-7fdf34b70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Taylor Swift memes&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fdb-daad-a98f-7fdf34b60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Taylor Swift memes</a> to make digs at her old tormentors.</p><p>Her rehabilitation is, by now, a given.

If Stormy Daniels’ testimony serves her well — in the court of public opinion, if not the court of law — it will be a sign of how much the dynamics have changed. It’s easy to wallow in the salacious of details of a TV-worthy scandal. But just because it’s entertaining doesn’t mean it’s all a joke.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Then came the prosecutors’ most notable and attention-grabbing witness to date — the former adult film star <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/stormy-daniels-testify-trump-trial-00156522" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Stormy Daniels&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/stormy-daniels-testify-trump-trial-00156522&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68590002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68590003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Stormy Daniels</a>. It was a remarkable and distinctly awkward affair for the former president, who sat through hours of detailed and embarrassing testimony about their alleged extramarital sexual relationship.</p><p>But thanks to the absence of cameras in the courtroom — and despite the wall-to-wall coverage — there’s much that remains unclear to those of us on the outside, regarding Daniels and much else. So we convened the second in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/25/trump-trial-politico-reporter-conversation-00153671" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a series of roundtable&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/25/trump-trial-politico-reporter-conversation-00153671&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68590005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68590006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a series of roundtable</a> discussions with a group of POLITICO’s legal and political reporters to take readers behind the scenes of the courtroom and the Trump campaign.</p><p>We were joined by Ben Feuerherd, who has been in the courtroom and in the courthouse every day of the trial covering this historic proceeding; Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney, who have been closely following and reporting on Trump’s legal travails for years; and Meridith McGraw, who has been covering the Trump reelection campaign while the candidate spends four days a week on trial in a Manhattan courtroom.</p><p>With the trial roughly halfway through, it was also an opportunity to discuss some surprising turns, including where the prosecution and the defense may have scored some real points before the jury.</p><p><i>This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p><br /><p><b>Ben, Stormy Daniels took the stand on Tuesday and will appear again on Thursday. The timing of her testimony was a surprise to those of us on the outside. What was the scene like in the courtroom and the courthouse when this news started to make the rounds?</b></p><p><b>Feuerherd: </b>To start the day, things were at a fever pitch, because Monday left off with Trump in the hallway basically saying, “I’ll go to jail. I’ll violate the gag order.” Then before he even arrived at court, he sent a message on Truth Social that appeared to address a witness taking the stand. I was waiting: “Could this be the day where Trump walks out in the hallway and breaks the gag order to put the ball in the judge’s court?”</p><p>All the drama on Tuesday was in the courtroom, not outside the courtroom. It was a stark difference from Monday, where the testimony was kind of dry yet important to the prosecution, but all the drama was seemingly playing outside with Trump’s comments about the gag order.</p><p><b>Josh, you were in the courtroom Tuesday. Can you just talk about what the reaction was among the jurors during Daniels’ testimony? You reported that at least one juror put her hand to her head and looked away. Can you talk a little bit about that, and what you saw from the whole panel of jurors? &#xa0;</b></p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>As Ben mentioned, on Monday, they seemed kind of bored. I think anybody would be by the time you’re going through the ninth, 10th or 11th monthly invoice for some kind of payment. The witnesses that they had on Monday were not the most electric ones you’re ever going to see on the witness stand. Bookkeepers and corporate controllers don’t tend to really color outside the lines, so people looked a little bit bored, which is not to say they weren’t paying attention. I’ve covered a lot of trials, and when jurors are not paying attention or actually nodding off, you see that, and that wasn’t happening, although some of them were staring around looking out at the gallery and the press corps.</p><br /><p>As we moved into Tuesday, after Stormy Daniels had come in and taken the stand, which was a dramatic entry — not that anything that exciting or flashy happened — they were really, really focused on her, and I think the jurors understood that she’s sort of the central figure of the case, at least in the pop culture assessment of it. I’m not sure that she’s the central figure in that case legally.</p><p>She’s become a larger-than-life figure, and I think people treated her that way. The thing you’re alluding to — I think it wasn’t that people were uncomfortable through the entire testimony, but it was certain details that she shared at different points about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump that got into some of the nitty gritty that the judge later said, “You know, I think some things were probably said that didn’t need to be said.”</p><p>That was when I saw some jurors kind of cringing or smiling a little bit awkwardly — and one kind of looking away and put her hand on her forehead — so there was some discomfort with some of the more tawdry aspects. If anybody was dozing off during that particular exchange, they would have been quickly woken because there was a flurry of action back and forth, as Trump’s lawyers naturally objected to many of those things being put on the record in this trial.</p><p><b>What was it that exactly frustrated the judge? There were a couple of lines in Daniels’ testimony that implied that their encounter may not have been consensual, when she said she blacked out. Ironically, that testimony or that allusion is much more prejudicial against Trump than the normal defendant because he has actually </b><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/05/09/verdict-trump-sexual-assault-trial-00096039" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;b>sexually abused women in non-consensual ways&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/05/09/verdict-trump-sexual-assault-trial-00096039&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68590007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68590008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>sexually abused women in non-consensual ways</b></a><b> before, so I get the judge’s concern on that front.</b></p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>The judge didn’t really explain that, but I think going into the hearing, he had made clear that he didn’t think that there needed to be a lot of detail provided. The facts that came out — at one point, she said, “This was missionary position,” or there was a question about whether he used a condom and things like that.</p><p>Now, these are things that she has already talked about in interviews. For goodness sake, she wrote a book about it, right? So this stuff is out there, but to have her say it in Trump’s physical presence was obviously a new thing.</p><p>I think the thing you mentioned, Ankush, was a big part of it. This notion that the sex might have not been consensual.</p><p>She has been pretty clear in her previous accounts. Some people have said, “Oh, it sounds like you were date raped, or sexually assaulted by Trump.” And I know of previous interviews where Daniels said, “I’m not saying that that’s what happened.” It may have just been her nervousness and word choice going from saying, “I don’t have a clear memory of everything that happened that night” versus saying, “I blacked out,” which then you start thinking, you know, is this a Bill Cosby kind of thing?</p><p><b>Well, you also might start thinking, “Is it a Donald Trump thing?”</b></p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>That’s a problem. I do also think the judge felt that while it was OK to talk about the encounter, that this really should not be a trial about that encounter. It’s not a sexual assault trial. It’s a trial about something else.</p><p>I think you can actually argue that it shouldn’t matter much for the outcome of his case whether this event happened the way Stormy Daniels described it or not, or to some extent whether it may not have happened at all. I don’t really quite see how that figures entirely into the merits of the case.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Can I offer you my own two cents on that? There is definitely a way that the prosecutors could have put on this case without having to take a position on whether this encounter actually happened, but there are several problems with that.</b></p><p><b>First, Trump has denied it repeatedly for years, and Trump’s lawyer repeated the denial in his opening statement, so if you’re the prosecutors, and this is part of the story, you absolutely have to prove that it happened, including by having the only other person in the room provide as much detail as possible to shore up their credibility.</b></p><p><b>Also, we’re hearing a lot of pro-Trump spin on Daniels’ testimony — about how it was a disaster, she was irrelevant or whatever. Trump could have preempted this witness — possibly entirely — if he just admitted that the encounter had happened. Smart criminal defenses do sometimes concede unpleasant facts in order to get the jury to focus on the material ones that might actually get the defendant off. Trump himself played an essential role in bringing her to the stand.</b></p><p><b>All that said, what is Trump doing through all of this? What is he physically doing during this very strange testimony?</b></p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>I’ll tell you what I could see, and then Ben can chime in.</p><p>I could see that he wasn’t really looking at Daniels. The way the courtroom is constructed, it’s a little bit odd. I think it’s a bit hard to see the person in the witness box and on the witness stand from the defendant’s table, at least where Trump is sitting. The judge’s bench is kind of in the way.</p><p>There was one moment during the Tuesday proceedings where the prosecutors asked, kind of dramatically, for Daniels to identify Trump, and she had to lean around the judge’s bench and crane her neck a bit and then, you know, pointed at him. Obviously, she had seen him coming into the courtroom; she knew he was there. But she had to do that.</p><p>Trump was making a deliberate effort to not acknowledge her in the courtroom and stare straight ahead. He had the opportunity to see her because there’s a couple different TV monitors that are on the counsel table and elsewhere in the courtroom, so it’s not like he couldn’t see or hear.</p><p>And he had trouble controlling his reactions. There were different times when he started shifting around and seemed to be mumbling, and the judge eventually called him out for that, at least privately.</p><p><b>Feuerherd: </b>The one main thing that I saw and that we’ve reported is that when Daniels was describing rolling up his magazine swatting him on the backside with it, Trump sort of laid back in his chair, and I saw in the feed that he mouthed, “Bullshit.”</p><p>It was later raised at sidebar. The judge talked to Todd Blanche, Trump’s attorney, and said, “Your client is audibly cursing, and that’s contemptuous, and I’m not gonna stand for it.</p><p><b>Meridith, this is now like the third trial in a year in which Trump’s mistreatment of women is really at the heart of the case. We had two E. Jean Carroll trials where he was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation to the tune of nearly $100 million. That was nonconsensual, so there’s a big distinction there.</b></p><p><b>But now we have Trump cheating on his wife with an adult film star. Has any of this dented Trump’s standing with women voters heading into this election?</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>Trump has always had a women problem. We saw that in 2016. He made slight improvements in 2020 with women voters, but there still really is a big gender gap between Trump and President Biden when it comes to women voters. A lot of that has to do with reproductive rights and abortion, which continue to be top of mind for a lot of those more moderate women who might be trying to decide who they’re going to vote for in the upcoming election.</p><p>Some of the suburban women that Trump really has struggled with in the past, when it comes to the E. Jean Carroll case, at least among Republican voters, I don’t think it’s made a huge difference. I think a lot of them have been able to grapple with Trump and his personal issues, warts and all.</p><p>Still, when it comes to Trump’s issue with women in the upcoming election, this does not help.</p><p>You heard Hope Hicks, when she was on the witness stand, say that she didn’t think about the Stormy Daniels issue hurting with women in 2016, but she did think that it could hurt with voters after the fact. So I do think it could be one of many issues that Trump has with women in 2024.</p><p><b>Where is Melania in all of this? She’s been keeping a low profile, but ideally, I would think if you’re running for reelection, your wife — the former first lady — would be a prominent surrogate.</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>Melania continues to be a mystery. Nobody is ever really quite sure how she spends her day. She’s incredibly private and spends a lot of time with her family. Her mother recently died, and Barron Trump is going to be heading off to college.</p><p>We’ve heard from some of her former aides about how she might be taking this. She’s probably watching all of this incredibly closely. The Stormy Daniels affair allegations really bothered her. Obviously, it came right after she gave birth to her son, Barron.<br /></p><br /><p>She’s probably following along with all of this. We’ve only seen her come out on the campaign trail — oh, gosh, the last public appearance she had was at a Log Cabin Republicans event, but it was incredibly small. The campaign has said that we’re going to be seeing more of her at some point, but right now, with the Stormy Daniels headlines, I’m not sure if that’s going to be anytime soon.</p><p><b>Does she believe that this sexual encounter with Daniels happened, or does she have the view that Daniels is making it up?</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>One of her former aides said that Melania Trump is always about the proof, wanting to have ironclad proof for things. She really is a lot like her husband in that she is skeptical and dismissive of the media and critics and anybody who undermines them.</p><p>At the same time, Trump has a longstanding reputation with women that I’m sure Melania Trump is well aware of.</p><p><b>Kyle, the contempt proceedings were another big event this week.

It’s not the first time he’s violated a gag order in one of his legal cases. Do you think he really cannot help himself? Or does he think that this is helpful to him as some sort of legal strategy or political strategy or both?</b></p><p><b>Cheney: </b>I actually think he can help himself. It’s actually a salient point, because when he goes out into the hallway for interviews, he sort of knows where the line is and is strategic about what he says. In many of his social media posts — even the ones that crossed the line — you can sort of see at least some semblance of an effort to find the contours of the gag order and push right up to the limit.</p><p>At times, he clearly has exceeded that limit when he talks about witnesses. And some of them were reposts of others’ posts, which is kind of a novel legal issue. Even Justice Merchan has had to say that this is the first time this has ever been ruled on, but I’m ruling against you.</p><p>So I think he knows the line, and that is salient, because, as Judge Chutkan has said in D.C., he knows exactly how to restrain himself when he’s told to. The gag order actually works in that he doesn’t say things that go so far over the line, but obviously he has trouble finding exactly where that line is.</p><p>I also think that Trump — in a very deep psychological way — does not want to go to jail, even though he thinks it would be a political windfall for him. Also, personally he doesn’t want to be in prison. So I think that he’s of two minds on that, knowing what the good politics is versus his own personal well-being.</p><p><b>McGraw: </b>At the psychological level, he does not want to go to jail. That’s been a fear of his, as Kyle was saying. He does these verbal gymnastics to push him right up against the edge, and the threat of jail is potent enough of a political threat that he hangs over his supporters.</p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>I think he doesn’t want to go. You’ve got to remember, at least before he ran for the presidency, this is a guy whose whole brand is creature comforts. He’s the epitome of what we used to call in the 1980s “champagne wishes and caviar dreams.” He’s not someone who’s going to find himself in jail being very tolerant in those kinds of conditions when he’s used to the more gilded surroundings that he prefers at Trump Tower, down at Mar-a-Lago and so forth.</p><p><b>Cheney: </b>He wants everyone to think that he’s willing to go to jail.</p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>I totally agree with Kyle. He revels in his tough guy image — you know, “This isn’t about me, this is about you, and if I have to take one for the country, I’m going to do that.”</p><p><b>Cheney: </b>Right before we jumped on here, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/trumptweets/comments/1cn39x3/5824_my_free_speech_was_taken_away_its_so_unfair/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;he posted something&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/trumptweets/comments/1cn39x3/5824_my_free_speech_was_taken_away_its_so_unfair/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d685a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d685a0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">he posted something</a> saying “give me liberty or give me death” in the context of his gag order, his willingness to defend free speech. He certainly wants the impression out there even though I think he would fight tooth and nail to stay out of prison.</p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>The other thing I would say on that is that we can all think of things he could say that would violate the gag order and land him in jail. As Kyle has been alluding to, he hasn’t said those things yet. That makes me doubt that he’s someone who’s actually eager to spend time behind bars to become a martyr for his cause.</p><p><b>McGraw: </b>He’s a notorious germophobe, too.</p><p><b>Cheney: </b>That’s the psychological part. Exactly.</p><p><b>There’s no hair and makeup in jail, either.</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>No hair and makeup. He can’t control it.</p><p><b>Cheney:</b> Has to wear a jumpsuit.</p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>The coiffe was a little off, by the way, in court this week, since I had a lot of time to look at the back of his head. There was an over-extension on the left side that just was not symmetrical, and I was surprised that that went on for so long.</p><p><b>Feuerherd: </b>We gave him every opportunity to break the gag order — questions that, had he responded to them, arguably he would have broken the gag order. He steered clear of every one of those, but then at the end of the day, he said, “I’m ready to go to jail for the Constitution,” and yet did not respond to any questions that could have broken the gag order.</p><p><b>You know how I know he doesn’t want to go to jail? Josh is right, but a much more simple and efficient way to go to jail if he really meant it would just be to repost the Truth Social posts that got him held in contempt the first time. That’d be quick, easy and clearly in violation of the gag order, and the judge would be angry and would send him to jail. Trump isn’t doing that, which is why I know he doesn’t actually want to go to jail, at least not now.</b></p><p><b>Ben, we’re about halfway through the trial. You have been there every day. Can you talk about where you have seen successes for the prosecution and also for the defense?</b></p><p><b>Feuerherd: </b>The high point for the prosecution probably would have been [former National Enquirer publisher] David Pecker, just laying this foundation for this conspiracy that they allege in a very clear, concise way, discussing meetings in Trump Tower with Michael Cohen and Trump and then walking jurors through the end result of that, which was AMI entering into a non-prosecution agreement that said they broke campaign finance laws. He said, “I thought I was working for the campaign, not to protect Donald Trump’s name.”</p><p>You can make an argument that, for the defense, Hope Hicks painted Trump in a favorable light. She arguably scored some points for prosecutors, but also tried to protect Trump, dirtied Michael Cohen a little bit.</p><p><b>Cheney: </b>That speaks to this this [Harvey] Weinstein issue. His conviction was overturned in part because there was extraneous stuff that was introduced that was prejudicial to the case. There’s certainly not a parallel between these two cases, but you could see the contours of a similar argument here — that it was all this really prejudicial stuff that came in that had nothing to do with the underlying charges. Trump’s at least going to make a run at that if he is convicted.</p><p><b>Meredith, let’s talk about the political theater in the courtroom.</b></p><p><b>Ken Paxton showed up even though he has a full time job in Texas as attorney general. We’ve also had these political people who weren’t there initially but have shown up in the last week or two — Susie Wiles, Boris Epshteyn, Natalie Harp. What should we make of the fact that these political allies are showing up? Are they there to give him an ego boost?</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>I will say with Ken Paxton, he has shown up at all sorts of different Trump events I’ve been at. I think he is often very eager to show Trump just how loyal and with him he is. I have no doubt that that was the calculation with him.</p><p>The other names that you just gave — Susie Wiles, Boris, Natalie Harp, that’s really Trump’s inner circle. These are his top advisers — people who spend a lot of time with him every day — and this trial is a big part of his campaign message. They obviously don’t love the fact that Trump is spending all of his time in court and that this is what people are talking about in the election, but they’ve still tried to say that they’re making lemonade out of lemons with this and really trying to push this as part of their argument that Trump is somehow unfairly targeted.<br /></p><br /><p><br />But there is, of course, just an awareness that this is where we’re at in 2024. This is what the cards are that they’re having to deal with. Politically, they’re having to make this part of their case, whether they want to or not.</p><p><b>Cheney: </b>I actually think that it’s a little surprising there haven’t been more people showing up like Ken Paxton. I think Marjorie Taylor Greene showed up for some of the pretrial stuff.</p><p>Trump values loyalty maybe as his No. 1 attribute, and there’s no better way to show your loyalty than to stand with him in this moment. And yet, as I said, the people who are there — there’s his campaign apparatus, there’s his message apparatus, they would be expected to be with him anyway. It took a while even <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/06/trump-trial-new-york-melania-family-00156189" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;before his own family members&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/06/trump-trial-new-york-melania-family-00156189&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d685a0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d685a0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">before his own family members</a> showed up.</p><p><b>Meridith, is this trial taking a personal toll on Trump? To my eyes, it does look like he’s a little slumped down in his appearances, even when he’s in front of a camera — not just the pictures and the reporting from within the courtroom.</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>This is — especially Daniels’ testimony — it’s just been embarrassing for him to have all of these personal details out there even though he’s denied it.</p><p>I’m sure these are humiliating details to have talked about every day on the news. His people close to him have said that this is a kind of punishment for him in and of itself — that he obviously is not enjoying any of this. They’ve tried to make a political spectacle out of it, and they’ve tried to have these political events on the sidelines. He’s had sort of spirit-boosting events back at Mar-a-Lago where he’s been surrounded by allies, like when he was at Ronny Jackson’s birthday party this weekend.</p><p>But being in trial, day after day, I’m sure is grueling and taxing. And you see, like you said, physically how it’s impacted him.</p><p><br /></p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

Foreign policy was on the agenda, and the Ford team saw a major opportunity to brush back the former Georgia peanut farmer.</p><p>The biggest issue of the day was the Helsinki Accords, which cemented the post-World War II borders and were intended to ease tensions with the Soviet Union. Ford had come in for criticism that he had ceded too much to the Soviets and was ready when one of the moderators, the<i> New York Times’</i> Max Frankel, raised the charge.</p><p>The Pope endorsed Helsinki, Ford responded (in a bow to the campaign’s conviction that the Catholic vote was key). The whole of the West was behind it. And then, in a rhetorical flourish, he added: “There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration.”</p><p>The Ford campaign staff collectively blanched — National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft literally turned white — but Frankel threw the president a potential lifeline. “Did I understand you to say, sir, that the Russians are not using Eastern Europe as their own sphere of influence in occupying most of the countries there…?”</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/4d/ad/80abfdda4cf6a5a76884247f3717/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary1.jpg" /><br /><p>After asserting, correctly, that Yugoslavia and Romania did not consider themselves dominated, he added, “I don’t believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.” That was a bridge too far — a comment that made the president look delusional and soured key voters in communities filled with Europeans whose families had fled Soviet brutality.</p><p>It was a debate gaffe that arguably cost Ford the election and changed American history. Indeed, not only would there have been no President Jimmy Carter, there might have been no President Ronald Reagan or the conservative revolution he unleashed.</p><p><br /></p><br /><p><b>How did the election</b> get to that point, where such a misstep could tip the balance? Blame Watergate. The candidates might have bristled at the description, but the 1976 presidential campaign was arguably a race between two accidental nominees, both shaped by the fallout from Richard Nixon’s downfall.</p><p>When Ford became president on Aug. 8, 1974, after Nixon resigned, he had never been elected to national or even statewide office. He was the well-liked minority leader of the House when Nixon picked him to replace Spiro Agnew, who’d resigned from the vice presidency one step ahead of the sheriff. The House and Senate confirmed the choice, but the only voters who’d ever chosen him were those of his Grand Rapids, Michigan, congressional district.</p><p>Still, he’d entered the presidency on a wave of good feeling — exuding modesty (“I’m a Ford, not a Lincoln”), fixing his own breakfast and promising cooperation with the big Democratic majorities in Congress. Then things went sideways when he pardoned Nixon in an effort to spare the nation the prospect of an ex-president on trial. His press secretary resigned, his approval ratings sank and then came the more personal assaults. After a few spills, the most athletic president in history — he’d been offered a pro football contract — was portrayed as a bumbling fool, especially on a new late night TV show, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bvxZgCryUE" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;“Saturday Night Live.”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bvxZgCryUE&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d686b0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d686b0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">“Saturday Night Live.”</a> The cover of New York Magazine <a href="https://nymag.com/news/politics/46799/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;portrayed him, literally, as a clown&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nymag.com/news/politics/46799/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d686b0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d686b0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">portrayed him, literally, as a clown</a>.</p><p>More importantly, oil price hikes imposed by the OPEC cartel led to rising inflation and painful contractions in the auto industry, as customers sought out more fuel-efficient cars from Japan and Europe. The Ford administration’s lame PR effort — “a Whip Inflation Now” campaign — was met with ridicule. Then came the word from California: Former Gov. Ronald Reagan was going to challenge Ford for the Republican nomination, and Reagan ultimately came within a whisper of making Ford the first president since Chester Arthur to be denied his party’s nomination. When Ford invited Reagan to speak to the convention after his acceptance speech, it was clear who had the firmer grip on the heart and soul of the party.</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/7d/c6/1f85ce454f68ae676394852d2485/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary2.png" /><br /><p>It was Watergate that made Jimmy Carter, that most unlikely of candidates, the nominee of his party as well. Under ordinary circumstances, a former one-term governor from a Southern state who could go unrecognized by 9 out of 10 citizens would be laughed off the political stage (When he announced for president, his hometown paper headlined: “Jimmy Who Is Running for What!?”)</p><p>But after Nixon’s scandal, Carter’s bugs turned out to be features.</p><p>“I’m not from Washington,” he’d proclaimed. For the last four campaigns, every Democratic nominee for president and vice president was or had been a senator. But in this year, to be from somewhere else was to be free from the taint of scandal. (Reagan had the same advantage). Moreover, he was, in demeanor and background, without any trace of privilege or power: a peanut farmer from the ridiculously on-the-mark town of… Plains.</p><p>His campaign had no money, so he stayed at the homes of supporters, carrying his own bags, traveling with an entourage of two. His campaign themes were intensely personal: “I’ll never lie to you,” said the man who called for “a government as good as its people.”</p><p>After the party’s internecine blood baths of 1968 and 1972, Democrats had united, with everyone from Black politicians like Julian Bond and Rep. Andrew Young to the one-time segregationist George Wallace backing him. When the conventions were over, Carter had a 33-point lead over Ford. No wonder the sitting president, in a break with precedent, challenged his rival to debate.</p><p>One of the Ford campaign’s overriding goals was to turn Carter’s sudden emergence from obscurity into a liability, by asking again and again: “Do you really know what he believes in?” As attacks go, it was mild fare. (It was in fact a highly civil campaign, in which the charges of inconsistency were met by Carter calling Ford “a good and decent man” who had not accomplished anything of note in his tenure, though that did not stop journalist Barbara Walters from asking the candidates about “the low moral tone of the campaign.”)</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/0e/c4/947c87cc4c838929d29edd5db885/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary3.jpg" /><br /><p>But the argument began to cut, and at that first debate, Ford’s critique of an inconsistent, vague candidate hit home; when the two met for their second debate at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, Carter’s lead had dropped to single digits.</p><p>And then Ford stepped in it with his flippant remark about Poland and the Soviet Union.</p><p>In that pre-social media era, the backlash built over a couple days until the outrage was widespread, particularly among families of immigrants who loathed the Soviets.</p><p>It took a week for Ford to find his footing on the matter, including by offering an apologetic call to Aloysius Mazewski, president of the Polish‐American Congress — a week that broke the steady improvement in the campaign’s standing.</p><p>How critical was this setback? As Ford pollster Bob Teeter later said, “The controversy used up valuable campaign days when there were all too few left, when a steady climb had to be sustained.”</p><p>Even if it had a marginal impact, that margin would have been enough to change the outcome. Look at the results. Carter beat Ford by 1.7 million popular votes, but the Electoral College couldn’t have been closer.</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/26/e3/7f3a33e1466f9c7d20464ad3429a/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary4.jpg" /><br /><p>In Ohio, with 25 electoral votes — where the families of Catholic immigrants from Eastern Europe formed a significant share of the vote — Carter beat Ford by just 11,000 votes, a third of a percent of the 4 million votes cast. If 6,000 Ohio voters had changed their decision, along with 7,500 Mississippians, Ford would have remained in the White House. It was the narrowest victory in a hundred years, and nothing since has been closer except the 2000 election.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Had Ford held on</b> to the presidency, it would have changed the trajectory of American politics — potentially by denying Reagan his time in the White House.</p><p>Notably, Ford would have won despite losing the popular vote — the first time a popular vote loser won the presidency at that point since Benjamin Harrison in 1888. Ford also would have faced a Congress dominated by the opposition party Democrats, with little mandate to try to bend them to his will.</p><p>Yet as the sitting president, Ford would have been the most visible target for the discontent that the late 1970’s would bring to an America grappling for the first time in decades with structural economic woes.</p><p>Inflation, which had proven impervious to Ford’s “Whip Inflation Now” public relations campaign, grew steadily, fueled by a second “oil shock” that once again led to long gas lines. Ford would have begun his first full term with a 5.2 percent inflation rate; by March of 1978 it had almost doubled, and it stayed in double digits throughout the next two years. That inflation meant trouble in a wide range of fields, from the cost of a mortgage to a new automobile to prices at the supermarket.</p><p>The plummeting approval ratings that hit Jimmy Carter — he was disapproved of by a 54-33 percent margin at the end of 1979 — would likely have befallen Ford as well.</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/e8/0b/ad8823cb46ffbb834b7a7e2471fe/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary5.jpg" /><br /><p>Of course, Ford would have been in a very different position than Carter; having served more than half of Richard Nixon’s second term, Ford would have been ineligible to run again for the presidency in 1980 under the provisions of the 22nd Amendment. It would have fallen to a new candidate to attempt to hold the White House for the Republicans for a fourth consecutive term — something neither party had done (with the exception of the FDR-Truman five-term run) since 1908.</p><p>In 1980, Ronald Reagan could run against the beleaguered Carter administration and the Democrat-dominated Congress by pledging a wholesale rejection of the party in power. With a Republican like Ford in the White House, it would be difficult for Reagan — or any other Republican — to make a blistering critique of business as usual. There is a reason why only one president in the last century has managed to turn the White House over to a candidate of their own party, and Ford would have faced that challenge with bleak economic conditions.</p><p>It’s also likely Ford would have sought to undermine Reagan’s 1980 bid. Ford always believed that Reagan’s 1976 primary challenge, and his lackluster support of the ticket in the fall, was one key reason for his defeat. Had Ford managed to beat Carter, he would almost surely have held Reagan in “minimum high regard” and done all in his power to damage him.</p><p>What about the Democrats?</p><p>With Carter effectively out of the picture, Sen. Ted Kennedy would have been the clear favorite, as he in fact was at the outset of his primary challenge to President Carter’s renomination in 1980. (“I don’t think he can be denied the nomination if he wants it,” House Speaker Tip O’Neill said at the start of Kennedy’s bid.) But the obstacles to Kennedy that emerged during his campaign would have been equally present had Carter not occupied the White House.</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/35/1f/15fce1904b19860720edcaa932c2/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary6.jpg" /><br /><p>In 1980, there was still a significant cohort of moderate and even conservative Democrats who resisted Ted Kennedy as the champion of his party’s left. Beyond that, of course, was Chappaquiddick, his 1969 drive off a bridge in Cape Cod that left Mary Jo Kopechne, a young campaign aide, to drown. Yes, it was more than a decade in the past, but as we saw in 1980, the press — so often derided as a Kennedy-friendly apparatus — had a powerful instinct to turn its attention to the front-runner. The series of highly critical accounts of his behavior — in a Readers’ Digest article heavily promoted with TV ads, in a “CBS Reports” documentary, in sketches on “Saturday Night Live,” would have been even more pointed in a campaign where Kennedy was so obviously the favorite. And there’s no guarantee that Kennedy’s answer in an interview with CBS’ Roger Mudd would have been any less wounding. (“Senator,” Mudd asked, “why do you want to be president?” The answer was a minutes-long word salad, interrupted by frequent stumbles and hesitations, that left even liberal journalists and columnists appalled).</p><p>Would Kennedy have survived the scrutiny? He did win 7.3 million primary votes against a sitting president — 37 percent of the total — along with key states like New York, California, and Pennsylvania. Could he have been upset by a fresh face on the national scene, like Arkansas’ Dale Bumpers or Colorado Sen. Gary Hart? (In one chapter of my alternative history book “Then Everything Changed,” I recounted that possibility). Would a Reagan candidacy have been fatally wounded by the unpopularity of a departing Republican president?</p><p>There are no certainties here. What can be said is that had Gerald Ford remembered not to liberate Poland prematurely at that debate in 1976, the Reagan revolution might never have happened.</p><br />]]></content:encoded>

Yet a small group of deeply unserious people has consumed an inordinate and growing amount of the speaker’s time over the last 12 years.</p><p>Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has given us fresh evidence of that this week as she threatened to pull the trigger on a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson only to deescalate — at least temporarily — after multiple meetings with him. But the standoff, for all its foolishness, gives the House a chance to reverse this drift and serve as a turning point toward becoming a more deliberative body once again.</p><p>Over the House’s more than two centuries, there has no doubt been all manner of cranks and questionable characters serving in the institution. It is a modern phenomenon, however, that we pay them so much attention. Today, congressional politics revolve around a rump group of lawmakers who typically hold no significant role on committees, often have served just a few terms, and whose rhetoric implies only a tenuous grasp of political reality.</p><p>We must stop taking them so seriously. We need a bipartisan pact that we’re going to stop letting the people who delight in the absurd have an outsize influence in the House. It would be good for the institution, good for Republicans and even good for Democrats.</p><p>Both parties have their gadflies and their fringes, but the reality is that the forces fueling historic levels of congressional dysfunction are coming from a small but growing group of Republican hard-liners. And it’s infected the culture of the broader House GOP. I’ve seen that up close, having previously served as an adviser to Speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan.</p><p>Lately, Greene has accused Johnson, a conservative derided by the left as “MAGA Mike,” of literally being a Democrat. She’s among a swath of Republicans who insist a tiny House majority can foist a conservative agenda upon a Senate and White House controlled by Democrats.</p><p>Similar nonsense was thrown at Johnson’s predecessors whenever they would strike a necessary bipartisan agreement. Republicans have indulged this ridiculous thinking too long; indeed, doing so has only emboldened the hard-liners from one speakership to the next.</p><p>Boehner could barely tolerate many members of the Freedom Caucus, and he did little to hide it. Ryan believed a dash of inclusivity and an open line of communication would moderate their worst instincts, and he held a weekly lunch with members from different pockets of the conference, including Freedom Caucus leaders. Kevin McCarthy went so far as to give the chair of the Freedom Caucus a seat at the leadership table.</p><p>No matter the approach, the threats from the far right never subsided.</p><p>Johnson similarly spent much of his first six months in office chasing around their unrealistic demands until he, surprising many, decided to pass a domestic funding agreement and a large foreign aid package with broad bipartisan support.</p><p>Greene’s threat to try to boot Johnson using the motion to vacate is the latest turn in a cycle that makes the House a miserable place to serve.</p><p>That’s why this moment offers an opportunity for both parties to begin to fix the House.</p><p>Democrats have already pledged the votes needed to protect Johnson, but only once. If Greene does reverse herself and force a vote against the speaker, he should be prepared to go further than just defeating it. He should call another vote to change the House rules so that one member alone cannot trigger the motion to vacate. This will require Democratic help, but it can be presented as a commitment to govern honestly rather than continually at the mercy of Greene or others operating on bad faith. Similarly, if hard-liners keep defeating procedural votes on the floor as they have in record number this year, Johnson should normalize the practice of bipartisan rules — again working with Democrats to effectively govern the floor if he must.</p><p>What people like Greene crave more than anything is attention. And the motion to vacate is their most potent tool for commanding it. It is the weapon that has, even in quieter times, hovered over the thinking of four straight GOP speakers. When that weapon is taken away, there is a completely different equation for leadership, allowing for rational decision making about what is best for the Republican Conference and the House.</p><p>Of course, taking away the motion to vacate does not solve all the speaker’s troubles. As we have seen in spectacular fashion this Congress, hard-liners can still make it more difficult to bring bills up for a vote, and they will still be able to raise money and play to the conservative media in ways that undermine their colleagues.</p><p>That is why this is not a problem that leadership alone can address. The rank and file, too, must not tolerate criticism that defies the obvious realities of divided government. There is a cultural peculiarity in the House GOP where it is almost taboo to say out loud that a conservative priority is not immediately achievable. Even behind closed doors, few words are devoted to what can reasonably be attained. Everything must be grounded in a fight for the maximalist position. And whenever conservatives foil a more realistic plan, they do so with impunity.</p><p>Change starts with a shift in culture of the House GOP Conference. It must be okay to say true things, like that hard-liners are making policy outcomes less conservative, not more, by refusing to back their own speaker.</p><p>As we have seen, change also requires cooperation from Democrats. It is reasonable for the minority party to question why they should be in the business of protecting a Republican speaker from conservative hard-liners. We should not pretend that Democrats’ primary goal isn’t to take back the House. And it is fair to believe continued chaos in the GOP majority sends a signal that it is not a party capable of governing. At the same time, there is also little evidence that these leadership fights break through with voters, especially by the time they go to the polls.</p><p>What’s more, should Democrats take back the House, it’s entirely possible they too will have a tiny majority, given how few competitive districts we now have. Democrats are not immune from party infighting, and it would be good for the whole House if both parties commit to rewarding sanity, not hijinks.</p><p>The alternative today for Democrats is a speaker more beholden to the hard-liners and an institution incapable of doing even basic responsibilities. A short-term assist to Greene or like-minded conservative bomb-throwers would do more long-term damage to an institution that nearly all bemoan as dysfunctional.</p><p>Morale on Capitol Hill is as low as anyone can remember. And why wouldn’t it be? Most weeks, little gets done, and the House is constantly under threat by people who have no interest in governing. This has contributed to an unmistakable trend of members retiring while still in their legislative prime. The U.S. House of Representatives has become a place where serious people feel like they don’t fit in.</p><p>Whether that continues is a choice. Johnson, to his credit, has shown that governance is possible if the loudest, most disingenuous voices are ignored.</p><p>If the hard-liners don’t like it, there is an alternative: act like a majority and back your speaker. And then win more elections so there are the actual conditions for conservative governance, not the pretend ones they’ve been operating under.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Wednesday will be the last workday for the group’s roughly 25 employees, though staffers will continue to receive paychecks and health care benefits for the next few months.</p><p>The development brings to a close a period of turmoil for the organization. FreedomWorks laid off <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2023/03/08/freedomworks-lays-off-40-percent-of-staff-00086188" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;40 percent&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2023/03/08/freedomworks-lays-off-40-percent-of-staff-00086188&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68730000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68730001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">40 percent</a> of its staff in March of 2023, and as a result of a drop in fundraising, its total revenue has declined by roughly half, to about $8 million, since 2022, Brandon said.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with POLITICO Magazine, Brandon said the decision to shut down was driven by the ideological upheaval of the Trump era.</p><p>After Trump took control of the conservative movement, Brandon said, a “huge gap” opened up between the libertarian principles of FreedomWorks leadership and the MAGA-style populism of its members. FreedomWorks leaders, for example, still believed in free trade, small government and a robust merit-based immigration system. Increasingly, however, those positions clashed with a Trump-aligned membership who called for tariffs on imported goods and a wall to keep immigrants out but were willing, in Brandon’s view, to remain silent as Trump’s administration added $8 trillion to the national debt.</p><p>“A lot of our base aged, and so the new activists that have come in [with] Trump, they tend to be much more populist,” Brandon said. “So you look at the base and that just kind of shifted.”</p><p>This same split was creating headaches in other parts of the organization as well. “Our staff became divided into MAGA and Never Trump factions,” Brandon said in an internal document reviewed by POLITICO Magazine. It also impacted fundraising.</p><p>“Now I think donors are saying, ‘What are you doing for Trump today?’” said Paul Beckner, a member of FreedomWorks’ board. “And we’re not for or against Trump. We’re for Trump if he’s doing what we agree with, and we’re against him if he’s not. And so I think we’ve seen an erosion of conservative donors.”</p><p>Brandon, for his part, said some donors would contact him to complain that the organization was doing too much to help Trump, while others called to complain that they weren’t doing enough to help Trump. “It is an impossible position,” he said.</p><p>In trying to balance these competing pressures, Brandon said he resolved to “keep a working relationship [with the pro-Trump populists] on the issues we agreed upon.” This too created conflicts.</p><p>In an interview with POLITICO Magazine last September, an ex-FreedomWorks employee <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715180108675,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d8-d8b7-a9bb-f7ff620d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715180108675,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d8-d8b7-a9bb-f7ff620d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58b3-d37b-a3ff-78bb73e60001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;claimed that the organization&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58b3-d37b-a3ff-78bb73e60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">claimed that the organization</a> under Brandon’s leadership had turned its back on its values while Trump was in office; during this period, for example, the organization issued tweets spreading election conspiracies and deflecting criticism of the Florida legislation that came to be known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. “He let a bunch of right-wing nutjobs turn FreedomWorks into a MAGA mouthpiece,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the former FreedomWorks staffer said&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68730002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68730003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the former FreedomWorks staffer said</a>.</p><p>Brandon said he “did my best to balance the two competing ideologies.”</p><p>In the midst of this turmoil, FreedomWorks <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715180164128,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d8-d8b7-a9bb-f7ff620d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715180164128,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d8-d8b7-a9bb-f7ff620d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58b4-dcc8-addf-d8bf49eb0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;launched an effort&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58b4-dcc8-addf-d8bf49eb0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">launched an effort</a> last fall to rebrand itself as a more centrist organization, one that could target the independent voters that its leaders believe would be more receptive to libertarian ideals.

It’s the latest example of how the conflict is straining center-left politics across the globe — and challenging the place of Jewish leaders in mainstream progressive politics.</p><p>“I was so distressed with my government’s position on this issue, I really contemplated whether or not I still belonged,” he said in an interview with POLITICO Magazine.</p><p>The progressive New Democratic Party had introduced a motion that called for the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state and a suspension of arms trading with Israel. Dozens of Liberals were said to be supportive. Up against a divided caucus, Trudeau’s government negotiated softer language, including support for a two-state solution and a halt to “further authorization and transfer of arms” to Israel.</p><p>During a dramatic vote in March, the amended motion was <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/members/en/votes/44/1/658" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;approved over the opposition&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ourcommons.ca/members/en/votes/44/1/658&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68780001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68780002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">approved over the opposition</a> of Conservatives and just three Liberals. That included Housefather, who left the House in a huff following his caucus’ standing ovation for the NDP.</p><p>For weeks, the three-term MP agonized over his future in the party. He spoke at length to family and friends, constituents, Jewish Canadians outside of his riding, and to Conservatives who entertained the idea of Housefather crossing the floor to join them on the opposition benches.</p><p>Housefather’s exit from the Liberals would have rocked Parliament and exacerbated tension within Trudeau’s caucus on the war in the Middle East.</p><p>Ultimately, he decided against bolting his party. And he recently opened up about his monthslong political rollercoaster, rising antisemitism in Canada and around the world, and how he responds to Jewish constituents when they confide their fears.</p><p><i>The following has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p><p><b>During the past couple of months, you were at odds frequently with your own caucus on Israel’s war against Hamas.</b></p><p>Since December of last year, pro-Israeli Canadians — including the vast majority of Jewish Canadians — were not happy with actions the government took, whether on the U.N. vote [to <a href="https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/un-onu/statements-declarations/2023-12-12-explanation-vote-explication.aspx?lang=eng" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;demand a cease-fire&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/un-onu/statements-declarations/2023-12-12-explanation-vote-explication.aspx?lang=eng&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68780003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68780004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">demand a cease-fire</a>], whether on the inability to articulate in the International Court of Justice that Israel wasn't committing genocide, whether on the funding of UNRWA and whether on this motion that came before the House where instead of voting against the NDP motion, the government decided to amend it.</p><p>I've been able to speak my mind and speak out publicly when I disagreed with what my party did. It allowed many people in the country, Jewish Canadians of all political persuasions and many Liberals who are pro-Israel across the country, to know their voices were not alone — that within the Liberal Party, there are voices that remain strongly pro-Israel, and that are incredibly concerned about the antisemitism in demonstrations and on campuses in this country.</p><p><b>Do you think your vote on that NDP motion forced some Liberals to rethink their views on the Israel-Hamas conflict?</b></p><p>I can't speak for everyone. What I can say is that a large number of my colleagues reached out over the weeks following that motion to tell me how much they wanted me to stay in caucus and to also try to better understand why it was that I was so disillusioned.</p><p>I had made my views very clear to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and her team, and to the Prime Minister's Office. But my caucus colleagues hadn't had the opportunity to hear from me. Since then, they <i>have</i> had the opportunity to hear from me on why antisemitism needs to be a high priority for the government domestically.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/99/92/2662c4a34ee8856c90addcdafd3b/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1235395136" /><br /><p>When Iran attacked Israel [in April], MPs suddenly realized they had voted for a motion that stopped us from allowing Canadian manufacturers to ship defensive military technology to Israel. So our democratic Western ally is being attacked by the biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. And yet, if it were up to this resolution in Canada, nobody should be shipping Israel anything to defend themselves. That woke people up.</p><p><b>The prime minister asked you to work on “concrete actions” with Deborah Lyons, Canada's special envoy for combating antisemitism. What can you say about that work?</b></p><p>I'm working on an action plan with Deborah.</p><p>We should not need to get injunctions in order to stop protests directly outside of churches, synagogues, schools, community centers. There has to be a protective bubble around those buildings.</p><p>In Montreal, now there's an injunction that's been continued yet again, after an incident where people blocked the Jewish community offices where the Jewish public library and the Holocaust Museum are. Nobody could enter or leave the building for three to four hours. You can't use your free speech rights to deny others their free speech rights.</p><p><b>What do your constituents expect of you?</b></p><p>Of course, they come to their MP. I'm not a pastor, or a rabbi or a counselor with any experience in psychological training, but they expect me and my government, and also the provincial or municipal governments that are largely left out of this, to solve the problem.</p><p><b>What are you hearing?&#xa0;</b></p><p>We're all talking about what's going on with antisemitism: What's going on on college campuses? What's going on in demonstrations? Should we move to the United States? Should we move to Israel?</p><p>The idea that there are Jewish Canadians that don't even know if their future is in this country — it is something that is horrific after this community has been here for the last 264 years.</p><p>I don't think anybody my age, or even alive today, ever expected to see things like this after the 1930s. Psychologically, it's devastating, to pretty much all Jewish Canadians, whatever their political perspective, whatever their history.</p><p>It's just a shock. It's not only Canada. This is happening in Western democracies across the world. It's happening in the United States. It's happening in Australia. It's happening in England. It's happening in France.</p><p><b>What do you tell constituents who are worried?</b></p><p>I empathize. I tell them I understand your fears, I understand your concerns. I talk about the fact that I brought a motion to the House of Commons justice committee, where we're going to be doing a study on antisemitism focused on college campuses. I talk about the fact that I've written to university presidents across the country and gotten answers from the 29 biggest Canadian universities. I'm also following up with universities regularly, and following up with students on campuses across the country.</p><p>I try to give them the glimmer of hope. The vast majority of Canadians are on our side, the vast majority of Canadians are not the people in the streets yelling hateful things. And the vast majority of Canadians just don't know what to do. But they also look on with horror about antisemitism in Canada.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/23/bb/c34038ca4d919214a22d374b2335/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1247878922" /><br /><p>The worst thing is for people to feel that the government doesn't care. The government cares very much. We just need to find the right ways to address it.</p><p><b>There was a lot of anticipation around you potentially leaving the Liberals. How seriously did you consider that option?</b></p><p>When my colleagues joined in to give a standing ovation to the NDP member who sponsored the original anti-Israel motion, it was very disappointing. I was so distressed with my government's position on this issue, I really contemplated whether or not I still belonged. That was the struggle.</p><p>I'm much more of a centrist. My positions on not just Israel but on a number of issues are very centrist. I believe the Liberal Party has to be a place for the center-left and the center-right and the center — not just the left. I wanted to reconcile my views with the fact that on a number of issues, I haven't been in agreement. I ended up coming to the conclusion that if people like me left the Liberal Party, then the centrist values that I espouse would be absent from the party that's in power in Canada most of the time.</p><p>I had so many Canadians from across the country, that were non-Jewish liberals, who said, "Please, please stay. Because when you speak, you speak for me. I want to know that my views do have a place in the party." That made a difference.</p><p><b>Did you visualize yourself as a Conservative?</b></p><p>Political parties are not black and white. This party is not perfect, and this party is not horrible. Political parties are creatures of an amalgam of people and amalgam of values. I just don't believe that other parties are inherently evil, or are inherently good.</p><p>Is the right answer to leave and not be a voice for the values I stand for in the big broad Liberal Party? What does that accomplish? It makes it less likely the Liberal Party is going to ever espouse my values. Or do I stay and accept that sometimes I'm going to be on the losing end of the equation — but I still contribute and have meaningful input, and one day, maybe I'll be on the winning side of more decisions.<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

Less than 17 percent of the money Congress approved has been spent so far.</h2><p><b>What we found:</b> Out of more than $1.6 trillion these laws provided for climate, infrastructure and energy, roughly $1.1 trillion was to be direct spending — largely in the form of grants, loans and contracts.</p><p>But it’s taken a while to get the dollars moving.</p><p>For the infrastructure, pandemic and CHIPS laws, agencies have formally awarded $242 billion to date, meaning the federal government has committed to pay out this sum. For the IRA, the government has announced roughly $60 billion in potential funding.</p><p>The amount that agencies have actually spent is even smaller, between $125 billion and $186 billion, according to POLITICO’s review of federal data. That number is a broad range because no public resource offers a full accounting of formal awards or spending under the IRA. As a result, we’ve included the full scope of funding announced under the IRA in our estimate in order to reflect the maximum amount of spending that could have taken place.</p><p><b>Why this matters: </b>The administration isn’t legally required to spend this money in Biden’s first term — and some of the infrastructure cash can’t legally be spent until next year or later. Biden White House officials predict a continued surge of formal commitments through at least January.</p><p>But the fact that only a relatively small percentage of the overall investment has been spent means the real-world effects may not yet have touched some parts of the country, including key voters in the election.<br /></p><br /><h2 style="text-align: left">2. Look beyond Biden's big announcements</h2><p><b>What we found:</b> The administration prefers to focus on a very big number — the amount of money agencies have announced they will provide to recipients under one or more of the laws.</p><p>These multibillion-dollar announcements have become a routine staple of the Biden era, often featuring a public appearance by the president or a member of his Cabinet. As of April, the announcements have totaled more than $543 billion, or half of the full value of what Congress appropriated.</p><p>Private companies, including those hoping for a share of the new grants, loans or tax breaks, have followed through with their own announcements. Those have totaled more than $866 billion in planned investments for industries such as advanced chips, electric vehicles and clean energy manufacturing.</p><p>But an announcement doesn’t necessarily mean the money will flow quickly — or that the announced recipient will ever see it. Agencies typically announce tentative awards after identifying a recipient and a funding amount, but the awards could still be under negotiation, and either side might back out.</p><p>Similarly, changing market conditions or worries about federal policy have prompted some companies to cancel or delay major electric vehicle, battery, solar and wind projects.</p><p><b>Why this matters:</b> Funding announcements can show that agencies are pushing to make progress on Biden’s agenda. Many published analyses of the administration’s policies have focused at least partly on the announcements. But the big-dollar proclamations may give an inflated picture of the impact that Biden’s policies are having so far.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">3. Spending over $1 trillion is a lot of work</h2><p><b>What we found: </b>There are several explanations for the gap between announced and actual spending.</p><p>For one, negotiations for this money can take time, with the federal government sometimes awarding money weeks or months after it makes the announcement. State governments and other recipients also have significant leeway to decide where the money goes — or even how quickly Washington can put it out. For instance, states that want federal funding for electric vehicle chargers must first compile plans for using the money. For large-scale infrastructure projects, recipients typically have to do the work before Washington reimburses them. That lengthy process can take years.</p><p>And not all announcements necessarily lead to the intended recipient getting the cash. For instance, the Energy Department announced it had selected a Texas-based company for a $200 million grant to support a battery project in Tennessee, only to withdraw the award last spring. DOE didn’t offer a specific explanation, but the company had drawn criticism from Republican lawmakers because of ties to China.</p><p>Another company told POLITICO that a behind-schedule environmental review is holding up the money that the federal government awarded it.</p><p><b>Why this matters: </b>The administration stresses — and our data shows — that it has made progress moving the money forward. But federal money comes with a lot of strings that frustrate some would-be recipients.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">4. Would these efforts survive Trump?</h2><p><b>What we found: </b>Trump has lambasted Biden’s green energy programs and <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-using-impoundment-to-cut-waste-stop-inflation-and-crush-the-deep-state" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;called for “impounding”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-using-impoundment-to-cut-waste-stop-inflation-and-crush-the-deep-state&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68850008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68850009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">called for “impounding”</a> congressionally approved spending he considers wasteful. He has been especially critical of the climate law and attacked Republican lawmakers who voted for the infrastructure law.</p><p>That increases the urgency for the Biden administration to implement the money effectively and quickly.</p><p><b>Why this matters: </b>A Trump victory would create massive uncertainty for whatever federal dollars remain un-obligated. He could halt or slow the remaining grant approvals and applications, and a Trump Treasury Department could revise stalled rules for clean energy tax credits to restrict access. And he could shift the speed and focus for the Energy Department’s approximately $200 billion in remaining energy loan authority — a program he proposed abolishing when he was president.</p><p>Read <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2024/biden-trillion-dollar-spending-tracker" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715091457112,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000187-1473-d989-a7a7-bfffa9da0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715091457112,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000187-1473-d989-a7a7-bfffa9da0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/interactives/2024/biden-trillion-dollar-spending-tracker&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5032-daad-a98f-7b3f4a150001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the full story here&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5032-daad-a98f-7b3f4a150000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the full story here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The poll found greater awareness of the Inflation Reduction Act, but still only 17 percent said they’ve heard “a lot” about it, and 35 percent said they’d heard “some” about it.</p><p>Of the four, the CHIPS and Science Act has the lowest profile. Only 9 percent of respondents said they’d heard “a lot” about it, while another 23 percent said they’d heard “some.”</p><p>Voters with higher incomes and higher levels of educational attainment tended to be slightly more likely to say they had heard about the laws.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">2. There’s a clear partisan divide over the laws</h2><br /><p>The greatest divide in the survey data falls along party lines. Self-identified Democrats are more likely to say they have seen, read or heard about the laws than Republicans or independents — and are far more likely to see them as personally beneficial or helping their communities.</p><p>For example, 37 percent of Democratic voters said the Inflation Reduction Act has impacted them positively, compared with only 12 percent of Republicans and 15 percent of independents. And 44 percent of Democrats said the bipartisan infrastructure law has positively impacted their community — far more than the 15 percent of Republicans and 23 percent of independents who agreed.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">3. Voters say they don’t see the benefits</h2><br /><p>The poll also suggests another problem for Biden: Broadly speaking, few voters say they’re seeing the federal government’s efforts to revitalize the nation’s infrastructure or build up a clean energy sector.</p><p>Only a quarter of voters, 25 percent, said “the clean energy and infrastructure projects approved since 2021” had increased jobs in their community. Thirty percent said they’ve had no impact, and another 28 percent didn’t know or had no opinion.</p><p>For the four specific laws tested — even when restricted to poll respondents who said they’d heard something about them — only around 25 percent said they had positively impacted them personally.</p><p>Asked about the combined impact of federal spending on infrastructure in their community since Biden became president, 26 percent said it had a “major impact,” another 26 percent said it had a “minor impact” and 30 percent said it had “no impact.” Eighteen percent of respondents had no opinion.</p><p>Biden can keep trying to champion infrastructure during the course of the campaign, but voters aren’t praising it right now.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">4. Many voters credit Trump, not Biden, for doing more on infrastructure</h2><br /><p>Many voters aren’t giving Biden credit when they do see positive benefits.</p><p>When he signed the infrastructure bill into law in 2021, Biden famously succeeded where Trump had failed. But asked who has done more to promote infrastructure improvements and job creation, nearly as many voters said Trump (37 percent) as Biden (40 percent). Twelve percent said they’ve both done about the same, and another 12 percent had no opinion.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, party identification is the key driver on this question. About three-in-four Democrats, 74 percent, said Biden has done more to promote infrastructure improvements and jobs — but an almost identical number of Republicans, 70 percent, said it’s Trump who’s done more. Among independents, roughly the same number picked Biden (34 percent) and Trump (32 percent).</p><p>Biden also has a slight edge among voters in the presidential battleground states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — leading Trump on the question of who gets more credit, 42 percent to 36 percent.</p><p>The Biden campaign’s most-aired TV ad seeks to make this point specifically: “For four years, Donald Trump tried to pass an infrastructure law — and he failed,” Biden says in the spot, which has been backed by $4.6 million in spending, according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political advertising. “I got it done. Now we’re rebuilding America.”</p><p>But on virtually every question about the spending bills — including whether Biden or Trump gets more credit — the poll numbers among respondents in electoral swing states did not meaningfully differ from the overall results. Some voters give him credit for the benefits they see — but nearly as many voters credit Trump instead.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Wade</i> nearly two years ago created a patchwork — and ever changing — landscape of abortion access in the United States, with roughly a third of states prohibiting the procedure in nearly all circumstances. That includes almost all of the southeastern United States, after a recent Florida Supreme Court ruling triggered a six-week abortion ban in the state that will take effect May 1 and cut off a key regional access point for the procedure.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a 160-year old aw outlawing abortions at any stage of pregnancy unless the patient’s life is in danger, with no exceptions for rape or incest. That decision could take effect as early as the end of May, though it is unclear how, whether and when the law will be enforced.</p><p>And ongoing litigation in other states, such as Nebraska, Iowa and Utah, could mean more changes to state abortion laws this year.</p><p>Abortion-rights groups are also pushing this year to pass constitutional amendments that would protect abortion access in states like Montana and Nevada and overturn abortion bans in Florida and Missouri.</p><p>Explore the map and table below for more on each state’s abortion laws:<br /></p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Octogenarians Bernie Sanders and Angus King aren't facing the same sort of criticisms as the president as they seek reelection in the Senate. There's a reason for that.</description>

But in the seniority- and tradition-bound Senate, campaigning octogenarians are still a very common sight.</p><p>Unperturbed by a 2024 election cycle that’s remarkably focused on the advanced age of both of its presidential nominees — or the health problems that have plagued elderly senators this term — both Bernie Sanders, 82, and Angus King, 80, are asking voters to send them back to the Senate for another six years. </p><p>They’re both likely to win, too, which would rank the two Democratic-aligned independents among the chamber’s oldest members in history. Sanders would be 89 at the end of his next term, while King would be 86, <a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2022/12/01/politics/angus-king-readies-2024-campaign-xoasq1i29i/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715375889761,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-bf28-d377-a5ef-bf6a21bf0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715375889761,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-bf28-d377-a5ef-bf6a21bf0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.bangordailynews.com/2022/12/01/politics/angus-king-readies-2024-campaign-xoasq1i29i/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-645e-d3a0-a5df-65ffd5170001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Maine’s oldest senator ever&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-645e-d3a0-a5df-65ffd5170000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Maine’s oldest senator ever</a>.</p><p>There’s a big reason why Sanders' and King’s candidacies aren’t as eyebrow-raising as Biden’s, though: They’re dealing with much different dynamics than the president is on the national stage. On the Hill, seniority is often a selling point to voters who benefit from the home-base power afforded by leadership positions on committees and in parties. Not to mention that, while Biden took on his age directly in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/09/biden-age-campaign-ad-00146136" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a recent campaign ad&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/09/biden-age-campaign-ad-00146136&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68a30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-7718-d498-a1af-777d68a30001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a recent campaign ad</a>, lawmakers have rarely felt compelled to take on the thorny, personal topic of their advancing years.</p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/60/44/64d31896438ea14df2f2d52e926e/senate-energy-and-natural-resources-committee-hearing-49912.jpg" /><br /><p><br />Before Sen.

Senate Democrats, by most projections, will at best have a 50-50 majority next year, barring a miraculous pickup in Texas or Florida. That means one future vacancy could shift the balance of power, if even temporarily. King and Sanders are both registered independents but caucus with Democrats.</p><p>Sanders and King’s Democratic colleagues also defended their qualifications to serve for six more years, noting that the impact of age varies depending on the individual and citing their pep in the caucus. Sanders had a heart attack in 2019, but both men, at least according to publicly available information, appear in generally good health.</p><p>“Every 80-year-old isn’t the same,” said Sen. Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.), who was appointed after Feinstein's death to succeed her. “And so, I think, to judge one person, or five people, or two people based on the number on their birth certificate is probably not the best representation of American freedom.”<br /></p><br /><p>Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.), who was considered a shoo-in for Sanders’ seat if he’d opted to retire, applauded Sanders' decision to run again and said “80 is the new 50 around here." Asked if that’s a good thing, Balint replied diplomatically that what’s important is that lawmakers are “doing the work that is needed for their constituents.”</p><p>In fact, what sounds like a talking point — that aging affects every person differently — isn’t without merit based on a broad look at Congress itself. Some octogenarians and even nonagenarians have thrived in the Senate, while others haven’t. A few have taken visibly difficult turns for the worse, acuity-wise, in the middle of their terms.</p><p>“It's really hard to make any generalizations ... you cannot take a position that an octogenarian is in some way certain to be impeded in a particular function,” said Dr. Gordon Lithgow, a professor at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. But Lithgow added that it’s not much of a surprise the risk for chronic disease for individuals in their 80s goes “up at an exponential rate.”</p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6347330399112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><br />It’s easy to see how seniority is particularly benefiting Sanders, who holds the coveted chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
