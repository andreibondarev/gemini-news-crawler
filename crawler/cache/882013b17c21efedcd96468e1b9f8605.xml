Some ballot campaigns, like Ohio’s in 2023 and Missouri this year, have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/29/ohio-abortion-referendum-democrats-2024-00124060" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;largely avoided&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/29/ohio-abortion-referendum-democrats-2024-00124060&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf5e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf5e0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">largely avoided</a> holding events with Democratic politicians or featuring them in ads — concerned doing so would further politicize the measures and turn off Republican and independent voters. Some, like Florida, have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/03/florida-democrats-biden-abortion-00150257" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;warned Democrats to remain at arm's length&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/03/florida-democrats-biden-abortion-00150257&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf5e0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf5e0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">warned Democrats to remain at arm's length</a>.</p><p>Others, including those in Arizona and Nevada, have either sent staff to candidate events or hosted Democratic officials at their rallies in an attempt to energize volunteers and collect signatures to qualify for the ballot. Nearly all are sticking to nonpartisan messaging calling for freedom from government control and personal autonomy and are refraining from commenting on candidates.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/1c/78/c29669df416b93aaea5f676ef645/gettyimages-2147888184.jpg" /><br /><p>“The message that polls the best, the message that, when we're collecting signatures, people respond to, is that Nebraskans should have the freedom to get the care that they need, with compassion and privacy, and without any kind of political interference at all,” said Taylor Givens-Dunn, a leader of the state’s Protect our Rights coalition working to overturn the state’s 12-week ban via ballot initiative. “We want to be clear that this is about people, not politicians.”</p><p>Givens-Dunn said while her campaign does not have a policy of avoiding events with Democratic candidates, she is not aware of any they have held so far — noting that the majority of voters in the state are registered Republicans or unaffiliated.</p><p>The Biden campaign is taking its cue from local organizers — for instance, hosting signature gatherers at events attended by Vice President Kamala Harris and first lady Jill Biden. Biden campaign aides believe that they “share the common goal of having the broadest possible coalition in November."</p><p>Still, Biden campaign spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg said, “[Former President Donald] Trump and his allies proudly brag about having already wiped away many protections at the state level and would ban abortion nationwide, so while we continue to support all efforts to protect reproductive freedom, the only way to truly restore and protect reproductive rights where you live is to vote for President Biden and Vice President Harris and Democrats up and down the ballot."</p><p>Yet there remains an inherent tension between Democrats and ballot measure coalitions. Both want to use abortion to motivate people to the polls, and abortion-rights advocates acknowledge that ballot measures alone, without a Democratic president and Congress, can’t protect access to the procedure. But as ballot measure campaigns work to appeal to voters across the political spectrum, they fear Democrats will make the referendums appear too partisan, and ultimately sink their chances.</p><p>“I'm not trying to suggest that Democrats shouldn't talk about abortion. I think Democrats should talk about abortion all day long. You just don't need to talk about the specific ballot initiatives all day long,” said a consultant working with several state ballot initiatives, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about campaign strategy. “Because when Democratic politicians try to falsely claim ownership of the ballot initiatives, they reduce the chances that they win.”</p><p>Voters have upheld abortion rights at the ballot box seven times since <i>Roe v. Wade</i> was overturned nearly two years ago<i>,</i> protecting or restoring access for millions of women, but the tactic has not yet been tested in a presidential election year.</p><p>Trump last month said he would not sign a national abortion ban if elected, arguing that access to the procedure should be left up to individual states. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Abortion-rights activists hope to use the ballot process again this fall to circumvent GOP-controlled legislatures that have banned or restricted abortion in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and elsewhere. Yet groups also are pushing ballot measures this year in states where access is not at risk — including Colorado, Maryland, Nevada and New York — drawing accusations from abortion opponents that Democrats are more concerned with winning down-ballot races than protecting abortion rights. Some Democrats have bolstered this perception by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/29/new-york-dems-put-abortion-on-the-ballot-00104285" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;releasing memos&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/29/new-york-dems-put-abortion-on-the-ballot-00104285&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf5e0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf5e0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">releasing memos</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/30/democrats-florida-abortion-marijuana-00108829" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;giving interviews&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/30/democrats-florida-abortion-marijuana-00108829&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf5e0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf5e0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">giving interviews</a> arguing the ballot measures will help them flip key seats.</p><p>“It’s obvious that the reason why there are pro-abortion ballot initiatives is to prop up the Biden campaign,” said Kristi Hamrick, the chief policy strategist with Students for Life of America, a group <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/06/arizona-abortion-referendum-battle-00145089" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;door-knocking against the initiatives&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/06/arizona-abortion-referendum-battle-00145089&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf5e0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf5e0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">door-knocking against the initiatives</a> in several states. “I’m not saying they’re cooperating illegally, but they’re all singing from the same song sheet.”</p><p>The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee in a memo last week urged statehouse candidates to harness “the power of ballot measures'' and work to “maximize the impact of ballot measures in key districts.” House Democrats’ campaign arm <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/04/05/congress/house-dems-and-abortion-ballot-measures-00150665" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;argued in another recent memo&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/04/05/congress/house-dems-and-abortion-ballot-measures-00150665&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf5e000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf5e000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">argued in another recent memo</a> that the ballot measures will help their candidates win at least 18 close races by “keep[ing] this issue at the forefront of voters’ minds.”<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/67/29/49eb40724a0fbdb90d2f5afb1333/abortion-missouri-24209.jpg" /><br /><p>Many Democratic candidates in Arizona, including state lawmakers and Senate hopeful Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/189136" data-person-id="189136" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715373139515,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d9-d0a8-a59b-ffd93d630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715373139515,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d9-d0a8-a59b-ffd93d630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;189136\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/189136\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Rep.

We have independents who are appalled by the taking away of abortion access and rights here in the state that are lining up to support the campaign,” she said. “And of course there is Democratic support for it, but we do not see it as a partisan campaign.”</p><p>Democratic strategists, ballot measure consultants and abortion-rights groups said candidates can’t rely on the initiatives to carry them to victory and need to talk about what they would do in office to protect or expand abortion rights. They believe it’s important not only to create distance that will protect ballot measures from being further politicized, but also to underscore for voters that caring about abortion rights means more than just voting for a ballot measure.</p><p>In some states, like Michigan, both Democratic candidates and the initiatives they championed won.

GOP voters in several states voted to protect or expand abortion rights and elect anti-abortion Republican candidates.</p><p>“There’s an education element there that Democrats need to do to make sure that people are voting a straight Democratic ticket in addition to supporting the amendment because the two ideas are not mutually exclusive,” said Matt Grodsky, a Democratic strategist in Arizona. “It’s clearly an issue with some voters that aren’t connecting them, and we can’t have a blind spot there.”</p><p>Some Democratic groups also argue that their candidates’ efforts, rather than undermining the ballot initiatives, can be beneficial.</p><p>Heather Williams, the president of the DLCC, said that the ballot initiatives in places like Arizona have a statewide strategy that focuses on big cities, while state lawmaker campaigns are focused on districts that may not get as much outreach.</p><p>“We're going to be working in communities that are further down their priority list — Yuma down to the southern border, for example,” she said, noting that they need only a few wins to flip control of the Arizona legislature to Democrats. “Their efforts in population centers certainly will have a positive benefit on us, and our efforts in these communities that are more isolated, that are more rural … — telling the story of our campaigns and our candidates, but also telling the story of the stakes of this election — will help up-ballot.”</p><p>Those benefits will also accrue over time, Williams added, pointing to Kansas, Ohio and other states where the abortion ballot initiative results of the past couple years have provided the DLCC a roadmap of which districts to invest in to flip in the future.<br /></p><br /><p>And many of the candidates see their promotion of the ballot measures as both smart politics and the right thing to do.</p><p>“I’m helping the initiative because it's good policy, and it's really important for voters to understand who's on their side,” said Gallego. “We incorporate it into our everyday conversations when we're out there stumping with voters, talking about protecting democracy and protecting freedom and part of that freedom being abortion rights.”</p><p>Activists on the right, in contrast, have called on GOP officials to get more involved in the fight against abortion-rights ballot efforts. Many are rebuffing these calls, echoing Trump’s position that abortion should be left to “the will of the people” in each state.

The Confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes of the Flathead Indian Nation challenged the Blackfeet Nation to a competition: whichever tribe could muster the highest voter turnout in the upcoming election would win one single buffalo from the other.</p><p>The wagering tribes were also keeping their eye on an even bigger prize: The race for the U.S. House of Representatives in Montana that year was tight.

That means finding funding for get out the vote programs and ad campaigns, for community events that help build momentum for Election Day and gas money for transporting voters. In Blackfeet country, DesRosier says, it’s popular to host community feeds, where voting groups or local party organizations set out trays of food, locals show up and candidates can give their stump pitch while everyone eats.</p><p>“Food brings the people on the reservation together better than anything,” DesRosier says.

Four Directions analyzed data on the portion of eligible voters in these two tracts who turned out to vote in the 2022 election. That year, turnout in two majority-Native tracts was 22 percentage points lower than in the majority-white tract. In addition, the decrease in Native turnout between 2020 and 2022 was higher than that of white voters, by five percentage points.<br /></p><br /><p>In other states like North Dakota and Arizona, Four Directions has worked to close the turnout gap between Native and white voters — with some successes. For example, through legal work and voter registration events, Four Directions registered more than 5,000 Native voters in Arizona in 2020 — nearly half of <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/arizona/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the 10,000 votes&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/arizona/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf730002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf730003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the 10,000 votes</a> by which President Joe Biden won this key state.

Rural native voting precincts don’t have the same access to news about upcoming elections as rural white precincts, he explains. That poses challenges for everything from politicians campaigning to voters hunting for information about upcoming elections.

And Tester needs Native American votes to win Montana.</p><p>Leaders representing nearly a dozen tribes — including the Crow, Blackfeet and Cheyenne — sit listening over a classic Montana lunch of ribs, pulled pork, beans and potato salad.</p><p>With fervor, Rodgers implores the seated leaders to use the power of their vote in one of the country’s most competitive Senate races to get concessions from some of the nation’s most powerful people. The stakes, Rodgers explains, are too high for Democrats in Washington, D.C. to ignore what Montana’s Native voters want: Continued access to Medicaid and Medicare, assistance in fighting crime and resources to preserve their Native culture and language, among other things.</p><p>“The Native American vote is being courted very aggressively in the state,” Rodgers says later. “The path forward for the Republicans to take control of the Senate again looks like [it] would go through Montana.”</p><p>But Republicans in Washington, D.C. recognize how important Native Americans are to Tester’s chances — and they are not looking to give him any policy wins.

It passed out of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs unanimously, but a handful of GOP Senators — including some who previously supported it — voted against it on the floor.</p><p>And yes, if you ask, Republicans don’t beat around the bush on how the upcoming Montana Senate race impacted the way votes played out that day. Says Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), “I don't think we need to talk about it. Everybody knows that.”</p><p>The bill’s demise highlights how important the Montana race is in the Senate, and the important role those communities are expected to play in elections.<br />“Native Americans … were the first casualty in this political battle,” says Rodgers, who supported the bill.

He’s currently in search of a bison bull — which he will award to the Montana tribe with the highest percentage voter turnout in the 2024 election.</p><p>“Honor the Iinii (the bison/the buffalo),” Rodgers says, “for as it returns now to our sacred land we can become whole again as a people and balance can be restored.”</p><p>The bison’s name? “Reckoning.”<br /></p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

And Monday is set to be another big day at the courthouse, when Trump’s former fixer Michael Cohen is expected to take the stand.</p><p>But Trump on Saturday avoided mentioning the witnesses or jurors in the case, likely aware that any public attack would violate the gag order imposed by Justice Juan Merchan. While Merchan already held Trump in contempt for violating the order 10 times and fined him a total of $10,000, the judge also threatened Trump last week with jail time for future violations.</p><p>Surrounded by roller coasters and amusement park thrills along a boardwalk in Wildwood, the former president railed against the trial that has largely taken him off the campaign trail. This was only the third rally Trump has held since the case began almost one month ago.</p><p>But in recent events, Trump has been escalating his attacks on the justice system and Biden.

If I wasn’t leading in the polls by a lot and running for president, they wouldn’t be after me. I’d have a nice place. I’d be down in Palm Beach. I’d be traveling the world,” Trump said, before repeating falsehoods about the 2020 election that he lost to Biden.</p><p>During the speech, Trump threw well-worn lines on the border, windmills and electric vehicles, China and migrants. And he compared himself to the infamous gangster Al Capone, which has become a regular bit on the campaign trail.</p><p>“Al Capone was so mean that if you went to dinner with him and he didn’t like you, you’d be dead the next morning.

Cape May County, where Wildwood is located, voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020.</p><p>It’s also an area that attracts residents — and media attention — from the battleground state of Pennsylvania and it is a quick trip from New York, where Trump has been spending four days a week inside a chilly courtroom over charges he falsified business records to cover up an alleged affair with Daniels ahead of the 2016 election.</p><p>Trump was visibly frustrated with Daniels’ testimony last week in court, where she described in embarrassing detail their alleged sexual encounter. Next week, Cohen — Trump’s former attorney and closest aide turned public antagonist — will be taking the stand to discuss his involvement in making the hush money payment to Daniels and orchestrating her payouts. In 2018, Cohen was charged with campaign finance violations, tax fraud and bank fraud, and was sentenced to three years in prison.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352754164112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>While Trump was stumping on the East Coast, Biden was making his pitch to donors on the West Coast with fundraising stops in San Francisco and Seattle on Friday and Saturday.</p><p>Ahead of Trump’s rally, Biden’s campaign and surrogates knocked his visit to New Jersey and his team’s recent assertion that they believe states like Minnesota and Virginia are in play. They also took a jab at Trump’s plans to campaign in New York.</p><p>“They’re talking about holding concerts in Madison Square Garden to turn out voters in states like New York and here, on planet Earth, in the Biden campaign, we’re going to remain laser focused on the pathway to 270 electoral votes,” Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler told reporters on Friday.</p><p>“We’re focused on communicating directly with the voters who are actually going to decide this presidential election,” he continued. “So, no matter where the Trump team decides they want to spend their time, the fact of the matter is, as I said at the top of this call, they do not have the infrastructure to reach the voters who are going to decide this election.”</p><p>Trump on Saturday also went after some of New Jersey’s most famous residents, including Bruce Springsteen and former Gov. Chris Christie. Trump claimed he attracted a bigger crowd than Springsteen, and invited the crowd to boo Christie, a former Trump ally turned critic.</p><p>“Does anybody like Chris Christie?” Trump said, before calling Christie “unhinged” and suffering from a major case of Trump derangement syndrome.”</p><p><i>Elena Schneider contributed to this report.</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

Three separate times, according to prosecutors, Menendez searched online for the cash value of the gold.</p><p>Those details and more are expected to emerge at the senator’s criminal trial that begins Monday.</p><p>Prosecutors allege that the senator or his wife, Nadine Menendez, took bribes to influence state and federal prosecutors to go easy on his associates, aid the government of Egypt and help seal a deal between an associate and an investment company led by a member of the Qatari royal family — even as he was one of America’s most powerful officials on international affairs, as a leader of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p><p>To prove their case, prosecutors will need to tie those gold bars to things the senator is alleged to have done to receive them. It helps that prosecutors have years of the senator’s phone and electronic records, including Google searches.</p><p>Prosecutors say those searches largely followed interactions involving the Menendezes and Fred Daibes, a New Jersey businessperson who is accused of bribing Menendez. The senator is alleged to have tried to help Daibes avoid legal troubles and to seize on a business opportunity involving an investment company run by a member of Qatar’s royal family.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/38/7e/8ed8026947e19ada5243ff65ee98/menendez-bribery-17700.jpg" /><br /><p>Another co-defendant in the case, Egyptian-American businessperson Wael “Will” Hana, is also alleged to have provided the Menendezes with gold bars. Nadine Menendez is said to have sold some of them before investigators searched the couple’s home and deposited the proceeds into bank accounts she controlled.</p><p>Here’s how prosecutors have framed the timing of each Google search:</p><h2 style="text-align: left">‘How much is one kilo of gold worth’</h2><p>In mid-October 2021, Menendez and his wife had just returned from a trip to Qatar and Egypt, where they’d met with Egyptian officials and had dinner with Hana. They were picked up at JFK Airport by Daibes’ driver, according to the federal indictment.</p><p>Federal prosecutors allege Menendez tried to get other prosecutors to go easy on Daibes, who is facing separate fraud charges in New Jersey federal court.</p><p>The driver took the Menendezes to their home in New Jersey.</p><p>The next day, the senator searched for “how much is one kilo of gold worth.”</p><h2 style="text-align: left">‘Kilo of gold price’</h2><p>In January 2022, Daibes’ driver — who is not named in the indictment — called Nadine Menendez and then she texted Daibes, “Thank you. Christmas in January.”</p><p>About two hours later, the senator called a federal prosecutor handling Daibes’ case — the first time the senator had ever called the person, according to federal prosecutors.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/d5/95/da7d9e92456ba961c2c2b3f60e16/senator-indicted-79057-copy.jpg" /><br /><p>Several days later, the senator searched for “kilo of gold price.”</p><p>The driver’s fingerprints were later found in the couple’s New Jersey home on an envelope containing thousands of dollars in cash. The envelope also had Daibes’ DNA and his return address.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">‘One kilo gold price’</h2><p>In May 2022, after a meeting between Menendez and Daibes, the Qatari investment company signed a letter to invest in a major real estate project Daibes had been working on in New Jersey.</p><p>“Thereafter,” according to the indictment, “Daibes provided Menendez with at least one gold bar.”</p><p>Three days after the letter was signed, the senator, his wife and Daibes had dinner in Edgewater — the New Jersey town where Daibes’ development would be. Later that evening at around 10:30 p.m., the senator hit Google again, searching for “one kilo gold price.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

Microsoft and OpenAI, in particular, have advocated for tight safety restrictions and licensing requirements that could favor companies with the most powerful A.I. models — arguments boosted by a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/13/open-philanthropy-funding-ai-policy-00121362" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;sprawling network&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/13/open-philanthropy-funding-ai-policy-00121362&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf8b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf8b0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">sprawling network</a> backed by a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/25/a-665m-crypto-war-chest-roils-ai-safety-fight-00148621" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;handful of tech billionaires&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/25/a-665m-crypto-war-chest-roils-ai-safety-fight-00148621&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf8b0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf8b0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">handful of tech billionaires</a>.</p><p>The voices of the worriers largely dominated <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/16/sam-altmans-congress-ai-chatgpt-00097225" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;early Senate hearings&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/16/sam-altmans-congress-ai-chatgpt-00097225&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf8b0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf8b0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">early Senate hearings</a> and White House meetings on AI, and their concerns were <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/15/billionaire-backed-think-tank-played-key-role-in-bidens-ai-order-00132128" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715378671692,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715378671692,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/15/billionaire-backed-think-tank-played-key-role-in-bidens-ai-order-00132128&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6489-d3a0-a5df-65ab3c4e0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;strongly reflected&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6489-d3a0-a5df-65ab3c4e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">strongly reflected</a> in an October executive order requiring regular safety reports on very powerful A.I. models.</p><p>Other companies, like Meta and IBM, which rely on open-source AI models rather than the closed-source framework pursued by OpenAI, Google and others, are pushing for a more open-ended approach with fewer rules — a view that has powerful allies among venture capitalists and <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;self-styled futurist thinkers&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf8b0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf8b0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">self-styled futurist thinkers</a>.</p><p>The fight over AI safety has prompted a number of powerful newcomers to descend on Washington — including Nvidia, the world’s third-largest company by market valuation and the leading designer of AI chips.</p><p>Nvidia didn’t hire its first Washington lobbyist until late 2022.

Kennedy Jr.’s running mate launched her campaign trail debut in Texas — but for most of the event, Nicole Shanahan was literally out of the spotlight.</p><p>Despite being the marquee guest for a criminal justice reform panel discussion at the LOV3 nightclub, she and her husband sat in a booth next to the DJ’s setup, off stage and out of frame of the cameras.

The Biden campaign views Haley voters as a core part of its coalition this fall, especially as polls show some erosion among traditional Democratic groups such as young voters. Top campaign officials continue to court major Haley donors and possible anti-Trump GOP endorsers while honing their messages for bringing in Haley voters.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, has made no such moves to bring Haley voters back into the GOP tent. Two months after she dropped out of the primary, Trump has yet to contact Haley to ask for her support, according to a person familiar with their relationship, granted anonymity by POLITICO because they were not authorized to speak on the record.</p><p>“A lot of these voters will come home by November, but his future is in his hands,” said former Indiana GOP state Rep. Mike Murphy, who had been working to organize a fundraiser for Haley before she dropped out of the race. “If he fucks up more in court, gets convicted and makes an ass of himself like he continues to do, then these people are going to continue to be disgusted with him.”</p><p>As the now-settled presidential primary enters its final weeks, the anti-Trump protest vote is expected to keep rolling in. The Trump campaign has rebuffed the idea that a lingering opposition to Trump in the primaries will be a factor for him come November, but Biden’s campaign is betting it will play a sizable role.</p><p>The warning signs for Trump are striking because of the geography of where those voters live: suburbs, the place Trump warned in 2020 were under threat in a Biden presidency, are still getting bluer. The latest example came this week in barn-red Indiana’s primary, where Haley’s zombie campaign won 22 percent overall. The numbers were even higher in the suburban donut counties like Hamilton, the wealthy Indianapolis suburb of gated communities with manicured lawns, where Haley won 34 percent of the vote.</p><p>Similar patterns unfolded in key battleground states across the country. In Georgia’s primary, Haley won about 13 percent of the vote; she performed 10 points higher in suburban Cobb County, north of Atlanta. In crucial and swingy Arizona, Haley won 21 percent in Maricopa County, gaining more than 1 in five votes in the Phoenix suburbs. And in Wisconsin last month, Haley took as much as 17 percent of the vote in the counties surrounding Milwaukee.</p><p>“In every swing state, except for Nevada, the number of Nikki Haley [primary] voters far outpaces the [margin] between Trump and Biden in 2020,” said Robert Schwartz, executive director of the Haley Voters Working Group and an adviser to the Haley Voters for Biden super PAC. “In all those places, if you can get 20 percent to vote for Biden and another 5 to 10 percent who don’t vote at all, that’s going to be the difference-maker in this election.”</p><h2 style="text-align: left">Trump isn’t doing anything to court Haley and her supporters</h2><p>Haley is hosting dozens of top donors at a retreat Monday and Tuesday in Charleston, S.C., according to a spokesperson. She is not expected to endorse Trump or encourage donors to give to any other candidate during the event, which the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/nikki-haley-is-huddling-with-donors-and-wont-endorse-donald-trump-yet-052d3d0f" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;first reported&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/nikki-haley-is-huddling-with-donors-and-wont-endorse-donald-trump-yet-052d3d0f&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf9a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcf9a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">first reported</a>.</p><p>Newly installed at the conservative Hudson Institute, Haley has focused her public criticism on Biden in recent weeks.

Since January, pro-Palestinian groups have urged Democrats to cast ballots for “uncommitted,” in states where that’s an option, in a rebuke of the president’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. In Michigan, “uncommitted” earned 13 percent of the vote, and in Minnesota, 19 percent.</p><p>There are still 10 states that will hold their presidential primaries between now and the first week of June, offering voters more opportunities to register their displeasure with each party's presumptive nominee.</p><p>Biden's next headache could come next week in Maryland, where there's an effort to get Democratic primary voters to use the "uncommitted" ballot line to express disapproval of the president's policies in the Middle East.</p><p>Haley, meanwhile, is on the ballot in all three states voting Tuesday: Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia. Unlike Indiana, all three have partisan voter registration, and only one (West Virginia) even allows unaffiliated voters to participate in a party primary — factors that could all dim Haley’s performance in them.</p><p>Both parties will also be carefully monitoring the votes from Nebraska's Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District for signs of discontent with the base.

Blinken on Sunday continued to walk the fine line laid out in a long-awaited report released Friday about whether Israel has violated international humanitarian law.</p><p>The report, which Blinken submitted to Congress on Friday after a brief delay, found that Israeli forces have potentially violated international humanitarian law, though it <a

not formally find that they had done so</a>.</p><p>Blinken didn't go any further when asked Sunday whether Israel has violated international humanitarian law.</p><p>“As you know, we put out a full report on that,” Blinken said, asked during an interview with Margaret Brennan on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”</p><p>“The report that we put out lays out some of the concerns that we've had throughout this period when it comes to humanitarian assistance, particularly the early months after October 7,” Blinken said. “And when it comes to the use of weapons, concerns about incidents, where given the totality of the damage has been done to children, women, men, it was reasonable to assess that, in certain instances, Israel acted in ways that are not consistent with international humanitarian law.” </p><p>But Blinken declined to say that the U.S. had concluded that Israel violated weapons-sharing agreements, saying that Hamas’ style of fighting “makes it very difficult to determine, particularly in the midst of war, exactly what happened, and to draw any final conclusions from any one incident.”</p><p>The U.S. does not plan to slow down any further weapons shipments to Israel, beyond the high-payload bombs that have been held up as Israel begins its incursion into Rafah, Blinken affirmed.</p><p>“What we've been clear about is that <i>if </i>Israel launches [its] major military

And Congress is urging them on, with legislation in the works to help hospitals expand their at-home offerings and to allow Medicare to continue paying for telehealth after lawmakers first granted temporary permission after Covid struck.</p><p>The appeal to lawmakers is potential savings if remote care proves more efficient, but hospitals also see financial advantage.</p><p>“It's a real game changer for us” and “one of the silver linings to the pandemic,” John Couris, president and CEO of the Florida Health Sciences Center in Tampa, said of Congress’ support for remote care. "We're all trying to diversify our revenue streams.”</p><p>And it’s bipartisan. <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_118_HR_8261?activeTabs=overview" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;House legislation&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_118_HR_8261?activeTabs=overview&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfae0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfae0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">House legislation</a> that would extend loosened pandemic rules for telehealth and hospital care at home won unanimous approval in the Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday.

A Carper aide told POLITICO that the senator plans to soon introduce another measure that would make hospital-at-home offerings permanent.</p><p>Hospital leaders believe spinning up new lines of business and making health systems more efficient have the potential to buoy a sector that is still contending with the financial fallout from the pandemic — now without the federal emergency funding that blunted Covid’s impact. The American Hospital Association points to costs rising at the same time the sector operated in the red every month of 2022.

Congress helped by flooding them with financial aid and by agreeing to pay doctors and hospitals for telehealth for Medicare patients.

That can run the gamut, from post-surgery observation to obstetrics checkups, behavioral therapy and even care for acute illness.</p><p>Adopting remote care early in the pandemic was, for many providers, the only way to continue their services and keep the doors open.

Three and a half years later, dozens of them are facing criminal charges that could land them in prison for years.</p><p>Dozens of others have not been charged at all.</p><p>Even though the fake electors all participated in the same scheme, some have been charged as dangerous criminals while others have been treated as mere dupes. These disparities depend almost entirely on where they live.</p><p>In Arizona, Michigan and Nevada, every fake elector is facing felony charges except one, whose charges were dropped in a cooperation deal. Their counterparts in New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin aren’t facing any charges. And in Georgia, three fake electors have been charged alongside Donald Trump, while others struck immunity deals.</p><p>Meanwhile, an architect of the scheme across all seven states, Wisconsin lawyer Kenneth Chesebro, has only received what some experts call a slap on the wrist after he reached a plea deal in Georgia, and he hasn’t been charged in any other state. The attorneys general in Georgia and Arizona are the only state prosecutors to charge any of the alleged organizers of the scheme. At the federal level, special counsel Jack Smith cited Trump’s involvement in the fake electors’ project in his Washington, D.C., case against him.<br /></p><br /><p>The wildly varying legal consequences for the fake electors have generated discomfort in some corners — especially since it appears many of the people Chesebro supervised may face much stiffer consequences than he will.</p><p>“In many instances, I actually think that the state-level electors themselves were the dupes in the fraud, rather than the fraudsters themselves,” said Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who has closely tracked the issue. “It’s so unusual to have this situation whereby it’s as though Kenneth Chesebro, the principal, is flipping on the subordinates — rather than the normal prosecutorial strategy of going up the chain of command.”</p><p>It’s the direct result of America’s “unusual” election system, according to Derek Muller, a professor at the University of Notre Dame’s law school.</p><p>“The presidential elections are really run by the states,” he said. “They are really decentralized. So as a result, you can have parallel behavior across different states and yet it’s not really governed by federal law; it’s really governed, at its heart, by state law, with all of the vagaries that state law might offer.”</p><p>A lawyer for Chesebro, meanwhile, said some of the fake electors went further than he’d wanted them to — enthusiastically claiming to be the real electors when they in fact weren’t.</p><p>“You can say he’s the architect or the planner,” said Robert Langford, who represents Chesebro. “But he never intended that these people would purport to be the real electors. In Michigan, Nevada, and Arizona, that’s exactly what they did. And that was the line that was crossed that resulted in criminality. In talking with the prosecutors, that was it.”</p><p>Chesebro, however, wrote a <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/chesebro-dec-6-memo/ce55d6abd79c2c71/full.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Dec. 6, 2020 memo&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/chesebro-dec-6-memo/ce55d6abd79c2c71/full.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfb80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfb80001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Dec. 6, 2020 memo</a> arguing that Trump could use the existence of false slates of electors to foment challenges to Congress’ certification of the results on Jan. 6, 2021 — even if the slates weren’t certified by legislators or backed by court rulings. </p><h2 style="text-align: left">A seven-state scheme</h2><p>In the weeks following the 2020 election, Trump — egged on by Chesebro and other fringe advisers — helped assemble slates of Republican activists in seven states won by Joe Biden. In the midst of calling local election officials to pressure them to reject certification of the election results, Trump also checked in with then-RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel to enlist her help in the elector effort, and he connected her with attorney John Eastman, an architect of the strategy.</p><p>Under the Trump camp’s guidance, the would-be electors then prepared certificates claiming to be the states’ legitimate representatives in the Electoral College. In two states — New Mexico and Pennsylvania — the electors included conditional language stating that the validity of the certificates depended on court challenges.</p><p>Trump and his allies then pressured state lawmakers to endorse these fake slates in hopes of derailing the transfer of power to Biden — a desperate gambit that failed. And even after lawmakers refused to sign on, Trump allies promoted the “alternative” slates as a reason for then-Vice President Mike Pence to block Biden’s victory during the Jan. 6, 2021, session of Congress.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6308279933112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Investigators have since homed in on the elector strategy as a key piece of Trump’s effort to seize a second term he didn’t win.

Chesebro used his relationship with then-Trump campaign attorney Jim Troupis — another Badger Stater — to reach Trump’s national orbit and help lead the scheme.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">Architect remains mostly unscathed</h2><p>Most of the prosecutors who have investigated the aftermath of the 2020 election have taken a hands-off approach to Chesebro.</p><p>Smith, the special counsel helming the Justice Department’s probe, identified Chesebro as one of six unindicted co-conspirators in his indictment charging Trump with trying to steal the election and deprive Americans of the right to vote. Experts have told POLITICO they don’t expect Smith to bring charges against any of those co-conspirators — at least not anytime soon.</p><p>In Arizona, Chesebro also received unindicted co-conspirator status.</p><p>And in Georgia, he was indicted but <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/20/kenneth-chesebro-an-architect-of-trumps-fake-elector-scheme-pleads-guilty-in-georgia-00122758" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;negotiated a plea deal&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/20/kenneth-chesebro-an-architect-of-trumps-fake-elector-scheme-pleads-guilty-in-georgia-00122758&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfb8000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfb80010&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">negotiated a plea deal</a> that won’t result in jail time.</p><p>Chesebro has reportedly cooperated with prosecutors in Arizona and Nevada, which is not unusual for criminal suspects seeking leniency. But according to Goodman, the NYU law professor, it’s quite odd for prosecutors to enlist apparent ringleaders in order to charge the people they supervised. Instead, prosecutors generally work with a criminal scheme’s foot soldiers to build cases against the people who organized it — in other words, they go easy on the small fish so they can bag the big ones.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6339541311112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>That appears to be the strategy adopted in Georgia, with Willis using the cooperation of numerous fake electors to indict Trump and many of his top allies. But prosecutors in other states have not seemed to follow suit.</p><p>“How the prosecutors can justify using Kenneth Chesebro to go after the smaller fish is one of the lingering questions and, I think, concerns about how this has all proceeded,” Goodman said.</p><p>Chesebro’s attorney, Langford, told POLITICO that the fake electors face more political risk than his client because they went further than he wanted them to.</p><p>“A lot of behavior after Dec. 14, after they signed those ballots — especially in Nevada and Arizona, where they’re like, ‘We’re the real electors, those Democrats, they’re all fake, the election was stolen, and we’re the real ones!’ — that was not his plan,” Langford said.</p><p>The fake electors who have now been charged may face severe penalties. In Arizona, they could face more than 12 years in prison, according to defense attorney Omer Gurion, who doesn’t have any clients in the case. He added that first-time offenders in the state usually get probation.</p><p>But, he continued, the fake electors case is extremely unusual. “So I think it’s a bit of a crapshoot in predicting a sentence,” he said.</p><p>In Georgia, the three fake electors who were charged could face 20 years for their role in the alleged racketeering conspiracy, though sentences well below the maximum are most likely for defendants with no prior criminal record. They also face charges with maximum penalties of five, 10 and 15 years for signing the false documents. That’s left Georgia with the widest range of potential outcomes, from modest jail time to decades behind bars.</p><p>The Nevada defendants, meanwhile, could face five years in prison at the most. But, according to former Nevada U.S. Attorney Greg Brower, it’s most likely that a judge would sentence them to one year in prison but suspend that sentence and let them out on probation.</p><p>“There’s no victim in the traditional sense, there’s no restitution to be paid, it’s not a crime of violence,” he said.</p><p>In Michigan, according to defense lawyer Maurice Davis, the fake electors could face a maximum of 14 years of incarceration. Davis added that the judge handling the proceedings will have broad discretion to decide whether to hand down jail time or just probation. But he said he expects some incarceration.</p><p>“The conduct was pretty egregious,” he said. “It was a conspiracy to subvert an election in the highest form. I don’t think we’ve ever seen anything like this in the history of our democracy. Given the unique nature and the potential consequences had they been successful, I would be surprised if a judge did not give them some form of jail time.”<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

That might be a good thing, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said Sunday.</p><p>“I think frankly, when you're being a good leader, you are often upsetting people on the right and the left,” Murphy said Sunday during an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.”</p><p>Biden has for months faced backlash from the left for his support for Israel as the country embarked on a deadly offensive in Gaza in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel’s southern border. Thousands of voters have mobilized to stage protest votes against Biden in the primary elections in states across the country. But as the civilian death toll continues to grow in Gaza and with the threat of a wide-scale invasion into Rafah, Biden has come down more forcefully on the U.S.’s main ally in the Middle East — most recently saying the U.S. would withhold some military aid to Israel, a comment that raised alarm on the right.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352615487112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>But taking a middle-of-the-road stance isn’t new for Biden, Murphy said. And it puts in line with much of the country.</p><p>“President Biden advertised himself when he ran for office as someone who would often play it down the middle, who would not pay attention to the extremes of the debate and would just do what he thought was right for the country and what the broad middle of the country wants. And I actually think that's where the broad middle of the country is,” Murphy said Sunday.</p><p>Murphy supports Biden’s stance, including his decision to hold back some weaponry.</p><p>“[In] Israel, what Joe Biden is telling the Israelis is we will be partners with you but you have to understand that the pace of civilian casualties, the amount of humanitarian disaster … is in the long-run, going to make Hamas stronger, is going to make it more likely that Israel will be attacked again and is going to make other terrorist organizations that have designs to attack the United States stronger,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chris Coons said Sunday that the legacy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be to damage the long-standing relationship between the United States and Israel.</p><p>Speaking on ABC's "This Week," the Delaware Democrat said of the longtime Israeli leader: "Right now his legacy is the huge, strategic and defensive failure of October 7th and his legacy could be a real gap, a break in the long, strong, bipartisan, strategic relationship between the United States and Israel. I think that would be tragic."</p><p>Coons, one of President Joe Biden's closest allies in the Senate, added of Netanyahu: "His legacy could instead be achieving regional security and peace for Israel."</p><p>Biden has paused the transfer of certain weapons to Israel to limit the ability of Israel to launch a full-scale attack on Rafah, a Hamas strong point that also has more than 1 million civilians in Gaza. </p><p>Coons explained to host Martha Raddatz the needle that Biden is trying to thread there.</p><p>"What matters, Martha, is whether the next stage of this conflict against Hamas, which Israel has every right to carry out, allows for civilians to get out of the way of any future attack on Rafah," Coons said. "And that’s what President Biden has said now publicly, as well as privately, to our trusted ally, Israel."</p><p>The senator also said that Hamas, which continues to launch strikes on Israel, is responsible for the war now under way.</p><p>"I do think it bears repeating every time we talk about this, that Hamas started this conflict and Hamas, and their conduct, has largely driven the humanitarian crisis that continues in Gaza," Coons told Raddatz.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Authorities, meanwhile, have seized on Fortson holding a gun when he answered the door to cast the shooting as a clear-cut case of self-defense for a deputy confronted with a split-second, life-or-death decision.</p><p>Investigators will consider these factors when deciding whether to charge the deputy in a case that also reflects the realities officers face every day in a country where millions of people carry guns, including in Florida, one of the largest gun ownership states.</p><p>Policing experts say Fortson simply holding a gun when he opened the door wasn’t enough justification to use deadly force, but investigators will also have to consider what information the deputy knew when he responded and whether Fortson showed any behavioral indication that he posed a threat. They also say the proliferation of legal and illegal firearms is forcing officers throughout the country to have to decide faster than ever what constitutes a deadly threat.</p><p>“The speed of the shooting is pretty intense. It’s happening very, very fast,” Ian Adams, an assistant professor who studies criminology at the University of South Carolina and a former police officer, said after watching the deputy’s body camera video of Fortson’s shooting.</p><p>“The presence of a gun enhances the risk. But mere presence is not at all justification for using deadly force,” Adams said.</p><p>The redacted video released Thursday by the Okaloosa County sheriff in response to allegations raised by attorneys for Fortson’s family shows the deputy speaking to a woman outside the Fort Walton Beach apartment complex who described someone hearing an argument.</p><p>The deputy, whose name and race haven’t been released, bangs on Fortson’s door, pauses, then knocks again, yelling that he’s from the sheriff’s office. Fortson eventually answers the door while holding what appears to be a gun by his side pointed at the ground. Within a few seconds, the deputy shoots Fortson six times, only then yelling for him to drop his weapon.</p><p>Sheriff Eric Aden said the deputy acted in self-defense, and he rejected assertions that the deputy was at the wrong apartment. Ben Crump, an attorney for Fortson’s family, said they remain adamant that the deputy went to the wrong unit because Fortson had been home alone and on a Facetime call with his girlfriend.</p><p>The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating.</p><p>Adams said beyond the body camera footage there has to be some behavioral indication that a person intends to cause deadly harm with their gun.</p><p>“We also live in a nation with more guns than people. If the mere presence of a gun were the standard for reasonable use of deadly force, we would be awash with police shootings,” he said.</p><p>The increase in gun ownership has changed policing in ways, said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington-based think tank that focuses on critical issues in policing.</p><p>“This is a tragedy on so many levels, for everyone — for the family and for the officer. Guns accelerate decision-making and that’s the challenge here,” he said.</p><p>In a statement Friday, Crump focused on the deputy’s quick use of deadly force, and the lack of a verbal command for Fortson to drop his weapon until after the deputy shot him.</p><p>But experts say officers aren’t required to issue commands or warnings whenever they use deadly force. David Klinger, a criminal justice professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis who is also a former police officer, said the standard is to give a warning when it’s feasible.</p><p>“But if pausing to give a warning or a verbal command is going to increase the risk of a deadly threat, then it isn’t feasible,” he said.</p><p>Scott Lacey, a former Air Force Special Operations Command officer who served in the same squadron as Fortson, said he believes Fortson’s shooting was unjustified.</p><p>“When he just opens the door, sees him with a gun and unloads six rounds on the senior airman, to me that just screams unjust right away,” said Lacey, who spent time as an Arizona state trooper after leaving the military. “The airman didn’t raise his gun and showed no kind of hostile intent.”</p><p>Lacey responded to a Facebook post from Air Force leaders that called for people on base to support Fortson’s family while maintaining professionalism. Lacey called the shooting unjustified and urged the commander to instead, “Take a stand and do something,” adding that he’d feel unsafe with the sheriff’s department at his doorstep.</p><p>It’s not the first time the Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office has come under scrutiny for its use of force.</p><p>LaTanya Griffin filed a federal lawsuit against the department in August alleging that deputies used a battering ram to enter her home while serving a search warrant in 2019. Griffin, who had been asleep naked, was ordered at gunpoint to walk outside and remain nude in front of officers and the public, she said. She was never arrested or charged with a crime.</p><p>In court papers, lawyers for the sheriff’s office said the deputies’ actions were consistent with “established, reasonable, and generally accepted police procedure.” The litigation is ongoing.</p><p>“I think the Department of Justice needs to take a look at what’s happening with the Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office,” said Kevin Anderson, a lawyer for Griffin.</p><p>In another incident six months ago, an Okaloosa County deputy reacted to the sound of a falling acorn hitting his patrol vehicle by firing multiple rounds at the vehicle, where a handcuffed Black man sat inside.</p><p>After hearing the deputy yell “shots fired” and “I’m hit,” his supervisor also fired at the vehicle. The man inside survived the barrage rattled but unscathed.</p><p>Internal investigators found that the supervisor’s actions were “objectively reasonable” because she was acting to protect the other deputy in what she believed was an “imminent and immediate danger of death.” But the report found that the deputy who initially screamed “shots fired” hadn’t acted reasonably in firing his gun. He resigned before the investigation was completed.</p><p>In her interviews with investigators, the supervisor mentioned that deputies had been through a lot in recent weeks, including the killing of a deputy who was responding to a domestic violence call and the involvement of another in an on-duty shooting.</p><p>The shooting of Fortson came just days after four members of a U.S. Marshals Service fugitive task force were killed while serving a warrant in North Carolina. Some officer groups have suggested such killings could affect how officers perceive threats.</p><p>“I don’t think the presence of previous shootings is ever going to be justification,” Adams said. “There is no world where officers don’t encounter a firearm risk. Officers swim in risk. But risk alone is not cause for using force, let alone deadly force.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

Russia said the village of Pletenivka was also taken.</p><p>In an evening statement Saturday, Ukrainian President <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/volodymyr-zelenskyy" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Volodymyr Zelenskyy&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apnews.com/hub/volodymyr-zelenskyy&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfc60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfc60001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> said fighting was still ongoing in the settlements of Strilecha and Pletenivka, as well as Krasne, Morokhovets, Oliinykove, Lukyantsi and Hatyshche.</p><p>“Our troops are carrying out counterattacks there for a second day, protecting Ukrainian territory,” he said.</p><p>The Institute for the Study of War said Friday that geolocated footage confirms at least one of the villages was seized. The Washington-based think tank described recent Russian gains as “tactically significant.”</p><p>The renewed assault on the region has forced more than 1,700 civilians residing in settlements near the fighting to flee, according to Ukrainian authorities. It comes after Russia stepped up attacks in March targeting energy infrastructure and settlements, which analysts predicted were a concerted effort by Moscow to shape conditions for an offensive.</p><p>On Saturday, Russia continued to pummel Vovchansk with airstrikes and Grad rockets as police and volunteers raced to evacuate residents. At least 20 people were evacuated to safety in a nearby village. Police said that 900 people had been evacuated the previous day.</p><p>AP journalists who accompanied an evacuation team described empty streets with multiple buildings destroyed and others on fire. The road was littered with newly made craters and the city was covered in dust and shrapnel with the smell of gunpowder heavy in the air. Mushroom clouds of smoke rose across the skyline as Russian jets conducted multiple airstrikes.</p><p>The AP journalists witnessed nine air attacks during the three hours they were there.</p><p>“The situation in Vovchansk and the settlements along the border (with Russia) is incredibly difficult. Constant aviation strikes are carried out, multiple rocket missile systems strikes, artillery strikes,” said Tamaz Hambarashvili, the head of the Vovchansk military administration.</p><p>“For the second day in a row, we evacuated all the inhabitants of our community who are willing to evacuate,” he said. “I think that they are destroying the city to make (local) people leave, to make sure there are no militaries, nobody. To create a ‘gray zone.’”</p><p>Evacuees bade tearful goodbyes to their neighbors as they were taken away from their homes.</p><p>“You lie down and think — whether they will kill you now, or in an hour, or in three,” said resident Valentyna Hrevnova, 75. “I hope that they (Russians) will not come, but ours (Ukrainians) will be here.”</p><p>Vera Rudko, 72, was among those who left.</p><p>“We drove through Vovchansk in the city center,” Rudko said. “I can’t look at this without tears. Everything is trembling. We didn’t sleep these two nights at all.”</p><p>Russia’s recent push in Kharkiv seeks to exploit ammunition shortages before promised Western supplies can reach the front line, and pin down Ukrainian forces in the northeast and keep them away from heavy battles underway in the Donetsk region where Moscow’s troops are gaining ground, analysts said.</p><p>Russian military bloggers said the assault could mark the start of a Russian attempt to carve out a “buffer zone” that President Vladimir Putin vowed to create earlier this year to halt frequent Ukrainian attacks on Belgorod and other Russian border regions. Fears also mount that without adequate supplies, Russia might even be able to cut supply routes and besiege the city of Kharkiv, where 1.1 million people reside.</p><p>Ukrainian officials have downplayed Russian statements about captured territory, with reinforcements being rushed to the Kharkiv region to hold off Russian forces.</p><p>On Telegram, Kharkiv region Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said that heavy fighting continued in the areas around Borysivka, Ohirtseve, Pylna and Oliinykove, but that the situation was under control and there was no threat of a ground assault on the city of Kharkiv.</p><p>In the meantime, artillery, mortar and aerial bombardments hit more than 30 different towns and villages in the region on Saturday, killing at least three people and injuring five others, Syniehubov said.</p><p>Zelenskyy confirmed Friday evening that Russian forces were expanding their operations. He also called on the country’s Western allies to ensure that promised deliveries of military aid would swiftly reach the front lines.</p><p>“It is critical that partners support our warriors and Ukrainian resilience with timely deliveries. Truly timely ones,” he said in a video statement on X, formerly Twitter. “A package that truly helps is the actual delivery of weapons to Ukraine, rather than just the announcement of a package.”</p><p>The attack was launched from two areas in the Kharkiv region early Friday, Ukrainian officials and analysts said. Russian assault groups attempted to break through Ukrainian defensive lines in the city of Vovchansk and in the region north of the village of Lyptsi.</p><p>Separately, Ukrainian forces also launched a barrage of drones and missiles on Friday night, Russia’s Ministry of Defense said, with air defense systems downing 21 rockets and 16 drones over Russia’s Belgorod, Kursk and Volgograd regions. One person died in a drone strike in the Belgorod region, and another in the Kursk region, local officials said.</p><p>Another strike set ablaze an oil depot in Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Luhansk region, killing four people and wounding eight more, Leonid Pasechnik, the region’s Moscow-installed leader, said on the messaging app Telegram on Saturday.</p><p>There was also shelling in the Russian-occupied Donetsk region Saturday, where three people died when an explosion hit a local restaurant, said Denis Pushilin, the area’s Kremlin-appointed leader. Eight more people were wounded, including a child.</p><p>In the war’s early days, Russia made a botched attempt to quickly storm Kharkiv but retreated from its outskirts after about a month. In the fall of 2022, seven months later, Ukraine’s army pushed them out of Kharkiv. The bold counterattack helped persuade Western countries that Ukraine could defeat Russia on the battlefield and merited military support.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Abruptly fired in a wave of government layoffs, Salva said her world began to unravel.</p><p>“The only option we have left is prostitution ... and I don’t see myself standing on a corner, getting cold, enduring violence,” Salva, 43, said. “This government is unaware of all that has been built to make us feel included.”</p><p>Salva’s sudden reversal of fortunes reflects the political whiplash being felt across Argentina. Past left-leaning presidents who enacted some of the most socially liberal policies on the continent have given way to a self-proclaimed “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/milei-argentina-chainsaw-fed35a37c6137b951e4adada3d866436" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;anarcho-capitalist&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apnews.com/article/milei-argentina-chainsaw-fed35a37c6137b951e4adada3d866436&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfc80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfc80001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">anarcho-capitalist</a>” whose fiery appraisals of social justice and efforts to dismantle diversity and equity programs have made him into a global far-right icon.</p><p>“The only thing this radical feminist agenda has achieved is greater state intervention to hinder economic process,” Milei said in a speech met with enthusiastic applause at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, earlier this year.</p><p>Few in Argentina are more enraged by Milei’s anti-woke agenda than LGBTQ+ activists, who worry his government is rolling back their hard-won gains. Since drawing attention as a brash TV personality, Milei has lambasted feminist and human rights movements as a “cult of a gender ideology.”</p><p>“Unfortunately, we are going backward,” said Alba Rueda, a trans woman activist and diversity adviser in the former center-left government of President Alberto Fernández, who made Argentina the first country in the region to allow nonbinary people to make “X” the gender on their national identity documents.</p><p>“What we have achieved is being discredited,” Rueda said.</p><p>After taking office in December, Milei wasted no time jumping into Argentina’s culture wars. He shut down the Ministry of Women, Gender and Diversity, banned the government’s use of gender-inclusive language and closed the National Institute against Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism.</p><p>In an announcement timed for International Women’s Day on March 8, Milei renamed the Women’s Hall in the presidential palace to Hall of Heroes. To the delight of his conservative fans — and the outrage of tens of thousands of women’s rights protesters outside his residence — he had portraits of historical female leaders in the room taken down and replaced with those featuring Argentina’s founding fathers and soldiers.</p><p>Milei has also scrapped a decree calling for gender equality in companies and civil society groups and ended gender-focused training programs. He has repeatedly railed against abortion — or, as he calls it, “murder aggravated by the familial bond.” A lawmaker from his party has presented Congress with legislation demanding the repeal of Argentina’s breakthrough legalization of abortion in 2020.</p><p>It’s a far cry from the past years when Argentina became the first country in Latin America to legalize same-sex marriage and a few years later recognized choosing one’s own gender identity as a human right. In 2021, the Fernández administration passed its employment quota law, requiring the state to reserve 1 percent of all jobs for transgender, transexual or nonbinary people who would otherwise struggle to find formal work.</p><p>Before Milei became president, efforts to fulfill the quota were just gaining traction, with 955 transgender people on the public payroll — far below the 5,551 positions allocated to them in compliance with the law. The fate of the legislation is now unclear.</p><p>“The quota does not make much sense,” presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni said. “Each position will be occupied by the best, most capable person, be it a man, a woman, a transvestite or anything else.”</p><p>Some 105 transgender people have lost their civil service jobs in the last three months, according to the union representing state workers.</p><p>It’s a small drop in the ocean of 15,000 state workers who have been fired as Milei races against the odds to push the state budget into surplus by the year’s end.</p><p>But transgender people who benefited from the law insist each layoff has a ripple effect on Argentina’s gender and sexual minorities who remain vulnerable to hate crimes and face widespread discrimination in the labor market. In 2016, 70 percent of transgender women reported making a living from sex work. In 2022, after the law was passed, that figure fell to 56 percent, according to a study released last year by Buenos Aires government officials.</p><p>“The quota, for me, meant the possibility of changing my life,” Salva said.</p><p>Milei’s libertarian administration says the layoffs are part of its austerity program and not targeted at LGBTQ+ people. Milei has also Argentina’s currency, slashed subsidies, eliminated price controls and closed other government ministries unrelated to gender and sexual identity.</p><p>But those in the LGBTQ+ community insist the president’s populist shock doctrine disproportionately affects them. In his much-memed Davos speech, Milei slammed “women’s ministries and international (feminist) organizations” for employing “bureaucrats who do not contribute anything to society.”</p><p>“There is a focus here,” said Clarisa Gambera, a gender specialist at one of Argentina’s main labor unions. “Many of these people worked in gender offices of public departments that were dismantled.”</p><p>LGBTQ+ activists have fought back the way the government’s many other political opponents have — on the streets.</p><p>“We obtained our rights thanks to many warriors who gave up their lives for this cause,” Ariel Heredia, a recently fired state worker who identifies as nonbinary, said at a recent protest in Buenos Aires. After being laid off, Heredia, 36, lost health insurance he needed to access anti-HIV medication.</p><p>In his hunt to find work, Heredia says he may need to dress as a cisgender man, hiding an identity he struggled for years to accept.</p><p>“It’s a contradiction for me,” Heredia said. “But I have to adapt.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

The floods are fueled by unusually heavy rainfall during Kenya’s rainy season which starts in March and sometimes extends up to June.</p><p>Hardest hit are people living close to rivers, including the Mathare River running through Nairobi.</p><p>In order to save lives in the future, the government last week ordered evacuations and the demolition of structures and buildings that had been built illegally within 30 meters of river banks. Officials say at least 181,000 people have been moved since last week and that measures have been taken to provide temporary shelter, food and other essentials.</p><p>But the demolitions have only led to more suffering as those affected say they are being carried out in a chaotic and inhumane way. At least three people have died in the past week when bulldozers brought down structures on top of them, according to rights groups, family members of the deceased and residents who spoke to The Associated Press.</p><p>Among those killed was Makinda’s 17-year-old son Ian Otieno, who was crushed to death when an excavator brought down a wall of the Pentecostal Evangelistic Fellowship of Africa church while he was inside helping save property.</p><p>“The driver of the excavator refused to listen to the pleas by the women that there were children inside the church,” Makinda said amid sobs.</p><p>Otieno was the only one of her eight children attending school and he carried the family’s hopes for a better future. A single parent of four sons and four daughters, Makinda faces forceful eviction this week from the $15-a-month tin shack she calls home in Kenya’s populous Mathere slums.</p><p>One of her children is suffering from sickle cell anemia that often leaves her bed-ridden and in need of costly treatment and her youngest needs frequent medical attention after being scalded by boiling water around the torso.</p><p>Overwhelmed by her situation Makinda tried to jump into the raging waters of the Mathare River to “end the stress.” Luckily, her neighbors stopped her on Wednesday and calmed her by giving her a local moonshine called “Changaa” popular in rural and low-income areas of the capital.</p><p>Makinda makes $2 day washing other peoples clothes and says she can barely afford one proper meal a day for her children let alone pay hospital bills. And now she has to raise money for her son’s burial, a costly exercise for most people in western Kenya, and move to a new house.</p><p>“My son’s body is lying in the mortuary without preservation because I have not paid. I cannot even afford transportation to the morgue,” she said.</p><p>Like hundreds of poor Kenyans whose houses are being demolished, Makinda feels betrayed and abandoned by the government. Some say they were evicted without the legally recommended three-month notice period that should be given before action is taken.</p><p>They also say they have not received the $75 in aid to look for alternative accommodation that President William Ruto has pledged.</p><p>Millicent Otondo, 48, a mother of three, lost both her home and her 20-year-old business during this week’s demolition.</p><p>The caretaker of a five-story building that was brought down, Otondo recounted how engineers marked the building housing her shop and home for demolition, which prompted people to break into it and steal her entire stock.</p><p>“I am really bitter because police stood by as people looted my belongings,” Otondo said from a local primary school where she has received temporary shelter.</p><p>Otondo says she has not received the $75 and even if she did, it wouldn’t cover her rent and is a drop in a bucket compared to the $6,000 in losses from her property that was looted. She also wondered why the building was demolished despite having been found not to be in within 30 meters off the river bank.</p><p>The government has defended itself against opposition accusations it was ill-prepared for the impact of the floods despite early warnings.</p><p>“The magnitude of the weather extremes we are facing, I don’t think anyone would be prepared for the weather extremes we are seeing,” Environment Cabinet Secretary Soipan Tuya said in an interview with local broadcaster Citizen TV. “Some parts of this country have never seen floods before.”</p><p>Experts say the devastating rains are a result of a mix of factors, including the country’s seasonal weather patterns, human-caused climate change as well as natural weather phenomena.</p><p>However, observers point out that the government received early warnings of the floods from the metrological department in October.</p><p>“This is hypocrisy, and insensitivity of the highest order,” said rights activist Boniface Mwangi. “The government knew the floods were coming, and even set aside 10 billion ($76 million) to prepare a nationwide response. What happened to those funds?”</p><p>He said the government also abdicated its responsibility by allowing the building of houses on land near rivers and swamps.</p><p>“Greed is the reason people are dying. Corrupt civil servants approved, and issued title deeds for riparian lands,” he said.</p><p>And amid the death and destruction caused by floods, the government is demolishing houses in the name of bringing development through a government affordable housing program, he said.</p><p>“Demolishing people’s homes in the name of affordable housing is a sign that we have a tone deaf government. People living in shanties can’t afford to pay for houses costing millions. Their entire life’s wages can’t buy any of the houses the government is building,” Mwangi said.</p><p>But it is the bulldozing of people’s homes during a rainy season that he calls the most inhumane.</p><p>“Why would you kick someone out of their home in this season?” Mwangi asked. “Poor people have been violated by the weather, and brutalized by their government.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

That would mean in-person speeches from the president, party luminaries and rising stars to draw television attention alongside a mix of pre-recorded testimonials and videos from other parts of the country.</p><p>The goal: drive maximum viewership on television and the internet while minimizing live programming and openings for protest in Chicago’s United Center. This would mean moving party business, such as rules and platform votes, off the floor and denying would-be demonstrators a chance to seize on contentious debates.</p><p>While the Biden campaign, White House and convention planners have only just started hatching plans, senior Democrats tell me they’re discussing whether to conduct such business before the convention even begins or move it out of the arena and across town to McCormick Place, their other Chicago venue. Serendipitously, Biden’s advisers may have a very good reason to move up such housekeeping: If the Ohio Legislature does not <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ohio-lawmakers-are-odds-effort-ensure-biden-appears-november-ballot-rcna151369" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715298450156,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018f-0b29-dff0-a7df-1f7ddaa10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715298450156,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018f-0b29-dff0-a7df-1f7ddaa10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ohio-lawmakers-are-odds-effort-ensure-biden-appears-november-ballot-rcna151369&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fc1-d37b-a3ff-7fdb2ca60001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;relax its ballot certification deadline&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fc1-d37b-a3ff-7fdb2ca50002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">relax its ballot certification deadline</a>, which is before the Democrats’ August convention, the DNC may have no choice but to technically nominate the president before the conclave begins.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351415987112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Also under consideration for Chicago: reviving the pre-taped delegation roll call from each state featured in 2020.</p><p>Not only were the clips memorable — who could forget the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-election-2020-oddities-9d8f36096c3b28f0e7f2052f0b190837" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715298475599,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018f-0b29-dff0-a7df-1f7ddaa10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715298475599,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018f-0b29-dff0-a7df-1f7ddaa10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-election-2020-oddities-9d8f36096c3b28f0e7f2052f0b190837&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fc1-d37b-a3ff-7fdb92c80001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Rhode Island chef&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fc1-d37b-a3ff-7fdb92c80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Rhode Island chef</a> standing on a state beach with a plate of calamari — but a video montage also means one less opportunity for hot mic spontaneity, and therefore disruption, from 50 states and territories worth of delegates.</p><p>“If there is one peep in that hall, the networks will be all over it,” a convention planner lamented.</p><p>The challenge, of course, is that the delegates attending and, more to the point, the donors financing the convention expect the rites of an in-person convention. The political convention industrial complex remains strong after centuries of tradition, no matter how much the operative class relished having total control over what was effectively a multi-day commercial four years ago.</p><p>So with campus protests over the war in Gaza raging and Biden being disrupted nearly everywhere he goes, Chicago’s organizers are plotting on how to preempt opportunities for heckling and quickly tamp down demonstrators who do get into the arena.</p><p>William M. Daley, the former Commerce secretary and son and brother of Chicago mayors, has urged top Biden officials to install a capable convention chair who knows how to wield a gavel and can restore order as needed, I’m told. One obvious possibility is Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and another is Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who before entering Congress was speaker of the California Assembly.</p><p>Convention planners are also considering a different chair for each night of the convention, to both share the burden and showcase as much of the party’s talent as possible.</p><p>For all the 1968 clips now being replayed of Chicago police clashing with protesters, it’s the prospect of disorder outside <i>and</i> inside the arena this summer that so alarms Democrats, because either display could hand Republicans fodder.</p><p>“The mayor owns the street but the party owns the inside,” Daley told me. “What happens inside the hall is reflective of our party.”</p><p>As Daley knows well, it wasn’t just the Grant Park images that conveyed chaos to the American voter. It was broadcasters Mike Wallace and Dan Rather being jostled at the convention, the latter of whom prompted Walter Cronkite on <a href="https://danratherjournalist.org/about-dan/controversies/punched-1968-dnc/video-1968-democratic-national-convention" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;live television&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://danratherjournalist.org/about-dan/controversies/punched-1968-dnc/video-1968-democratic-national-convention&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfda0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfda0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">live television</a> to denounce the floor managers as “a bunch of thugs.”</p><p>And while people are well aware of the video where then-Mayor Richard J. Daley mouths profanities at Abraham Ribicoff for accusing the police of using “Gestapo tactics in the streets of Chicago,” what’s less remembered is when the Wisconsin delegation used their turn in the roll call to propose suspending the convention and moving it elsewhere. Then-House Majority Leader Carl Albert struggled to keep control of the floor and was replaced as chair by up-and-coming Chicago lawmaker Dan Rostenkowski.</p><p>Democrats are quick to point out this is not 1968, when Americans were being drafted, or even 2016, when Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders’ bitter clash led to a summer convention that included thousands of unhappy Sanders delegates. The number of delegates who are attending as “uncommitted” — the write-in protest used by Democrats angry over Biden’s handling of Gaza — will only be in the dozens.</p><p>“They’re going to be so small in numbers, this is not like 2016 or even 2008, with the PUMAs,” said former DNC Chair Donna Brazile, alluding to the Hillary Clinton diehards who refused to back Barack Obama and created a vivid acronym for Party Unity My Ass.</p><p>What alarms some Democratic strategists is the evolution of this era’s protests. Protesters are savvier — they’ve managed to get inside dozens of events featuring the president and vice president — and their demonstrations also include some bad actors who are determined to provoke a reaction.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352186801112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>In anticipation of some protesters obtaining tickets, convention organizers said they’ll stage a war room and be prepared to drown them out with chants — “four more years” is always a standby — and block any banners with Biden-Harris signs.</p><p>That’s all how to manage the convention itself.</p><p>Just as complicated is how to handle the protesters beyond the walls of the United Center.</p><p>There’s already a joke going around Democratic strategist circles that the main difference between 2024 and 1968 is that the Chicago mayor this year will be on the side of the protesters, not the cops.</p><p>Forty-eight-year-old Brandon Johnson, who was elected mayor last year after incumbent Lori Lightfoot failed to even make the runoff, was an organizer with the Chicago Teachers Union and has yet to fully make the jump from activist to mayor of one of America’s largest cities.</p><p>It’s ironic because soon after he became mayor, he hosted DNC Chair Jaime Harrison for lunch and, according to a Democrat familiar with the conversation, immediately pronounced that “nobody else represents the city but me.” He also asked if Harrison would have his back as a fellow Black man (Harrison, I’m told, tried to delicately explain that the convention would be a partnership between the party, the city and the state of Illinois).<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/32/75/010df1ef4626bc46c337b7ca217d/election-2024-democratic-convention-safety-05650.jpg" /><br /><p>“If there’s any mayor that understands the value of protest and demonstration, it’s me,” Johnson told reporters earlier this week at a groundbreaking, dismissing a question about Sen. Dick Durbin’s (D-Ill.) concerns over unrest in the city during the convention. Johnson said, “Without protests and real demands of a government, people of color and women do not have a place in society.”</p><p>More striking was how Johnson responded to whether he thought it was appropriate for police to have been dispatched last weekend to a protest at one of Chicago’s art museums. He spoke in a detached manner — the museum “made that request and the police department reacted,” the mayor said — evading the question and leaving the impression he somehow wasn’t in charge of the city and its police department.</p><p>Johnson praised the importance of protecting free speech and initially said that was paramount to safety, which he called “second most important,” before seeming to recognize his error.</p><p>When I asked him what his vision of a successful Democratic convention looked like, Johnson repeated the same formulation — “safe, vibrant and energetic” — before saying he wanted young people to “see what democracy really looks like.”</p><p>At no point did he mention Joe Biden or the importance of the convention in helping the president’s reelection.</p><p>It was an eye-opening exchange. And it made clear why so many Democrats, in Chicago and beyond, respond to questions about Johnson with a sigh and hope that he’ll recognize the weight of this moment, both for his career, the city and the country.</p><p>Exacerbating matters, Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who lobbied the White House relentlessly for the convention, have a strained relationship. They’ve disagreed on issues from immigration to a new, subsidized stadium for the Chicago Bears.</p><p>When I first saw the governor and mayor earlier in the week, it was at the Field Museum for an unveiling of an exhibit on a newly discovered bird fossil. As the two sat in the front row before the event got underway, just a single seat separating them, they looked straight ahead in silence and did not speak to one another in the way politicians of the same party almost always do in such moments.</p><p>With the demise of longtime Illinois Democratic boss (and state house speaker) Michael Madigan, though, there’s no semblance of a political machine here. What’s left is Pritzker, a billionaire who’s won two terms and can bankroll the party, and a handful of public employee unions, most notably the teachers from which Johnson emerged.</p><p>The best Democrats could say about the Johnson-Pritzker dynamic was that, well, at least it’s not as bad as the Andrew Cuomo-Bill de Blasio relationship in New York.</p><p>“It's an event that’s critical to the Democratic Party, so we’re all going to work together to make it a success,” Cook County President Toni Preckwinkle, a veteran of Chicago’s political wars, told me when I asked about the mayor and the governor.</p><p>Preckwinkle was far less enthused about a disruptive cacophony of free expression in the city. While noting she was “old enough to have been in a lot of anti-war marches,” she said that although people are free to protest, “the challenge, of course, is when people decide that expressing their opinion involves impeding other people’s ability to go to work, or go to school or acts of vandalism.”</p><p>Senior Democrats made clear they’ll mostly lean on Pritzker and his canny chief of staff, Anne Caprara, this summer.</p><p>The governor already prevailed in a proxy war with the mayor over who would run the host committee. Pritzker installed another of his lieutenants to oversee the local organization that helps put on the conclave along with the convention directors, national party and Biden campaign. Johnson was, though, able to make a member of his inner circle a senior adviser to the host committee as part of an agreement to keep peace between the mayor and governor.</p><p>It’s a détente Pritzker is eager to sustain, at least through August.</p><p>Asked at the groundbreaking this week if he was open to calling in the National Guard for the convention, the governor said he didn’t think “we’ll need it.” But Pritzker made sure to note the Chicago police had jurisdiction and he’d only call in the guard if “the city asks us to — it would be completely inappropriate to just march into a city.”<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

The approach sometimes <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20140207-ukraine-usa-eu-nuland-leaked-audio" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;got her in trouble&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.france24.com/en/20140207-ukraine-usa-eu-nuland-leaked-audio&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfe00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfe00001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">got her in trouble</a>, but it rarely held her back. </p><p>Nuland recently left the State Department after serving at its highest levels, first as the Biden administration’s undersecretary of State for political affairs, and, for several months, acting deputy secretary of State. She previously was a career diplomat who held an array of roles under presidents both Republican and Democratic; her first posting more than three decades ago was as a consular officer in China.</p><p>In an exit interview with POLITICO Magazine, Nuland discussed her time in public service — dismissing chatter that she was passed over for a promotion — as well as her views on where American foreign policy has gone wrong and right. </p><p>Notably, she said the United States was not quick enough to realize and prevent the expansionist ambitions of both Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. </p><p>A longtime champion of Ukraine and the effort to counter Russia, she also warned about the perils of Donald Trump blowing up NATO if he wins back the White House in November. </p><p>“Don’t throw it out,” she said of the trans-Atlantic alliance, “because you would never be able to re-create it again.” </p><p><i>The following has been edited for length and clarity:</i><b>&#xa0;</b></p><p><b>How’s life on the outside?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Life is wonderful. I am doing a lot of projects that I had put off, seeing a lot of people that I love, and I’m staying involved in ways that are meaningful. I’m speaking on foreign policy issues I care about — whether it is Ukraine or ensuring that the United States leads strongly in the world. I’m getting a chance to prepare for my classes in the fall and work with the next generation of foreign policy leaders. I’ll be at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs. </p><p><b>Why leave the Biden administration, really? People said you felt passed over for the deputy secretary of State job. Is that true?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I actually didn’t compete for the deputy secretary of State job. I loved being undersecretary for political affairs. I love working with Secretary [Antony] Blinken. But as you know, I’ve done three years altogether and I’ve done eight months plus in both jobs, and so it was just the right time for me and my family to do something different. </p><p><b>Do you have any regrets from your time in the role?</b></p><p>I think whenever you finish a job like this, you wish you’d been able to do more on more issues. Travel more, touch more people, get more done faster, ensure the U.S. was leading strongly on as many continents as possible, mentor more of the next generation. And you’re always constrained by time, by resources, by the crises that overwhelm the inbox. So you always want to have done more. </p><p><b>Can Ukraine win this war against Russia? And how do you define winning?</b> </p><p>Let’s start with the fact that Putin has already failed in his objective. He wanted to flatten Ukraine. He wanted to ensure that they had no sovereignty, independence, agency, no democratic future — because a democratic Ukraine, a European Ukraine, is a threat to his model for Russia, among other things, and because it’s the first building block for his larger territorial ambitions. </p><p>Can Ukraine succeed? Absolutely. Can Ukraine come out of this more sovereign, more economically independent, stronger, more European than it is now? Absolutely. And I think it will. But we’ve got to stay with it. We’ve got to make sure our allies stay with it. </p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/f8/76/0f016aa045258539dc868670ba5e/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1458232004" /><br /><p><br />And we have to accelerate a lot of the initiatives that were in the supplemental, like helping Ukraine build that highly deterrent military force of the future, like deploying these longer-range weapons to strategic effect, like ensuring that the critical infrastructure and the energy sector are protected, like building up our own defense industrial base and that of our allies and Ukraine’s again, so that we and Ukraine are building faster than Russia and China. </p><p><b>But can it get all its territory back, including Crimea?</b> </p><p>It can definitely get to a place where it’s strong enough, I believe, and where Putin is stymied enough to go to the negotiating table from a position of strength. It’ll be up to the Ukrainian people what their territorial ambitions should be. But there are certain things that are existential. </p><p>Any deal that they cut in their interest and in the larger global interest has to be a deal that Putin is compelled to stick to. We can’t be doing this every six months, every three years. It has to actually lead to a deal that includes Russian withdrawal. </p><p>Putin is a master at what we call rope-a-dope negotiating, where he never actually cuts the deal. It has to be a deal that ensures that whatever is decided on Crimea, it can’t be remilitarized such that it’s a dagger at the heart of the center of Ukraine. </p><p><b>Was it a mistake not to push the Ukrainians harder to go for some sort of negotiated end to the war in 2022, especially the fall of 2022?</b> </p><p>They were not in a strong enough position then. They’re not in a strong enough position now. The only deal Putin would have cut then, the only deal that he would cut today, at least before he sees what happens in our election, is a deal in which he says, “What’s mine is mine and what’s yours is negotiable.” And that’s not sustainable. </p><p><b>You’ve had a long career, especially when it comes to Europe. Where did the U.S. go wrong in its understanding of Russia?</b> </p><p>With regard to both Russia and China, after the end of the Cold War, the prevailing wisdom among all of us — right, left and center — was that if you could knit Moscow and Beijing into the open and free global order that we had benefited from for so many years, that they would become prosperous, and they would become strong contributing members of that order. And that’s what we tried for a very long time. </p><p>That works if you have a leadership that is fundamentally accepting the current system. But once you have leaders who are telling their populations that this system keeps their country down, doesn’t allow it to have its rightful place, that has a territorial definition of greatness, that is bent on economic, political and or military coercion — that’s antithetical to this order, and then our policy has to change. </p><p>Did we realize fast enough Putin’s ambitions and Xi Jinping’s ambitions, and did we do enough to ensure that those ambitions stayed inside their own nations and didn’t spill out and coerce others? 20/20 hindsight? Probably not. </p><p><b>How much of it comes down to what particular guy is running the show? I sometimes wonder, could things be different if it wasn’t Putin in charge? If it wasn't Xi? How much of it comes down to the dude at the top?</b> </p><p>In highly centralized societies, which both China and Russia have historically been, without an electoral refresh of the kind that we all go through in the democratic world, it matters hugely, because it’s that human who’s defining what greatness means. It’s that human who’s deciding how to maintain order in that society. It’s that human — allowing them to speak, allowing a free press, allowing protests, allowing alternative political parties — who’s going to shape the options. And that constrains obviously the kind of relationship we can have. </p><p><b>What is the lesson we should learn about foreign policy in general when it comes to the experiences we’ve had in Russia and China?</b> </p><p>We should always try to talk both to leaders and to people, to the extent that we’re allowed. We should always offer an opportunity to work together in common interest. </p> <p>But if the ideology is inherently expansionist, is inherently illiberal, is inherently trying to change the system that benefits us, we’ve got to build protections and resilience for ourselves, for our friends and allies, and particularly for those neighbors of those countries who are likely to be on the front line of that first push.</p><br /><p><b>Where do you see the Israel-Hamas war heading?</b> </p><p>Essentially, there are two paths on the table. There is continuing this war with all of the destruction and horror and lack of clarity about how you end Hamas’ reign of terror. </p><p>The other path is the route that the administration and allies and partners and a lot of countries in the Gulf are pushing, and a lot of Israelis want, which is: a hostage deal leads to a long-term cease-fire, leads to a better future for Palestinians both in the West Bank and in Gaza, leads to Saudi-Israel normalization and a path to two states, and a region where the ideology and the violence that Hamas is offering is beaten by more opening, more opportunity, more peace, more stability. </p><p><b>Are you saying that because you believe it or because it’s the Biden administration’s position?</b> </p><p>I’m saying it because, anything other than that, this is going to happen again and again and again. </p><p><b>If you could go back in time on that one, what, if anything, should the U.S. have done differently?</b> </p><p>Beginning with the Trump administration, everybody fell in love with regional normalization as the cure-all for the instability and grievances and insecurity in the Middle East. And that’s a part of it. </p><p>But if you leave out the Palestinian issue, then somebody’s going to seize it and run with it, and that’s what Hamas did. I also think that both we and the Israelis knew too little about the terror state that had been established in Gaza. </p><p><b>You’re going to be teaching at Columbia, the epicenter of campus protests over this situation. If you could offer these protesters some advice as someone with significant policymaking experience, what would it be?</b> </p><p>Peaceful protest is part of the fabric of who we are and the fact that we allow it, and the Chinese don’t and the Russians don’t, makes us Americans. But when that protest becomes violent, when it impinges on other people’s human rights or denigrates others, then you veer toward coercion. </p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352186801112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><br />So, express your views, ask for concrete paths forward. But stay away from violence, make sure that it’s actually indigenous to the campus, that you’re not becoming the tool of outside agitators. And be respectful of alternative views as you expect people to respect your views. </p><p><b>What if you are peaceful? And you say what you want and the people in charge just say, ‘Oh, that’s very nice, thank you,’ and then they ignore you and they keep doing what they’ve been doing for years. How do you do just keep pushing on that front? Do you join the government?</b> </p><p>I would certainly say if you care enough to devote all day, every day to political change, come join the folks who are setting policy, commit your life to public service. I didn’t expect that that’s where my life would lead, but it’s been incredibly rewarding. </p><p>There are many, many ways to change policy, but being on the inside is not only extremely rewarding, but you can actually get stuff done. </p><p><b>If Trump wins, and leaves NATO or limits America’s role in NATO, does the alliance fall apart? What happens?</b> </p><p>First and foremost, America suffers. Because if you look at every single one of the challenges we have globally, even as we make the security commitment to Europe, it is the European countries who have contributed more to Ukraine — on the security side, on the economic side, etc. It is the European countries who have to adapt their policies toward China if you want to have an impact on China’s eagerness to coerce others. It’s the European countries who we need to help fund the Haiti mission, to help defeat terrorism in Africa, and provide prosperity. </p><p>If we are not part of that family, on a daily basis, we are standing alone, our own influence in the world is greatly reduced, and we have no influence over how they choose to spend their energy and resources. And they’re less powerful in doing it without us. </p><p><b>What about this idea that look, we’re the U.S. at the end of the day. We’re the superpower. Whether we’re in NATO or not, people are going to come along with us. Isn’t there something to that argument?</b> </p><p>I’ve worked for six presidents, Republicans and Democrats. I always believed that a new president with a fresh mandate from the American people should look at every global problem with fresh eyes, bring new solutions, and should have that opportunity, working with Congress, working with the American people, working with allies and partners. </p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/67/dc/fa06a6f441f8b1a974cd879bada8/u-s-congress-08624.jpg" /><br /><p><br />That’s a different thing than turning your back on bedrock, bipartisan institutions and policies that have protected Americans and advanced our own prosperity and global influence for 70 years. </p><p>Why do you want to throw out what’s working and what benefits us for no other reason than you’ve had a fit of pique? Work within the institution to make it work better. Don’t throw it out, because you would never be able to re-create it again. </p><p><b>Does the rest of the world fear the United States?</b> </p><p>Is fear what we want from the rest of the world? </p><p><b>Sometimes.</b> </p><p>I think what we want from the rest of the world is they see us leading in a manner that advances their own security, advances their own prosperity, creates this community of nations that can handle global problems — whether they are terrorist problems, whether they are health problems, whether they’re environmental problems — and we do it in a primarily self-interested but unselfish way, and we’re creating that community. </p><p>They should only fear us if they’re opponents of a largely liberal democratic way of advancing human prosperity. And in that context, if they are viciously invading a neighbor, if they are coercing a little state because they can, then I hope they would fear our reaction and the reaction that we will build with other democracies who want to protect the system that favors freedom. </p><p><b>Do you ever plan to go back into government?</b> </p><p>I love what I did for 35 years. I’ve always loved it. And I continue to love it. So in the right circumstances, of course.</p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

The voice was close to SNL-worthy.</p><p>“Mike is straight out of central casting,” fake Trump said.</p><p>This is true. Johnson, a former high school thespian, is boyish and nerdy and exudes a southern sweetness that even his most vociferous critics don’t deny.</p><p>“He’s a good speaker of the House,” he continued.</p> <p>That would have been highly debatable not long ago, but Johnson is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/08/mike-johnson-house-speaker-congress-00156764" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;enjoying a period of renewed respect&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/08/mike-johnson-house-speaker-congress-00156764&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfec0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfec0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">enjoying a period of renewed respect</a>, particularly after avoiding a shutdown and pushing through aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Most House Republicans are now more frustrated with far-right members who make Johnson’s life difficult than they are with Johnson. Democrats rewarded him for his streak of responsible governing by saving him from a motion to vacate.</p><p>“I’ve liked him!” Johnson-as-Trump boasted.</p><p>Also true. Johnson seems to have picked the lock of Trump relationship management, getting the former president to stand down on the aid package and the motion to vacate.</p><p>So if that Trump impersonation makes it sound like the speaker is in a good mood, it’s because he is.</p><p>A few hours after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s attempt to oust him was easily defeated, Johnson sat down for an interview with the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Deep Dive podcast&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfec0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfec0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Deep Dive podcast</a> in the speaker’s suite, where he sat under a painting of his idol Ronald Reagan and answered questions for over an hour.<br /></p><br /><p>Johnson said he would not try to defund the office of special counsel Jack Smith, as sought by Greene.</p><p>The longtime social conservative said he wouldn’t try to pass a nationwide abortion ban if Republicans won full control of Washington in November, citing Trump’s call to let states decide the matter.</p><p>He also talked about Israel, January 6, the future of conservatism and his relationships with key Washington leaders, such as Joe Biden (his age “concerns me deeply”), Hakeem Jeffries (“a good family man”), Kevin McCarthy (“I have a lot of sympathy for” him), and, of course, Donald Trump, who, Johnson noted, has never heard his impersonation but thinks he would like it.</p><p>“Imitation,” he said, “is the greatest form of flattery.”</p><p><i>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity with help from Deep Dive senior producer Alex Keeney.</i><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/41/22/33f4e43240e5831170641ada3f65/u-s-congress-18782.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Lizza: So let's start with the motion to vacate. That resolution said that you aided and abetted Democrats in destroying our country, and 11 Republicans agreed with that and voted not to table it. Which of the 11 Republicans surprised you the most?</b></p><p>I haven't even studied the list. I haven't had time after the vote on the floor.</p><p><b>Lizza: You want to hear it? Biggs. Burlison. Crane. Davidson. Gosar. Greene. Massie. Mooney. Moore of Alabama. Roy and Spartz.&#xa0;</b></p><p>Hmm, I'd say several of those surprise me.</p><p>Look, those are all friends and colleagues I’ve worked with for a long time. I would not read too much into the voting against the motion to table. In fact, a couple of those folks told me privately that they would never have voted to vacate, and they wished it hadn't happened; but for some reason, they felt like it was important not to go on record against, or to be in favor of the motion to table.</p><p>I don't quite understand the rationale there, but I'll take them at their word. Look, we have a job to do here. We have to govern. I'm glad that that was done. Let's rip the Band-Aid off and get it done. I regret that it had to come to that. I spent a lot of time over the last couple days talking with Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene and even Paul Gosar about it. It's the way I operate. It's the way I've been leading since I got the job.</p><p>I take thoughts, suggestions, ideas from members all the time, almost on an hourly basis. And when they're constructive ideas, we try to implement them. That's how you do this job, especially when you have the smallest majority in U.S. history and a one-vote margin. You need every member on the team to feel like they're contributing and feel like they have a say in it. And so it's a gigantic part of every day here. That's what I was doing with them, and I didn't think they would go through with it.</p><p>But you know what? I went up and talked to all three of the ones who brought the motion, Thomas and Marjorie too before we left the chamber. They were some of the last to leave. And, I said, “You know what? I don't carry grudges, and I'm not angry about this. We have to work together. And I want to work with you guys and those ideas we were talking about. I'm still working on them, so I hope we can put this behind us and move forward.”</p><p><b>Bade: Did they say why they chose to do this [on Wednesday] after saying they'd give you some time to answer their requests?&#xa0;</b></p><p>They didn't have an answer for that. I think I probably surprised them by my approach and demeanor on it. But who knows? I can't get in the mind of anybody else. What I do know is that we have an important job to do here.</p><p>These are perilous times for the country. There are hot wars around the globe. We have allies in jeopardy, our border’s wide open. The cost of living is through the roof. The crime rate’s through the roof. We’ve got antisemitism and angry mobs on college campuses. This is no time for frivolous, palace intrigue and politics.</p><p>We have got to have a functioning Congress, and I think the landslide vote against removing the speaker is a signal that I think people on both sides of the aisle obviously understand this is not a time for games.</p><p><b>Lizza: Having said that, I think people are curious for you to just take us inside these negotiations that you had this week with Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene. Rachael reported that there were at least three demands: the “Hastert Rule,” no more aid to Ukraine and defunding Jack Smith's special counsel office. Are those on the table for you?</b></p><p>Well, first of all, there weren't negotiations. I did to Thomas and Marjorie exactly what I do with all members of the conference. As I said, people come in all the time with ideas and we process them. I don't make snap judgments.</p><p>On the Hastert Rule, as it's called, there are a couple of instances where there wasn't the majority of Republicans [voting for a bill on the floor]. One was in the appropriations process. But as I explained to the two of them in my office, we did have a whip count that did have a majority of Republicans. Eight people flipped at the last minute. And that's not something the speaker can control. We didn't break the rule. I've been following the Hastert Rule since the day I got the gavel.</p><p>The Ukraine vote got slightly fewer Republicans that voted for it, but that vote wasn't whipped. And so the Hastert Rule has never been violated so long as I've been involved. And I have no intention of doing so. So agreeing to that wasn't a negotiation. I just affirmed, yeah, I'm already committed to that.</p><p>With regard to Ukraine funding, I don't expect that there's any further request for funding before the end of this year. That was their demand. And I said, I'm already working under that assumption. So you're not asking me to do anything that I haven't already thought and resolved to do.</p><p>And then with regard to defunding Jack Smith, look, I think that there's been a terrible dereliction of duty with regard to the special counsel and how the whole system has been abused, and how they've engaged in lawfare against President Trump. All of these things are, to me, self-evident truths.</p><p>But that's not something you wave a wand and just eliminate the special counsel as a provision. It's been part of the law, you know, the tradition and the law for 25 years. Before that, it was the independent counsel. And I explained to both of them, as a former constitutional law attorney and litigator myself, that there is a necessity for a function like that, because sometimes the Department of Justice, which is an executive branch agency, can't necessarily, without a conflict of interest, investigate or prosecute the president who's their boss or the president's family. So you have to have some functioning equivalent of that.</p><p><b>Bade: So are you prepared then to stick this into appropriations bills to defund the special counsel?&#xa0;</b></p><p>No.</p><p>We were in the very beginning stages of even beginning to investigate what that would look like. I do think there has to be accountability. Congress has the power of the purse, of course. And we have oversight responsibility. And we've been vigorously using both of those powers. I think we need to look very closely at how we address what I regard to be special counsels that are outside the bounds of what they're intended and supposed to do. But no decisions were made about any of that yet.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/f6/ba/5580b97e4c98bb2c999171391b9a/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2148449338" /><br /><p><b>Lizza: On the motion to vacate, I want to ask you about the role of former President Trump. He came out full-throated against it, but he also said at some point he may favor a motion to vacate. So, a couple of questions. One is how did you neutralize Trump on this issue? And do you worry about that latter part of the statement that sounds a bit like a threat?</b></p><p>No, I don't take it as a threat. I was with President Trump this past weekend at Mar-a-Lago, and he invited me up on the stage. I was the only other person besides him who spoke, when there were potential vice presidential picks on the stage.</p><p>He's been very supportive. I know him very well. We’ve worked together for almost eight years now. We came to Washington at the same time, and we worked together very well over that period. I have always been very forthright with him and very honest, and told him what I thought was in his best interest, in the country's best interest, even if sometimes he didn't necessarily agree. But on reflection, he often says, “Mike is a really good guy. He's doing a really hard job.”</p><p>I think we have a very good relationship of trust. And he knows that when I advise him of something or give him an idea or tell him something I have to do, I think he appreciates that I'm operating in good faith. And that means a lot to President Trump.</p><p>I believe he's going to be elected president again. And I think if I'm serving as speaker and I intend to be, I think he and I having a close relationship will be very important for the country because we have a lot of problems to fix.</p><p><b>Bade: Some Republicans say that you are only speaker right now because of him. Do you agree?</b></p><p>Well, I don't know. He did throw in an endorsement of me when the speaker's race was ongoing. We all remember well, we closed Congress for three weeks because we didn't have a speaker.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/55/07/2561db7444a9b0dc14a207b3ec58/house-of-representatives-63249.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Lizza: It’s all a blur?</b></p><p>Yes, it's all a blur to me. The entire last six months is a blur to me in some way.</p><p>But this is an important thing to say: I never aspired to be speaker of the House. This was not on my bucket list. I was quite content to be a lieutenant. I was on the leadership team, and I worked against the motion to vacate for Kevin McCarthy. I then worked to get Steve Scalise elected speaker, and Jim Jordan and the more senior guys who are very close friends of mine. And it didn't happen.</p><p>I was sitting in the back of the room as that played out. I had a sense that I could get 217 votes, but I didn't jump forward and put myself out there as a candidate because that's not my way.</p><p>Somebody told me — I had a mentor when I was in eighth grade — and they said, “Mike, always remember this: Real leadership is recognized and not imposed.” And I've thought about that a lot over my life, and I'm not the type of person who puts myself out there and says, “I'm going to be the leader.” To me, you let other people recognize it and call you forward. And that's ultimately what happened.</p><p><b>Lizza: The fact that you mentioned a mentor just reminded me of something. Rep. Chip Roy was your mentor when you were a freshman.&#xa0;</b></p><p>Actually, it was the opposite. I was his mentor. I did an exceptional job with that, didn’t I?</p><p><b>Lizza: So does that one sting? Is there a particular sting from his criticism, given the history of that relationship?&#xa0;</b></p><p>It doesn't. Look, I regard Chip as a friend. He’s an interesting character.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/1b/9c/d68a360a4e92905f5643fdf5a4ab/u-s-congress-67015.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Lizza: You’re very forgiving.</b></p><p>Well, that's my worldview. I'm a Bible-believing Christian. That's one of the first commands we have. You're supposed to love your enemies. Nobody in this building is my enemy. We have political opposition and people on the other side of the aisle and even sometimes people in our own camp, but they're not enemies. They're all colleagues and friends. I regard them all as such. You know, the Bible's very clear. You're supposed to bless even those who persecute you. I'm getting a lot of practice in that right now. But there's lots of biblical admonitions that apply here. “A soft word turns away wrath.”</p><p>You get a lot further in a legislative body when you can build relationships with people and work on building trust among colleagues. And that's what I do. That's just the way I live. And so I'm not angry at anybody about it. Chip's still going to be my friend.</p><p><b>Lizza: President Biden told CNN that if Israel invades Rafah, the U.S. will stop supplying it with artillery shells and other offensive weapons. His quote was, “If they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons.” Very, very clear. What's your view of that?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I was informed about that about 10 minutes before I walked in this room. And my reaction honestly, was, “Wow.” That is a complete turn from what I have been told, even in recent hours. I mean, 24 hours ago, it was confirmed to me by top administration officials that the policy's very different than what he stated there. So I hope that's a senior moment.</p><p><b>Lizza: Wait, can you just explain that?</b></p><p>I was in the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/what-scif-who-uses-it-n743991" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;SCIF having classified discussions&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/what-scif-who-uses-it-n743991&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfed0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfed0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">SCIF having classified discussions</a> with some top administration officials. The subject matter of my concern, I can tell you, was we got word about <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/us-concerns-over-israels-gaza-policy-led-to-weapons-holdup-00156528" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the shipment of munitions being delayed&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/us-concerns-over-israels-gaza-policy-led-to-weapons-holdup-00156528&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfed0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfed0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the shipment of munitions being delayed</a>. And that was a great concern to us because I got commitments from top administration officials before we passed the supplemental package for the aid to Israel that that would not happen. And there would be no delay whatsoever. They repeat it to me in writing and verbally, no delay in the delivery of weapons to Israel because it's so desperately needed.</p><p>So yesterday I talked with Prime Minister Netanyahu about it, and I wanted to get confirmation from him exactly what's happening. And he described exactly what was happening — before the news was confirmed.</p><p><b>Lizza: Before Biden’s statement?</b></p><p>Well, this is well before the statement. We were just hearing rumors [about the delayed munitions]. So I confirmed it with Prime Minister Netanyahu. And then I went straight to the White House and I said, ”What gives? Somebody's going to have to explain this to me because it's very different than what I was told.”</p><p>And they said, “Oh, this has nothing to do with the supplemental package that you all passed. This is the earlier weapons tranches.” “Well, Israel needs it right now.” “Well we're working on that.” “Well you better work on it quickly.”</p><p>So this statement by the president, I hope — I believe he's off script. I don't think that's something that staff told him to say. I hope it's a senior moment because that would be a great deviation in what is said to be the policy there and in the very critical relationship we have with Israel.</p><p><b>Lizza: Do you feel betrayed by this then?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I got to say that I do. We've been very deliberate. We've been very open, very much in good faith. The Congress expressed its will through that vote. And so for the administration to make such a huge deviation in policy without any consultation with us and in defiance of what we quite literally just voted on here, days ago. To me, it raises a lot of alarm.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/6a/73/4058cdff445688d2aeadb8bb169a/u-s-congress-57021.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Bade: A lot of your Republican colleagues say that they find Biden to be senile. You've talked a lot with him through these negotiations. Do you agree with that?</b></p><p>I don't know if I'm in any position to diagnose his mental acuity. But look, I will say, it's not personal, but everyone ages differently. It's physiology or what have you. Everybody's different. My father-in-law is the same age as Joe Biden, and he acts as though he's 20 years younger. He's vibrant, he works long days, he still runs his business that he's been running for many years. He's on his A-game.</p><p>To be candid, I don't believe President Biden is. And it concerns me deeply. I take no pleasure in saying that because I think it's a dangerous thing for the country. I think that our adversaries see him in the same way that many Americans do. And I think that's a very dangerous thing for us right now, because that's why our adversaries are acting so provocatively. I believe in Reagan's principles. He reminded us that we maintain peace through strength. And if America doesn't project strength, it's a great concern to free people around the world. And you see the results.</p><p><b>Bade: What gives you the impression that Biden has lost a step a little bit with age?</b></p><p>You know, I don't want to violate any personal confidences or anything, but I've had private conversations with him, of course. But you don't need to rely upon my reflection of a private conversation. You can see him in public, in his public statements. And it's important.</p><p><b>Lizza: One more thing about President Biden. </b><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/biden-federal-funds-spending-tracking" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;b>POLITICO reported in a very important investigation&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/biden-federal-funds-spending-tracking&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfed0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfed0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>POLITICO reported in a very important investigation</b></a><b> that billions of dollars from Biden's four big 2021 and 2022 legislative packages remain unspent. Have you thought about clawing back that unspent money from those four bills, and what you might spend it on?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Well, the principle of clawing back unspent dollars is an easy yes. But of course the devil's in the details. I'm not sure what categories those are, what accounts they're in, what it was dedicated for. If we have the ability to claw it back, we could certainly use that money.</p><p>Right now, we've got $35.5 trillion in federal debt. And we're working every day on restoring the principles of fiscal sanity here. One of the things we're trying to do, for example, is break up the governance by omnibus. We got a first stab at it. We broke the last spending package into two minibuses. And now we're going to actually endeavor to do 12 separate appropriations bills for fiscal year 2025.</p><p><b>Bade: How are you going to do that when a bunch of your members are sinking rules left and right? You weren't able to do all 12 bills last time. What makes you think you can this year?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Well, the reason I'm such an optimist about this is because I handle this situation and this challenge like every other. We're going to set up listening sessions when we get back next week to have everybody come in. We'll begin with the topline spending numbers, build consensus on that.</p><p>We're going to do something that's also innovative: We're going to start with an actual number that everybody can agree to on the front end, not waste time negotiating that. Then the appropriators can begin their process, methodically taking each of the bills, working that through the committee process.</p><p>I met with <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/20/grow-up-a-veteran-republican-is-tired-of-his-partys-insurgents-00153454" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Tom Cole&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/20/grow-up-a-veteran-republican-is-tired-of-his-partys-insurgents-00153454&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfed0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfed0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Tom Cole</a>, who's our Appropriations chair, and he says, “We can do that.” We can produce those bills by the end of the summer and get them ready for movement on the floor. We'd like to do that and get it through the House and send it over to the Senate, and then dare Chuck Schumer not to do his job. I think that that would be fun for the House to jam the Senate for a change.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Bade: Tom Cole said that you were going to mark up the bills at the levels that have already been negotiated with Democrats, not try to do this thing that McCarthy did, where you cut like $100 billion or some such. Again, you think conservatives are going to vote for appropriations bills at that level?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Well, I can tell you, I've talked to a number of House Freedom Caucus members, Chip Roy and others, and many of them have already said it’s the number that was already negotiated. I think it's $1.606 or $1.621 trillion.</p><p>But there is a number that everyone has already agreed to. The thing that people rejected last time was the so-called “side deals” and “gimmicks” and all the other stuff on the outside.</p><p><b>Lizza: We want to ask you about some of your fellow leaders in Congress. Let's start with Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader. Like you, he's a religious man. Have you gotten to know Jeffries as a brother in Christ?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I have. Hakeem is a good man. We’ve worked well together. We have a lot more in common than people might think. You know, he's from New York and I'm from Louisiana. While we have lots of disagreements on policies and the fine points of policy, I think you can appreciate people for who they are as a person. I think that's what we're called to do. And he and I both kind of share the worldview on that. I can appreciate that he's a good family man. We have a lot in common in that regard. And he lost his father recently, I lost mine three days before I got elected to Congress. We've talked about that.</p><p>We've talked about how he and I both came to our leadership positions in a rather circuitous fashion that neither of us predicted or expected, in terms of timing and how we would be elevated as we were. He's been here a little bit longer than I have been. But, there are things that we have in common.</p><p>And I think what we've appreciated about one another is that I believe that when Hakeem Jeffries is telling me something, I believe he's telling me the truth. I believe he is a man of his word. And I think he believes that about me as well. That's a big thing in Washington. You know, trust is a rare commodity around here.</p><p>While we don't agree on many things, it's really refreshing to sit across the table from someone who is your political adversary and know that they're shooting straight. I wish that we could have a lot more of that around here because it would solve a lot of problems. Look, I'm a Reagan Republican. I love the way he did the job. He was a happy warrior, you know?</p><p>He was a hero to all of us. I think to all Republicans, he's still the standard-bearer. And the reason is because of the way he did the job. He's very principled. But he didn't hate anybody, right?</p><p>Reagan and [Democratic Speaker] Tip O'Neill famously had this great relationship. And after his assassination attempt, Tip O'Neill goes to the hospital and kisses him on the forehead. They didn't agree on almost anything, but they had respect for one another. And I think we’ve got to get back to that. I think America needs more of that.</p><p>The person on the other side of the aisle is not an enemy. They're a fellow American. Our enemies are like Hamas and Hezbollah and the people who are trying to kill us. These are our political adversaries. The Founders anticipated that you have people with very different philosophical ideas, very different principles and ideas about government, but we would come here, sit around a table and arm wrestle together and kind of get to a point of consensus so that we can govern the country. This system doesn't work unless you understand the principles that undergird it. And I think restoring those principles is really important for this institution to endure.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/bc/7e/3c0e7eed4866be32b9cfe6b4694c/house-of-representatives-61396.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Bade: You talk about Republicans you admire. Let's talk about a more controversial Republican leader: Kevin McCarthy. When you were elected speaker, did he ever call you and offer any advice? Did you ever seek his counsel?&#xa0;</b></p><p>He did early on. Look, I was on the leadership team under Speaker McCarthy. I was the vice chairman of the House Republican Conference. It’s the No. 6 leadership position. It was funny because when I became speaker, it was like “Who is this mysterious man?” I was like, “I've been on leadership for three years. You guys didn't know what the vice chairman of the Republican conference is? Come on.”</p><p>It was meaningless, but I was on the team. I was at the table, and I was trying to help advance the agenda. And, you know, Kevin was good to me. It was a very painful thing that happened to him. I mean, it was an unprecedented thing. Vacating the chair was devastating to all of us, and it was like being part of a traumatic experience that lasted and endured for too long.</p><p>There was a lot of pain for him personally, I'm sure, that came out of that. But in spite of that, I spoke at his farewell party that they threw for him, this big gathering a couple weeks later. He reached out multiple times in the beginning to offer assistance and try to help. To his credit, you know, that was a tough thing. It's a tough thing. And he knew that I had no ulterior motive. I was never involved in trying to remove him or anything. I think we still have that mutual respect.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/e1/94/89e160fa4df9904170cfb26ebd28/mag-lizza-deepdive-johnson-015.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Bade: Where do you think McCarthy went wrong as speaker? And what are you doing to make sure you don't fall into those traps?&#xa0;</b></p><p>It's not my place to judge my predecessor. I think because our margin was so small and Kevin had such a difficult time obtaining the gavel in the first place — we went 15 rounds right before he was elected speaker — he had a challenge from day one, and when they reduced the motion to vacate threshold to one, it was always a sword of Damocles hanging over his head.</p><p>So I have a lot of sympathy for Kevin or anybody who serves in a position like this at a time like this. With all those factors, it's extremely difficult to do and to navigate those tough waters. I think history will record that he did the best he could under the circumstances. And that's exactly what I'm trying to do every day.</p><p><b>Lizza: It's interesting to hear you talk about bipartisanship and this respect for the famous relationship that Reagan and Tip O'Neill had. We're not really living in those times these days, obviously.</b></p><p><b>One of the biggest sources of friction in the country is the aftermath of the 2020 election and January 6th. Do you have any regrets about the role that you played after the 2020 presidential election, including the amicus brief in support of Texas' lawsuit challenging the election results?&#xa0;</b></p><p>No, I don't. My point in the amicus brief — people often ask me about this and they never read the brief — was a very simple and very profoundly important legal question. And that is, was the plain language of the Constitution violated in the days that led up to the 2020 election? And it very clearly was, because the language of the Constitution says plainly the state legislatures are the bodies in each of the states that determine the process by which electors are chosen. In a presidential election year, it's a critically important thing.</p><p>The operative language there is “state legislatures.” It doesn't mean election officials, secretaries of state, governors or any other body. And what happened because of Covid was everything was different. Everything was irregular. Some in good faith, and others not in such good faith, began to act at state levels to change their laws. They thought, “This is a presidential election year. How will people vote? Well, maybe we should do mail-in ballots to every voter in the state. Maybe we should put unmanned drop boxes in public parks for people to drop off their ballots. Maybe we should do all these things.”</p><p>Some of that was well-intended, perhaps. But the problem is, none of that was ratified by state legislatures because the legislatures weren't meeting and they don't do proxy voting. By extension, that clearly violated the plain language of the Constitution.</p><p>Now remember my background as a constitutional law attorney. For 20 years, I litigated constitutional questions in the courts. And to me, this was just such a plain and very important question to be answered. The only mechanism we had to present that to the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court, was to attach it along to that Texas case that was going to be before the court. That's why the amicus brief was filed there. The Supreme Court dodged the question. Perhaps they calculated that the answer was so profound, it would be so unsettling, and it was not worth them addressing, but well.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/4e/2e/f1bc0daf4db5abad3352ea40b815/house-speakership-election-27457.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Lizza: There was also a question of whether there was a remedy.&#xa0;</b></p><p>Maybe so. But listen, I think fidelity to the Constitution, even in difficult times, is critically important for us. And I thought that was an important question to pose to the court. And so you asked me if I regret that? I don't. I would do the exact same thing today if the circumstances were presented, because I feel like I have a duty. I'm an officer of the Congress and I have a responsibility. We take an oath to uphold the Constitution, and if it's plainly on its face not being followed, I have an obligation as an officer of this body to present that to the judicial branch.</p><p><b>Lizza: So if you were speaker on January 6, 2021, would you have done anything differently?</b></p><p>I don't know. I've never thought — I've never tried to assess that. That was an unprecedented moment at a very difficult time in the country. I'm not sure what I would have done at that point.</p><p><b>Lizza: Some like lightning round questions: Do you anticipate putting forward any legislation on abortion before the election?</b></p><p>No.</p><p><b>Bade: If there is Republican control of both chambers of Congress and the White House next year, do you anticipate passing any sort of nationwide abortion ban?</b></p><p>No, I don't.</p><p>President Trump said this is in the states' purview now. After the <i>Dobbs</i> decision, I think that's where it is. Look, I am a lifelong pro-lifer. I'm a product of a teen pregnancy. And so I believe in the sanctity of human life. It's also an important article of faith for me. But I have 434 colleagues here. All of us have our own, philosophical principles that we live by, but you have to have a political consensus.</p><p>[Andrew] Breitbart said, politics is downstream from culture. He's right. Before you can have political consensus on a very contentious issue like this, you have to have cultural consensus. And I think there's a lot of work to do to build a culture of life and educate people on the importance of that and to really live up to the principles of our nation's birth certificate, which is the declaration that “all men are created equal.” And there's value in that. But we have a long way to go to build the political consensus here to do anything in that regard.</p><p><b>Lizza<i>:</i> Do you think the president should have absolute immunity from prosecution?</b></p><p>Which president?

And we need the person, having given them that trust, to be able to make critical decisions on a dime without worrying about some sort of liability for it. I think that's a really important principle.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/d8/fd/64f1237844e2b9e8f4dc31baf93f/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2148449320" /><br /><p><b>Lizza: As a constitutional scholar yourself?</b></p><p>Look, it's not a question I've wrestled with. I might write you a long dissertation on it, give me some time to think it through. But I think as a general premise, I think it makes sense to most people. I think it's common sense that you can't have the president sitting in the Oval Office worried about whether some lawyer or some local D.A. somewhere is going to go after him. It'd be a serious problem.</p><p><b>Lizza: This is going to be one of the strangest segues ever, but you were a high school thespian, and you're well known for your political impersonations. What is your best impersonation of a politician?</b></p><p>I do some Trump. I do some Clay Higgins, my colleague down from Louisiana.</p><p><b>Lizza: Let's hear the Trump.</b></p><p><i>[As Trump:] </i>You don't want to hear that. You don't want to hear that today, okay? Because Mike is straight out of central casting. You do want to hear that. He's a good speaker of the House. I've liked him.</p><p><b>Lizza: Have you done it for him?</b></p><p>I don't know if I have done it for him. I've done it for a lot of other people. Look, imitation is the greatest form of flattery.</p><p><b>Lizza: Do you feel like he's got enough of a sense of humor that he would be okay?</b></p><p>Oh, yeah. No, he would laugh. We have a good time together. I think he'd be flattered by it. People love that. It humanizes him. And I think he's got thick skin.</p><p><b>Lizza: You think Donald Trump has thick skin?</b></p><p>I do, I really do.</p><p><b>Lizza: I mean, of all the things about Donald Trump, I don't think anyone's ever accused him of having thick skin.</b></p><p>They're not assessing what he's been enduring. I've been taking arrows here for six months. Donald Trump has taken nuclear incoming every single day since he came down the golden staircase. I mean, you can't say that guy's not tough as nails. No one else could endure what he has had to endure. Nobody.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/69/d6/fc1ac97443a4b1c9be74cc0de7fb/mag-lizza-deepdive-johnson-014.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Bade: Let's talk about a future Speaker Johnson.

Jerry Nadler&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/05/04/jerry-nadler-antisemitism-bill-00156105&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfee0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfee0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>Rep. Jerry Nadler</b></a><b>. His question was: What do you think is the future of democracy in this country?</b></p><p>I am very bullish on the future. I genuinely believe what Reagan said. Actually, Lincoln said it first. But Reagan reminded us that we are the last, best hope of man on the earth, this constitutional republic, that we have a grand experiment on the world stage. We turn 248 years old on July 4th. It's a big birthday for us. We’re coming up on 250 years. That is about the average lifespan of many great societies and cultures and we're coming to a moment. Doctor Os Guinness is an author friend of mine, and he wrote a book.</p><p><b>Lizza: You had him on your podcast.</b></p><p>I did. He's brilliant. He says that there comes a moment in a great society, a civilizational moment, where the people have to decide whether they are going to tie themselves in again to the founding principles that made that great society, or they're going to jettison that in exchange for something else. And he makes the point that over history, every time the jettison has happened, it's destroyed the culture. We have to make that decision now.</p><p><b>Lizza: On one of those podcasts, you noted that Trumpism was <i>necessary</i>, but that you were also concerned about what is being lost from traditional conservatism. What do you think is being lost?&#xa0;</b></p><p>So in 2019, I got elected to be chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the largest caucus of conservatives in Congress. At that time, we had 158 members. All the self-described conservatives in the House are part of that group. And so I stood in front of my peers and I said, gee, thanks for making me the chair. Here's what I want to posit to you all. This is 2019, two years into the Trump administration. It was a tumultuous time in the country for lots of reasons. And I felt like a lot of people back home and some of my own colleagues in the building, we were losing our sense of who we are. Like, what does it mean to be an American conservative?</p><p>I said, y'all forgive me. I'm from Louisiana. Everything's explained in either a football or hurricane metaphor. But using the hurricane metaphor, we're in uncharted waters. We feel like we've lost the rudder and we're afloat on this tumultuous sea.</p><p>I think if we created a working group to come up with a definition of American conservatism today, I think it would come down to a simple list. Today I would posit what I call the seven core principles of American conservatism. I said, I think it boils down to this: individual freedom, limited government, the rule of law, peace through strength, fiscal responsibility, free markets and human dignity. We need to be able to speak with greater clarity, conviction and consistency right now than we ever have, because people need answers and we can't go out and just say what we're against; we have to say we're for. I call them the core principles of American conservatism, but I actually think they’re the core principles of America. I think that's the reason that we became the great nation that we are, and I think we're losing it.</p><p><b>Lizza: That's not Trump's list though.&#xa0;</b></p><p>I think he's pursuing most of those principles. I really do. Now, he might define it differently — as many, many colleagues and conservatives do.</p><p>We have people in the building who have disdain for those founding principles. I mean openly, they would rather trade those for something else. They envision that we should be some sort of European-style socialist utopia or something. I believe that's a fool's errand. And so my job every day is to, in the most winsome way I can, be a happy warrior, as Reagan envisioned, to try to advance and advocate for those core principles that I think are going to help us save the Republic.</p><p><b>Lizza: What do you want us to ask our next guest?</b></p><p>How about, what makes you proud to be an American? That's a good one.</p><p><b>Lizza: What's your answer?</b></p><p>The idea that we do live in the greatest country in the history of the world. I don't even think it's close. And I don't have any problem defending that. You know, I'm a lawyer. And if you gave me time, I’d put on my full case to prove it.</p><p><i>Listen to this episode of Playbook Deep Dive on </i><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;i>Apple&lt;/i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfee0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfee0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>Apple</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0YmkWN5cyxuqBh5Vl78yGp?si=2efebaede0b8453e" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;i>Spotify&lt;/i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/0YmkWN5cyxuqBh5Vl78yGp?si=2efebaede0b8453e&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfee0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcfee0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>Spotify</i></a><i>, or wherever you get your podcasts.</i><br /></p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

On Tuesday and Thursday, the former president was forced to sit and listen to explosive and at times lewd testimony from Stormy Daniels, who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/trump-hush-money-trial-stormy-daniels-testimony-00156744" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;described in some detail the sex that they had&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/trump-hush-money-trial-stormy-daniels-testimony-00156744&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcff60002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcff60003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">described in some detail the sex that they had</a>. Trump defense attorney Susan Necheles also brought up some of Daniels’ former public insults directed towards Trump, sure to make the former president’s blood boil, including “<a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/07/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/daniels-spars-with-necheles-00156649" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;I don’t owe him shit and I’ll never give that orange turd a dime&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/07/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/daniels-spars-with-necheles-00156649&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcff60004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcff60005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">I don’t owe him shit and I’ll never give that orange turd a dime</a>.”</p><p>While sitting through testimony from Daniels that sounded at times designed to humiliate him — Necheles at one point brought up Daniels’ comments that when she saw Trump in his underwear she almost fainted — Trump was visibly huffing and puffing, shaking his head, and shifting in his seat.

Since he burst onto the political scene, Trump’s appeal to Republicans was precisely his attack dog mentality — leave no slight unpunished, no rival unbruised, and always exact revenge. In his 2007 book “Think Big,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/330325949847597056" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;explained his first rule of business&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/330325949847597056&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcff6000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcff6000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">explained his first rule of business</a>: “Always get even. When you are in business, you need to get even with people who screw you.”</p><p>Charting his political career, it’s easy to see that mentality playing out in real time. He’s purged the Republican Party of his detractors, insulted and disparaged his skeptics, and driven out of office some of the GOP’s most prominent politicians. Of the ten House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after Jan. 6, only two remain in Congress — in no small part due to his efforts.</p><p>Trump’s scorched earth strategy has made him one of the most polarizing presidents ever to hold office, but it’s also propelled the unshakable loyalty that many of his supporters have for him.

Not on social media, where she’s quick to clap back at ugly memes and derogatory jabs. And not in a courtroom, where, on a witness stand in Donald Trump’s hush money trial this week, she proudly described her pornography career, defended herself from charges of money-grubbing and deflected criticism of a strip club tour called “Make America Horny Again.”</p><p>Sex scandals have come a long way since the Bill Clinton days.</p><p>That’s a major takeaway from this week’s courtroom spectacle, when Daniels calmly testified about hotel room dalliances and sexual positions and the clumsy come-ons from a future U.S. president — and the media took copious notes. In some ways, the excitement around the trial was a throwback to the political and legal scandals of the 1990s, when Clinton’s alleged sexual harassment and illicit affairs led to lawsuits, investigations and impeachment. Then, as now, there was breathless interest from the press, aw-shucks reporting of salacious details, palpable glee from late-night comedians.</p><p>But there’s also a crucial difference. The women at the center of the 1990s scandals, Paula Jones, who sued Clinton for sexual harassment in the mid-1990s, and Monica Lewinsky, the intern at the center of Clinton’s impeachment, were mocked and belittled, frequently dismissed, dragged unwittingly into the arena and left to suffer there alone. At one memorable point in the saga, Jones broke down crying at a press conference; the spotlight was too harsh, the pressure was too much.</p><p>At Trump’s trial, it was his longtime aide Hope Hicks who sobbed under pressure on the witness stand. Daniels, the woman with the bedroom stories, seemed unfazed. That says something about her own personality: confident, defiant, sex-positive. But it also says something about a culture that gives her more freedom to present herself that way — and the tools to push back at her detractors.</p><p>Anyone who lived through the Clinton scandals remembers the deep unkindness to the women at their center, and the power dynamics that made the cruelty possible. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB899939190484772500" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;A 1998&#xa0;&lt;i>Wall Street Journal&lt;/i>&#xa0;editorial called Lewinsky a “little tart.”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB899939190484772500&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcffb0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcffb0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">A 1998&#xa0;<i>Wall Street Journal</i>&#xa0;editorial called Lewinsky a “little tart.”</a> Men with late-night television megaphones mocked Lewinsky’s weight and Jones’ nose. Men at the center of politics made dismissive statements that revealed as much class snobbery as misogyny: James Carville famously said of Jones, “Drag a hundred-dollar bill through a trailer park, you never know what you’ll find.”</p><p>Today, Trump’s defense attorneys are using the same playbook to try to neutralize Daniels’ testimony, arguing that she was an unsavory character, looking for extortion money, when she took a $130,000 payment for hiding her story. But Daniels cuts a decidedly different figure. She’s older, for one, and battle-tested. But she’s also far less capable of being shamed. Her long career in the adult film industry, where she rose from actress to director and impresario, inoculates her from much of the knee-jerk derision. It also gives her a sense of agency that Lewinsky and Jones never had, and the freedom to push back at old slut-shaming tropes. In the courtroom on Thursday, when Trump’s defense attorney took a backhanded jab at Daniels’ career —"So you have a lot of experience making phony stories about sex appear real?" — Daniels had a quick, unbothered reply. “The sex is real,” she said. "That's why it’s pornography."<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352362261112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>That perfunctory defiance helps explain why, while Daniels has been at center of late-night jokes this week, she’s seldom been the butt of them. On “The Daily Show,” host Jordan Klepper focused on Trump himself and the media’s oddball fascination: “You’re very prudish for people whose names sound like porn names,” he said, after playing a clip of CNN’s Dana Bash and Jake Tapper, acting like the trial coverage made them squeamish. On ABC, Jimmy Kimmel focused on the circus itself: “The judge said Stormy could testify about her sexual relationship with Trump, but also said, ‘We don’t need to know the details.’ … Yes, we do need to know the details. Some of us are trying to host a show here, OK?” (Daniels’ Thursday testimony about a paranormal reality show and a supposedly-haunted house that was actually occupied by a possum might provide a <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/weird/paranormal-possum-cnns-entire-coverage-team-wheezes-with-laughter-at-bizarre-turn-in-trump-stormy-daniels-cross/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;fresh round of fodder&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.mediaite.com/weird/paranormal-possum-cnns-entire-coverage-team-wheezes-with-laughter-at-bizarre-turn-in-trump-stormy-daniels-cross/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcffb0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcffb0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">fresh round of fodder</a>, but it won’t be about sex.)</p><p>It's fair to wonder whether the mainstream media would be so credulous of Daniels, or so relatively kind, if someone other than Trump were on trial. Indeed, some of Trump’s right-wing media defenders have been less hesitant to challenge Daniels’ credibility. On Fox News this week, the female host Kennedy made an old-school jab: “Her being surprised that she was going to a hotel room alone with a man to have body congress is like Pete Sampras being surprised at being invited to a tennis court and you want to see his serve.”</p><p>Still, it’s clear that, for many outlets, the ground rules around covering sexual dynamics have changed. The #MeToo scandal shone a light on power differentials and forced some revisionist thinking in the media and beyond — creating possibilities that never existed in the 1990s, says <a href="https://www.leoratanenbaum.com/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715300046493,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715300046493,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.leoratanenbaum.com/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fd9-dcc8-addf-dfdf7dc50001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Leora Tanenbaum&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fd9-dcc8-addf-dfdf7dc50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Leora Tanenbaum</a>, an expert on slut-shaming whose books include “SLUT! Growing up Female with a Bad Reputation.”</p><p>Back then, “we didn’t even have the language to describe being trashed as a result of the sexual double standard,” Tanenbaum wrote in an email. “It was normalized to hold the mindset that boys will be boys — and girls will be sluts. As a result, there’s nothing these women could have done differently at the time to be taken seriously.”<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352592873112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>This shift has no doubt been aided by other changes in the past few decades — for one, social media. It takes a fair amount of fortitude to play in an arena where body-shaming and generalized cruelty are still the standard currency, but Daniels uses her accounts with confidence, honing her straight-shooting persona and pushing back at critics who want to reduce her to sexist tropes. When someone recently wrote on X, “it’s crazy your greatest life achievement is fornication with a married man,” <a href="https://twitter.com/StormyDaniels/status/1778835726513102990" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Daniels shot back&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/StormyDaniels/status/1778835726513102990&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcffc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcffc0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Daniels shot back</a>, “True! He was married to me and the achievement is our daughter.” If Jones and Lewinsky had had the power to correct rumors in real time, and speak in their own voices, one wonders how different the ’90s would have been.</p><p>Still, Tanenbaum cautions against claiming too much progress. There’s still a double standard, she contends, when it comes to women talking about sex: When Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion performed their explicit song “WAP” at the 2021 Grammy Awards, the Federal Communications Commission received over 1,000 complaints. And Tanenbaum takes issue with the media for always identifying Daniels as a “porn star” or “adult film actress,” which she says conditions readers to think she can’t be taken seriously. “Her profession is not relevant at all to this criminal trial unless you believe that women who work in the sex industry are untrustworthy,” Tanenbaum says.</p><p>But there are signs that, as it works through every angle of the Trump trial story, the press is treating adult film workers with a newfound respect. On CNN on Tuesday, Tapper conducted a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/justice/2024/05/08/the-lead-alana-evans-stormy-daniels-testimony-trump-trial-jake-tapper.cnn" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;strikingly conventional interview&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/justice/2024/05/08/the-lead-alana-evans-stormy-daniels-testimony-trump-trial-jake-tapper.cnn&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcffc0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dcffc0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">strikingly conventional interview</a> with another porn actress, Alana Evans, who had been at Lake Tahoe around the time of Daniels’ first encounter with Trump. There was no indication that it was anything but an ordinary chat with an ordinary cable news guest.</p><p>More broadly, in the political world, people from unlikely corners are starting to push back against the stigmas around women and sex.

Then came the prosecutors’ most notable and attention-grabbing witness to date — the former adult film star <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/stormy-daniels-testify-trump-trial-00156522" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Stormy Daniels&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/stormy-daniels-testify-trump-trial-00156522&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0040002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0040003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Stormy Daniels</a>. It was a remarkable and distinctly awkward affair for the former president, who sat through hours of detailed and embarrassing testimony about their alleged extramarital sexual relationship.</p><p>But thanks to the absence of cameras in the courtroom — and despite the wall-to-wall coverage — there’s much that remains unclear to those of us on the outside, regarding Daniels and much else. So we convened the second in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/25/trump-trial-politico-reporter-conversation-00153671" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a series of roundtable&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/25/trump-trial-politico-reporter-conversation-00153671&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0040004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0040005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a series of roundtable</a> discussions with a group of POLITICO’s legal and political reporters to take readers behind the scenes of the courtroom and the Trump campaign.</p><p>We were joined by Ben Feuerherd, who has been in the courtroom and in the courthouse every day of the trial covering this historic proceeding; Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney, who have been closely following and reporting on Trump’s legal travails for years; and Meridith McGraw, who has been covering the Trump reelection campaign while the candidate spends four days a week on trial in a Manhattan courtroom.</p><p>With the trial roughly halfway through, it was also an opportunity to discuss some surprising turns, including where the prosecution and the defense may have scored some real points before the jury.</p><p><i>This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p><br /><p><b>Ben, Stormy Daniels took the stand on Tuesday and will appear again on Thursday. The timing of her testimony was a surprise to those of us on the outside. What was the scene like in the courtroom and the courthouse when this news started to make the rounds?</b></p><p><b>Feuerherd: </b>To start the day, things were at a fever pitch, because Monday left off with Trump in the hallway basically saying, “I’ll go to jail. I’ll violate the gag order.” Then before he even arrived at court, he sent a message on Truth Social that appeared to address a witness taking the stand. I was waiting: “Could this be the day where Trump walks out in the hallway and breaks the gag order to put the ball in the judge’s court?”</p><p>All the drama on Tuesday was in the courtroom, not outside the courtroom. It was a stark difference from Monday, where the testimony was kind of dry yet important to the prosecution, but all the drama was seemingly playing outside with Trump’s comments about the gag order.</p><p><b>Josh, you were in the courtroom Tuesday. Can you just talk about what the reaction was among the jurors during Daniels’ testimony? You reported that at least one juror put her hand to her head and looked away. Can you talk a little bit about that, and what you saw from the whole panel of jurors? &#xa0;</b></p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>As Ben mentioned, on Monday, they seemed kind of bored. I think anybody would be by the time you’re going through the ninth, 10th or 11th monthly invoice for some kind of payment. The witnesses that they had on Monday were not the most electric ones you’re ever going to see on the witness stand. Bookkeepers and corporate controllers don’t tend to really color outside the lines, so people looked a little bit bored, which is not to say they weren’t paying attention. I’ve covered a lot of trials, and when jurors are not paying attention or actually nodding off, you see that, and that wasn’t happening, although some of them were staring around looking out at the gallery and the press corps.</p><br /><p>As we moved into Tuesday, after Stormy Daniels had come in and taken the stand, which was a dramatic entry — not that anything that exciting or flashy happened — they were really, really focused on her, and I think the jurors understood that she’s sort of the central figure of the case, at least in the pop culture assessment of it. I’m not sure that she’s the central figure in that case legally.</p><p>She’s become a larger-than-life figure, and I think people treated her that way. The thing you’re alluding to — I think it wasn’t that people were uncomfortable through the entire testimony, but it was certain details that she shared at different points about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump that got into some of the nitty gritty that the judge later said, “You know, I think some things were probably said that didn’t need to be said.”</p><p>That was when I saw some jurors kind of cringing or smiling a little bit awkwardly — and one kind of looking away and put her hand on her forehead — so there was some discomfort with some of the more tawdry aspects. If anybody was dozing off during that particular exchange, they would have been quickly woken because there was a flurry of action back and forth, as Trump’s lawyers naturally objected to many of those things being put on the record in this trial.</p><p><b>What was it that exactly frustrated the judge? There were a couple of lines in Daniels’ testimony that implied that their encounter may not have been consensual, when she said she blacked out. Ironically, that testimony or that allusion is much more prejudicial against Trump than the normal defendant because he has actually </b><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/05/09/verdict-trump-sexual-assault-trial-00096039" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;b>sexually abused women in non-consensual ways&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/05/09/verdict-trump-sexual-assault-trial-00096039&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0040006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0040007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>sexually abused women in non-consensual ways</b></a><b> before, so I get the judge’s concern on that front.</b></p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>The judge didn’t really explain that, but I think going into the hearing, he had made clear that he didn’t think that there needed to be a lot of detail provided. The facts that came out — at one point, she said, “This was missionary position,” or there was a question about whether he used a condom and things like that.</p><p>Now, these are things that she has already talked about in interviews. For goodness sake, she wrote a book about it, right? So this stuff is out there, but to have her say it in Trump’s physical presence was obviously a new thing.</p><p>I think the thing you mentioned, Ankush, was a big part of it. This notion that the sex might have not been consensual.</p><p>She has been pretty clear in her previous accounts. Some people have said, “Oh, it sounds like you were date raped, or sexually assaulted by Trump.” And I know of previous interviews where Daniels said, “I’m not saying that that’s what happened.” It may have just been her nervousness and word choice going from saying, “I don’t have a clear memory of everything that happened that night” versus saying, “I blacked out,” which then you start thinking, you know, is this a Bill Cosby kind of thing?</p><p><b>Well, you also might start thinking, “Is it a Donald Trump thing?”</b></p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>That’s a problem. I do also think the judge felt that while it was OK to talk about the encounter, that this really should not be a trial about that encounter. It’s not a sexual assault trial. It’s a trial about something else.</p><p>I think you can actually argue that it shouldn’t matter much for the outcome of his case whether this event happened the way Stormy Daniels described it or not, or to some extent whether it may not have happened at all. I don’t really quite see how that figures entirely into the merits of the case.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Can I offer you my own two cents on that? There is definitely a way that the prosecutors could have put on this case without having to take a position on whether this encounter actually happened, but there are several problems with that.</b></p><p><b>First, Trump has denied it repeatedly for years, and Trump’s lawyer repeated the denial in his opening statement, so if you’re the prosecutors, and this is part of the story, you absolutely have to prove that it happened, including by having the only other person in the room provide as much detail as possible to shore up their credibility.</b></p><p><b>Also, we’re hearing a lot of pro-Trump spin on Daniels’ testimony — about how it was a disaster, she was irrelevant or whatever. Trump could have preempted this witness — possibly entirely — if he just admitted that the encounter had happened. Smart criminal defenses do sometimes concede unpleasant facts in order to get the jury to focus on the material ones that might actually get the defendant off. Trump himself played an essential role in bringing her to the stand.</b></p><p><b>All that said, what is Trump doing through all of this? What is he physically doing during this very strange testimony?</b></p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>I’ll tell you what I could see, and then Ben can chime in.</p><p>I could see that he wasn’t really looking at Daniels. The way the courtroom is constructed, it’s a little bit odd. I think it’s a bit hard to see the person in the witness box and on the witness stand from the defendant’s table, at least where Trump is sitting. The judge’s bench is kind of in the way.</p><p>There was one moment during the Tuesday proceedings where the prosecutors asked, kind of dramatically, for Daniels to identify Trump, and she had to lean around the judge’s bench and crane her neck a bit and then, you know, pointed at him. Obviously, she had seen him coming into the courtroom; she knew he was there. But she had to do that.</p><p>Trump was making a deliberate effort to not acknowledge her in the courtroom and stare straight ahead. He had the opportunity to see her because there’s a couple different TV monitors that are on the counsel table and elsewhere in the courtroom, so it’s not like he couldn’t see or hear.</p><p>And he had trouble controlling his reactions. There were different times when he started shifting around and seemed to be mumbling, and the judge eventually called him out for that, at least privately.</p><p><b>Feuerherd: </b>The one main thing that I saw and that we’ve reported is that when Daniels was describing rolling up his magazine swatting him on the backside with it, Trump sort of laid back in his chair, and I saw in the feed that he mouthed, “Bullshit.”</p><p>It was later raised at sidebar. The judge talked to Todd Blanche, Trump’s attorney, and said, “Your client is audibly cursing, and that’s contemptuous, and I’m not gonna stand for it.</p><p><b>Meridith, this is now like the third trial in a year in which Trump’s mistreatment of women is really at the heart of the case. We had two E. Jean Carroll trials where he was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation to the tune of nearly $100 million. That was nonconsensual, so there’s a big distinction there.</b></p><p><b>But now we have Trump cheating on his wife with an adult film star. Has any of this dented Trump’s standing with women voters heading into this election?</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>Trump has always had a women problem. We saw that in 2016. He made slight improvements in 2020 with women voters, but there still really is a big gender gap between Trump and President Biden when it comes to women voters. A lot of that has to do with reproductive rights and abortion, which continue to be top of mind for a lot of those more moderate women who might be trying to decide who they’re going to vote for in the upcoming election.</p><p>Some of the suburban women that Trump really has struggled with in the past, when it comes to the E. Jean Carroll case, at least among Republican voters, I don’t think it’s made a huge difference. I think a lot of them have been able to grapple with Trump and his personal issues, warts and all.</p><p>Still, when it comes to Trump’s issue with women in the upcoming election, this does not help.</p><p>You heard Hope Hicks, when she was on the witness stand, say that she didn’t think about the Stormy Daniels issue hurting with women in 2016, but she did think that it could hurt with voters after the fact. So I do think it could be one of many issues that Trump has with women in 2024.</p><p><b>Where is Melania in all of this? She’s been keeping a low profile, but ideally, I would think if you’re running for reelection, your wife — the former first lady — would be a prominent surrogate.</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>Melania continues to be a mystery. Nobody is ever really quite sure how she spends her day. She’s incredibly private and spends a lot of time with her family. Her mother recently died, and Barron Trump is going to be heading off to college.</p><p>We’ve heard from some of her former aides about how she might be taking this. She’s probably watching all of this incredibly closely. The Stormy Daniels affair allegations really bothered her. Obviously, it came right after she gave birth to her son, Barron.<br /></p><br /><p>She’s probably following along with all of this. We’ve only seen her come out on the campaign trail — oh, gosh, the last public appearance she had was at a Log Cabin Republicans event, but it was incredibly small. The campaign has said that we’re going to be seeing more of her at some point, but right now, with the Stormy Daniels headlines, I’m not sure if that’s going to be anytime soon.</p><p><b>Does she believe that this sexual encounter with Daniels happened, or does she have the view that Daniels is making it up?</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>One of her former aides said that Melania Trump is always about the proof, wanting to have ironclad proof for things. She really is a lot like her husband in that she is skeptical and dismissive of the media and critics and anybody who undermines them.</p><p>At the same time, Trump has a longstanding reputation with women that I’m sure Melania Trump is well aware of.</p><p><b>Kyle, the contempt proceedings were another big event this week.

It’s not the first time he’s violated a gag order in one of his legal cases. Do you think he really cannot help himself? Or does he think that this is helpful to him as some sort of legal strategy or political strategy or both?</b></p><p><b>Cheney: </b>I actually think he can help himself. It’s actually a salient point, because when he goes out into the hallway for interviews, he sort of knows where the line is and is strategic about what he says. In many of his social media posts — even the ones that crossed the line — you can sort of see at least some semblance of an effort to find the contours of the gag order and push right up to the limit.</p><p>At times, he clearly has exceeded that limit when he talks about witnesses. And some of them were reposts of others’ posts, which is kind of a novel legal issue. Even Justice Merchan has had to say that this is the first time this has ever been ruled on, but I’m ruling against you.</p><p>So I think he knows the line, and that is salient, because, as Judge Chutkan has said in D.C., he knows exactly how to restrain himself when he’s told to. The gag order actually works in that he doesn’t say things that go so far over the line, but obviously he has trouble finding exactly where that line is.</p><p>I also think that Trump — in a very deep psychological way — does not want to go to jail, even though he thinks it would be a political windfall for him. Also, personally he doesn’t want to be in prison. So I think that he’s of two minds on that, knowing what the good politics is versus his own personal well-being.</p><p><b>McGraw: </b>At the psychological level, he does not want to go to jail. That’s been a fear of his, as Kyle was saying. He does these verbal gymnastics to push him right up against the edge, and the threat of jail is potent enough of a political threat that he hangs over his supporters.</p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>I think he doesn’t want to go. You’ve got to remember, at least before he ran for the presidency, this is a guy whose whole brand is creature comforts. He’s the epitome of what we used to call in the 1980s “champagne wishes and caviar dreams.” He’s not someone who’s going to find himself in jail being very tolerant in those kinds of conditions when he’s used to the more gilded surroundings that he prefers at Trump Tower, down at Mar-a-Lago and so forth.</p><p><b>Cheney: </b>He wants everyone to think that he’s willing to go to jail.</p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>I totally agree with Kyle. He revels in his tough guy image — you know, “This isn’t about me, this is about you, and if I have to take one for the country, I’m going to do that.”</p><p><b>Cheney: </b>Right before we jumped on here, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/trumptweets/comments/1cn39x3/5824_my_free_speech_was_taken_away_its_so_unfair/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;he posted something&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/trumptweets/comments/1cn39x3/5824_my_free_speech_was_taken_away_its_so_unfair/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0050003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0050004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">he posted something</a> saying “give me liberty or give me death” in the context of his gag order, his willingness to defend free speech. He certainly wants the impression out there even though I think he would fight tooth and nail to stay out of prison.</p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>The other thing I would say on that is that we can all think of things he could say that would violate the gag order and land him in jail. As Kyle has been alluding to, he hasn’t said those things yet. That makes me doubt that he’s someone who’s actually eager to spend time behind bars to become a martyr for his cause.</p><p><b>McGraw: </b>He’s a notorious germophobe, too.</p><p><b>Cheney: </b>That’s the psychological part. Exactly.</p><p><b>There’s no hair and makeup in jail, either.</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>No hair and makeup. He can’t control it.</p><p><b>Cheney:</b> Has to wear a jumpsuit.</p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>The coiffe was a little off, by the way, in court this week, since I had a lot of time to look at the back of his head. There was an over-extension on the left side that just was not symmetrical, and I was surprised that that went on for so long.</p><p><b>Feuerherd: </b>We gave him every opportunity to break the gag order — questions that, had he responded to them, arguably he would have broken the gag order. He steered clear of every one of those, but then at the end of the day, he said, “I’m ready to go to jail for the Constitution,” and yet did not respond to any questions that could have broken the gag order.</p><p><b>You know how I know he doesn’t want to go to jail? Josh is right, but a much more simple and efficient way to go to jail if he really meant it would just be to repost the Truth Social posts that got him held in contempt the first time. That’d be quick, easy and clearly in violation of the gag order, and the judge would be angry and would send him to jail. Trump isn’t doing that, which is why I know he doesn’t actually want to go to jail, at least not now.</b></p><p><b>Ben, we’re about halfway through the trial. You have been there every day. Can you talk about where you have seen successes for the prosecution and also for the defense?</b></p><p><b>Feuerherd: </b>The high point for the prosecution probably would have been [former National Enquirer publisher] David Pecker, just laying this foundation for this conspiracy that they allege in a very clear, concise way, discussing meetings in Trump Tower with Michael Cohen and Trump and then walking jurors through the end result of that, which was AMI entering into a non-prosecution agreement that said they broke campaign finance laws. He said, “I thought I was working for the campaign, not to protect Donald Trump’s name.”</p><p>You can make an argument that, for the defense, Hope Hicks painted Trump in a favorable light. She arguably scored some points for prosecutors, but also tried to protect Trump, dirtied Michael Cohen a little bit.</p><p><b>Cheney: </b>That speaks to this this [Harvey] Weinstein issue. His conviction was overturned in part because there was extraneous stuff that was introduced that was prejudicial to the case. There’s certainly not a parallel between these two cases, but you could see the contours of a similar argument here — that it was all this really prejudicial stuff that came in that had nothing to do with the underlying charges. Trump’s at least going to make a run at that if he is convicted.</p><p><b>Meredith, let’s talk about the political theater in the courtroom.</b></p><p><b>Ken Paxton showed up even though he has a full time job in Texas as attorney general. We’ve also had these political people who weren’t there initially but have shown up in the last week or two — Susie Wiles, Boris Epshteyn, Natalie Harp. What should we make of the fact that these political allies are showing up? Are they there to give him an ego boost?</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>I will say with Ken Paxton, he has shown up at all sorts of different Trump events I’ve been at. I think he is often very eager to show Trump just how loyal and with him he is. I have no doubt that that was the calculation with him.</p><p>The other names that you just gave — Susie Wiles, Boris, Natalie Harp, that’s really Trump’s inner circle. These are his top advisers — people who spend a lot of time with him every day — and this trial is a big part of his campaign message. They obviously don’t love the fact that Trump is spending all of his time in court and that this is what people are talking about in the election, but they’ve still tried to say that they’re making lemonade out of lemons with this and really trying to push this as part of their argument that Trump is somehow unfairly targeted.<br /></p><br /><p><br />But there is, of course, just an awareness that this is where we’re at in 2024. This is what the cards are that they’re having to deal with. Politically, they’re having to make this part of their case, whether they want to or not.</p><p><b>Cheney: </b>I actually think that it’s a little surprising there haven’t been more people showing up like Ken Paxton. I think Marjorie Taylor Greene showed up for some of the pretrial stuff.</p><p>Trump values loyalty maybe as his No. 1 attribute, and there’s no better way to show your loyalty than to stand with him in this moment. And yet, as I said, the people who are there — there’s his campaign apparatus, there’s his message apparatus, they would be expected to be with him anyway. It took a while even <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/06/trump-trial-new-york-melania-family-00156189" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;before his own family members&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/06/trump-trial-new-york-melania-family-00156189&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0050005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0050006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">before his own family members</a> showed up.</p><p><b>Meridith, is this trial taking a personal toll on Trump? To my eyes, it does look like he’s a little slumped down in his appearances, even when he’s in front of a camera — not just the pictures and the reporting from within the courtroom.</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>This is — especially Daniels’ testimony — it’s just been embarrassing for him to have all of these personal details out there even though he’s denied it.</p><p>I’m sure these are humiliating details to have talked about every day on the news. His people close to him have said that this is a kind of punishment for him in and of itself — that he obviously is not enjoying any of this. They’ve tried to make a political spectacle out of it, and they’ve tried to have these political events on the sidelines. He’s had sort of spirit-boosting events back at Mar-a-Lago where he’s been surrounded by allies, like when he was at Ronny Jackson’s birthday party this weekend.</p><p>But being in trial, day after day, I’m sure is grueling and taxing. And you see, like you said, physically how it’s impacted him.</p><p><br /></p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

Foreign policy was on the agenda, and the Ford team saw a major opportunity to brush back the former Georgia peanut farmer.</p><p>The biggest issue of the day was the Helsinki Accords, which cemented the post-World War II borders and were intended to ease tensions with the Soviet Union. Ford had come in for criticism that he had ceded too much to the Soviets and was ready when one of the moderators, the<i> New York Times’</i> Max Frankel, raised the charge.</p><p>The Pope endorsed Helsinki, Ford responded (in a bow to the campaign’s conviction that the Catholic vote was key). The whole of the West was behind it. And then, in a rhetorical flourish, he added: “There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration.”</p><p>The Ford campaign staff collectively blanched — National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft literally turned white — but Frankel threw the president a potential lifeline. “Did I understand you to say, sir, that the Russians are not using Eastern Europe as their own sphere of influence in occupying most of the countries there…?”</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/4d/ad/80abfdda4cf6a5a76884247f3717/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary1.jpg" /><br /><p>After asserting, correctly, that Yugoslavia and Romania did not consider themselves dominated, he added, “I don’t believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.” That was a bridge too far — a comment that made the president look delusional and soured key voters in communities filled with Europeans whose families had fled Soviet brutality.</p><p>It was a debate gaffe that arguably cost Ford the election and changed American history. Indeed, not only would there have been no President Jimmy Carter, there might have been no President Ronald Reagan or the conservative revolution he unleashed.</p><p><br /></p><br /><p><b>How did the election</b> get to that point, where such a misstep could tip the balance? Blame Watergate. The candidates might have bristled at the description, but the 1976 presidential campaign was arguably a race between two accidental nominees, both shaped by the fallout from Richard Nixon’s downfall.</p><p>When Ford became president on Aug. 8, 1974, after Nixon resigned, he had never been elected to national or even statewide office. He was the well-liked minority leader of the House when Nixon picked him to replace Spiro Agnew, who’d resigned from the vice presidency one step ahead of the sheriff. The House and Senate confirmed the choice, but the only voters who’d ever chosen him were those of his Grand Rapids, Michigan, congressional district.</p><p>Still, he’d entered the presidency on a wave of good feeling — exuding modesty (“I’m a Ford, not a Lincoln”), fixing his own breakfast and promising cooperation with the big Democratic majorities in Congress. Then things went sideways when he pardoned Nixon in an effort to spare the nation the prospect of an ex-president on trial. His press secretary resigned, his approval ratings sank and then came the more personal assaults. After a few spills, the most athletic president in history — he’d been offered a pro football contract — was portrayed as a bumbling fool, especially on a new late night TV show, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bvxZgCryUE" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;“Saturday Night Live.”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bvxZgCryUE&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd00f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd00f0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">“Saturday Night Live.”</a> The cover of New York Magazine <a href="https://nymag.com/news/politics/46799/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;portrayed him, literally, as a clown&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nymag.com/news/politics/46799/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd00f0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd00f0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">portrayed him, literally, as a clown</a>.</p><p>More importantly, oil price hikes imposed by the OPEC cartel led to rising inflation and painful contractions in the auto industry, as customers sought out more fuel-efficient cars from Japan and Europe. The Ford administration’s lame PR effort — “a Whip Inflation Now” campaign — was met with ridicule. Then came the word from California: Former Gov. Ronald Reagan was going to challenge Ford for the Republican nomination, and Reagan ultimately came within a whisper of making Ford the first president since Chester Arthur to be denied his party’s nomination. When Ford invited Reagan to speak to the convention after his acceptance speech, it was clear who had the firmer grip on the heart and soul of the party.</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/7d/c6/1f85ce454f68ae676394852d2485/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary2.png" /><br /><p>It was Watergate that made Jimmy Carter, that most unlikely of candidates, the nominee of his party as well. Under ordinary circumstances, a former one-term governor from a Southern state who could go unrecognized by 9 out of 10 citizens would be laughed off the political stage (When he announced for president, his hometown paper headlined: “Jimmy Who Is Running for What!?”)</p><p>But after Nixon’s scandal, Carter’s bugs turned out to be features.</p><p>“I’m not from Washington,” he’d proclaimed. For the last four campaigns, every Democratic nominee for president and vice president was or had been a senator. But in this year, to be from somewhere else was to be free from the taint of scandal. (Reagan had the same advantage). Moreover, he was, in demeanor and background, without any trace of privilege or power: a peanut farmer from the ridiculously on-the-mark town of… Plains.</p><p>His campaign had no money, so he stayed at the homes of supporters, carrying his own bags, traveling with an entourage of two. His campaign themes were intensely personal: “I’ll never lie to you,” said the man who called for “a government as good as its people.”</p><p>After the party’s internecine blood baths of 1968 and 1972, Democrats had united, with everyone from Black politicians like Julian Bond and Rep. Andrew Young to the one-time segregationist George Wallace backing him. When the conventions were over, Carter had a 33-point lead over Ford. No wonder the sitting president, in a break with precedent, challenged his rival to debate.</p><p>One of the Ford campaign’s overriding goals was to turn Carter’s sudden emergence from obscurity into a liability, by asking again and again: “Do you really know what he believes in?” As attacks go, it was mild fare. (It was in fact a highly civil campaign, in which the charges of inconsistency were met by Carter calling Ford “a good and decent man” who had not accomplished anything of note in his tenure, though that did not stop journalist Barbara Walters from asking the candidates about “the low moral tone of the campaign.”)</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/0e/c4/947c87cc4c838929d29edd5db885/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary3.jpg" /><br /><p>But the argument began to cut, and at that first debate, Ford’s critique of an inconsistent, vague candidate hit home; when the two met for their second debate at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, Carter’s lead had dropped to single digits.</p><p>And then Ford stepped in it with his flippant remark about Poland and the Soviet Union.</p><p>In that pre-social media era, the backlash built over a couple days until the outrage was widespread, particularly among families of immigrants who loathed the Soviets.</p><p>It took a week for Ford to find his footing on the matter, including by offering an apologetic call to Aloysius Mazewski, president of the Polish‐American Congress — a week that broke the steady improvement in the campaign’s standing.</p><p>How critical was this setback? As Ford pollster Bob Teeter later said, “The controversy used up valuable campaign days when there were all too few left, when a steady climb had to be sustained.”</p><p>Even if it had a marginal impact, that margin would have been enough to change the outcome. Look at the results. Carter beat Ford by 1.7 million popular votes, but the Electoral College couldn’t have been closer.</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/26/e3/7f3a33e1466f9c7d20464ad3429a/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary4.jpg" /><br /><p>In Ohio, with 25 electoral votes — where the families of Catholic immigrants from Eastern Europe formed a significant share of the vote — Carter beat Ford by just 11,000 votes, a third of a percent of the 4 million votes cast. If 6,000 Ohio voters had changed their decision, along with 7,500 Mississippians, Ford would have remained in the White House. It was the narrowest victory in a hundred years, and nothing since has been closer except the 2000 election.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Had Ford held on</b> to the presidency, it would have changed the trajectory of American politics — potentially by denying Reagan his time in the White House.</p><p>Notably, Ford would have won despite losing the popular vote — the first time a popular vote loser won the presidency at that point since Benjamin Harrison in 1888. Ford also would have faced a Congress dominated by the opposition party Democrats, with little mandate to try to bend them to his will.</p><p>Yet as the sitting president, Ford would have been the most visible target for the discontent that the late 1970’s would bring to an America grappling for the first time in decades with structural economic woes.</p><p>Inflation, which had proven impervious to Ford’s “Whip Inflation Now” public relations campaign, grew steadily, fueled by a second “oil shock” that once again led to long gas lines. Ford would have begun his first full term with a 5.2 percent inflation rate; by March of 1978 it had almost doubled, and it stayed in double digits throughout the next two years. That inflation meant trouble in a wide range of fields, from the cost of a mortgage to a new automobile to prices at the supermarket.</p><p>The plummeting approval ratings that hit Jimmy Carter — he was disapproved of by a 54-33 percent margin at the end of 1979 — would likely have befallen Ford as well.</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/e8/0b/ad8823cb46ffbb834b7a7e2471fe/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary5.jpg" /><br /><p>Of course, Ford would have been in a very different position than Carter; having served more than half of Richard Nixon’s second term, Ford would have been ineligible to run again for the presidency in 1980 under the provisions of the 22nd Amendment. It would have fallen to a new candidate to attempt to hold the White House for the Republicans for a fourth consecutive term — something neither party had done (with the exception of the FDR-Truman five-term run) since 1908.</p><p>In 1980, Ronald Reagan could run against the beleaguered Carter administration and the Democrat-dominated Congress by pledging a wholesale rejection of the party in power. With a Republican like Ford in the White House, it would be difficult for Reagan — or any other Republican — to make a blistering critique of business as usual. There is a reason why only one president in the last century has managed to turn the White House over to a candidate of their own party, and Ford would have faced that challenge with bleak economic conditions.</p><p>It’s also likely Ford would have sought to undermine Reagan’s 1980 bid. Ford always believed that Reagan’s 1976 primary challenge, and his lackluster support of the ticket in the fall, was one key reason for his defeat. Had Ford managed to beat Carter, he would almost surely have held Reagan in “minimum high regard” and done all in his power to damage him.</p><p>What about the Democrats?</p><p>With Carter effectively out of the picture, Sen. Ted Kennedy would have been the clear favorite, as he in fact was at the outset of his primary challenge to President Carter’s renomination in 1980. (“I don’t think he can be denied the nomination if he wants it,” House Speaker Tip O’Neill said at the start of Kennedy’s bid.) But the obstacles to Kennedy that emerged during his campaign would have been equally present had Carter not occupied the White House.</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/35/1f/15fce1904b19860720edcaa932c2/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary6.jpg" /><br /><p>In 1980, there was still a significant cohort of moderate and even conservative Democrats who resisted Ted Kennedy as the champion of his party’s left. Beyond that, of course, was Chappaquiddick, his 1969 drive off a bridge in Cape Cod that left Mary Jo Kopechne, a young campaign aide, to drown. Yes, it was more than a decade in the past, but as we saw in 1980, the press — so often derided as a Kennedy-friendly apparatus — had a powerful instinct to turn its attention to the front-runner. The series of highly critical accounts of his behavior — in a Readers’ Digest article heavily promoted with TV ads, in a “CBS Reports” documentary, in sketches on “Saturday Night Live,” would have been even more pointed in a campaign where Kennedy was so obviously the favorite. And there’s no guarantee that Kennedy’s answer in an interview with CBS’ Roger Mudd would have been any less wounding. (“Senator,” Mudd asked, “why do you want to be president?” The answer was a minutes-long word salad, interrupted by frequent stumbles and hesitations, that left even liberal journalists and columnists appalled).</p><p>Would Kennedy have survived the scrutiny? He did win 7.3 million primary votes against a sitting president — 37 percent of the total — along with key states like New York, California, and Pennsylvania. Could he have been upset by a fresh face on the national scene, like Arkansas’ Dale Bumpers or Colorado Sen. Gary Hart? (In one chapter of my alternative history book “Then Everything Changed,” I recounted that possibility). Would a Reagan candidacy have been fatally wounded by the unpopularity of a departing Republican president?</p><p>There are no certainties here. What can be said is that had Gerald Ford remembered not to liberate Poland prematurely at that debate in 1976, the Reagan revolution might never have happened.</p><br />]]></content:encoded>

Yet a small group of deeply unserious people has consumed an inordinate and growing amount of the speaker’s time over the last 12 years.</p><p>Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has given us fresh evidence of that this week as she threatened to pull the trigger on a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson only to deescalate — at least temporarily — after multiple meetings with him. But the standoff, for all its foolishness, gives the House a chance to reverse this drift and serve as a turning point toward becoming a more deliberative body once again.</p><p>Over the House’s more than two centuries, there has no doubt been all manner of cranks and questionable characters serving in the institution. It is a modern phenomenon, however, that we pay them so much attention. Today, congressional politics revolve around a rump group of lawmakers who typically hold no significant role on committees, often have served just a few terms, and whose rhetoric implies only a tenuous grasp of political reality.</p><p>We must stop taking them so seriously. We need a bipartisan pact that we’re going to stop letting the people who delight in the absurd have an outsize influence in the House. It would be good for the institution, good for Republicans and even good for Democrats.</p><p>Both parties have their gadflies and their fringes, but the reality is that the forces fueling historic levels of congressional dysfunction are coming from a small but growing group of Republican hard-liners. And it’s infected the culture of the broader House GOP. I’ve seen that up close, having previously served as an adviser to Speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan.</p><p>Lately, Greene has accused Johnson, a conservative derided by the left as “MAGA Mike,” of literally being a Democrat. She’s among a swath of Republicans who insist a tiny House majority can foist a conservative agenda upon a Senate and White House controlled by Democrats.</p><p>Similar nonsense was thrown at Johnson’s predecessors whenever they would strike a necessary bipartisan agreement. Republicans have indulged this ridiculous thinking too long; indeed, doing so has only emboldened the hard-liners from one speakership to the next.</p><p>Boehner could barely tolerate many members of the Freedom Caucus, and he did little to hide it. Ryan believed a dash of inclusivity and an open line of communication would moderate their worst instincts, and he held a weekly lunch with members from different pockets of the conference, including Freedom Caucus leaders. Kevin McCarthy went so far as to give the chair of the Freedom Caucus a seat at the leadership table.</p><p>No matter the approach, the threats from the far right never subsided.</p><p>Johnson similarly spent much of his first six months in office chasing around their unrealistic demands until he, surprising many, decided to pass a domestic funding agreement and a large foreign aid package with broad bipartisan support.</p><p>Greene’s threat to try to boot Johnson using the motion to vacate is the latest turn in a cycle that makes the House a miserable place to serve.</p><p>That’s why this moment offers an opportunity for both parties to begin to fix the House.</p><p>Democrats have already pledged the votes needed to protect Johnson, but only once. If Greene does reverse herself and force a vote against the speaker, he should be prepared to go further than just defeating it. He should call another vote to change the House rules so that one member alone cannot trigger the motion to vacate. This will require Democratic help, but it can be presented as a commitment to govern honestly rather than continually at the mercy of Greene or others operating on bad faith. Similarly, if hard-liners keep defeating procedural votes on the floor as they have in record number this year, Johnson should normalize the practice of bipartisan rules — again working with Democrats to effectively govern the floor if he must.</p><p>What people like Greene crave more than anything is attention. And the motion to vacate is their most potent tool for commanding it. It is the weapon that has, even in quieter times, hovered over the thinking of four straight GOP speakers. When that weapon is taken away, there is a completely different equation for leadership, allowing for rational decision making about what is best for the Republican Conference and the House.</p><p>Of course, taking away the motion to vacate does not solve all the speaker’s troubles. As we have seen in spectacular fashion this Congress, hard-liners can still make it more difficult to bring bills up for a vote, and they will still be able to raise money and play to the conservative media in ways that undermine their colleagues.</p><p>That is why this is not a problem that leadership alone can address. The rank and file, too, must not tolerate criticism that defies the obvious realities of divided government. There is a cultural peculiarity in the House GOP where it is almost taboo to say out loud that a conservative priority is not immediately achievable. Even behind closed doors, few words are devoted to what can reasonably be attained. Everything must be grounded in a fight for the maximalist position. And whenever conservatives foil a more realistic plan, they do so with impunity.</p><p>Change starts with a shift in culture of the House GOP Conference. It must be okay to say true things, like that hard-liners are making policy outcomes less conservative, not more, by refusing to back their own speaker.</p><p>As we have seen, change also requires cooperation from Democrats. It is reasonable for the minority party to question why they should be in the business of protecting a Republican speaker from conservative hard-liners. We should not pretend that Democrats’ primary goal isn’t to take back the House. And it is fair to believe continued chaos in the GOP majority sends a signal that it is not a party capable of governing. At the same time, there is also little evidence that these leadership fights break through with voters, especially by the time they go to the polls.</p><p>What’s more, should Democrats take back the House, it’s entirely possible they too will have a tiny majority, given how few competitive districts we now have. Democrats are not immune from party infighting, and it would be good for the whole House if both parties commit to rewarding sanity, not hijinks.</p><p>The alternative today for Democrats is a speaker more beholden to the hard-liners and an institution incapable of doing even basic responsibilities. A short-term assist to Greene or like-minded conservative bomb-throwers would do more long-term damage to an institution that nearly all bemoan as dysfunctional.</p><p>Morale on Capitol Hill is as low as anyone can remember. And why wouldn’t it be? Most weeks, little gets done, and the House is constantly under threat by people who have no interest in governing. This has contributed to an unmistakable trend of members retiring while still in their legislative prime. The U.S. House of Representatives has become a place where serious people feel like they don’t fit in.</p><p>Whether that continues is a choice. Johnson, to his credit, has shown that governance is possible if the loudest, most disingenuous voices are ignored.</p><p>If the hard-liners don’t like it, there is an alternative: act like a majority and back your speaker. And then win more elections so there are the actual conditions for conservative governance, not the pretend ones they’ve been operating under.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Wednesday will be the last workday for the group’s roughly 25 employees, though staffers will continue to receive paychecks and health care benefits for the next few months.</p><p>The development brings to a close a period of turmoil for the organization. FreedomWorks laid off <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2023/03/08/freedomworks-lays-off-40-percent-of-staff-00086188" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;40 percent&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2023/03/08/freedomworks-lays-off-40-percent-of-staff-00086188&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0150000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0150001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">40 percent</a> of its staff in March of 2023, and as a result of a drop in fundraising, its total revenue has declined by roughly half, to about $8 million, since 2022, Brandon said.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with POLITICO Magazine, Brandon said the decision to shut down was driven by the ideological upheaval of the Trump era.</p><p>After Trump took control of the conservative movement, Brandon said, a “huge gap” opened up between the libertarian principles of FreedomWorks leadership and the MAGA-style populism of its members. FreedomWorks leaders, for example, still believed in free trade, small government and a robust merit-based immigration system. Increasingly, however, those positions clashed with a Trump-aligned membership who called for tariffs on imported goods and a wall to keep immigrants out but were willing, in Brandon’s view, to remain silent as Trump’s administration added $8 trillion to the national debt.</p><p>“A lot of our base aged, and so the new activists that have come in [with] Trump, they tend to be much more populist,” Brandon said. “So you look at the base and that just kind of shifted.”</p><p>This same split was creating headaches in other parts of the organization as well. “Our staff became divided into MAGA and Never Trump factions,” Brandon said in an internal document reviewed by POLITICO Magazine. It also impacted fundraising.</p><p>“Now I think donors are saying, ‘What are you doing for Trump today?’” said Paul Beckner, a member of FreedomWorks’ board. “And we’re not for or against Trump. We’re for Trump if he’s doing what we agree with, and we’re against him if he’s not. And so I think we’ve seen an erosion of conservative donors.”</p><p>Brandon, for his part, said some donors would contact him to complain that the organization was doing too much to help Trump, while others called to complain that they weren’t doing enough to help Trump. “It is an impossible position,” he said.</p><p>In trying to balance these competing pressures, Brandon said he resolved to “keep a working relationship [with the pro-Trump populists] on the issues we agreed upon.” This too created conflicts.</p><p>In an interview with POLITICO Magazine last September, an ex-FreedomWorks employee <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715180108675,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d8-d8b7-a9bb-f7ff620d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715180108675,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d8-d8b7-a9bb-f7ff620d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58b3-d37b-a3ff-78bb73e60001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;claimed that the organization&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58b3-d37b-a3ff-78bb73e60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">claimed that the organization</a> under Brandon’s leadership had turned its back on its values while Trump was in office; during this period, for example, the organization issued tweets spreading election conspiracies and deflecting criticism of the Florida legislation that came to be known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. “He let a bunch of right-wing nutjobs turn FreedomWorks into a MAGA mouthpiece,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the former FreedomWorks staffer said&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0150002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0150003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the former FreedomWorks staffer said</a>.</p><p>Brandon said he “did my best to balance the two competing ideologies.”</p><p>In the midst of this turmoil, FreedomWorks <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715180164128,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d8-d8b7-a9bb-f7ff620d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715180164128,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d8-d8b7-a9bb-f7ff620d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58b4-dcc8-addf-d8bf49eb0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;launched an effort&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58b4-dcc8-addf-d8bf49eb0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">launched an effort</a> last fall to rebrand itself as a more centrist organization, one that could target the independent voters that its leaders believe would be more receptive to libertarian ideals.

FreedomWorks split apart from the Koch political network in 2004.</p><p>Brandon said he has plans to launch a new organization focused on politically independent members of the millennial and Gen Z generations, whom he thinks will be receptive to libertarian policies. “If we started something new, you could build it from the ground up,” Brandon said. “You could build a brand that matches what these folks want, and you could get away around all the baggage [associated with the FreedomWorks brand].”</p>]]></content:encoded>

It’s the latest example of how the conflict is straining center-left politics across the globe — and challenging the place of Jewish leaders in mainstream progressive politics.</p><p>“I was so distressed with my government’s position on this issue, I really contemplated whether or not I still belonged,” he said in an interview with POLITICO Magazine.</p><p>The progressive New Democratic Party had introduced a motion that called for the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state and a suspension of arms trading with Israel. Dozens of Liberals were said to be supportive. Up against a divided caucus, Trudeau’s government negotiated softer language, including support for a two-state solution and a halt to “further authorization and transfer of arms” to Israel.</p><p>During a dramatic vote in March, the amended motion was <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/members/en/votes/44/1/658" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;approved over the opposition&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ourcommons.ca/members/en/votes/44/1/658&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0180000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0180001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">approved over the opposition</a> of Conservatives and just three Liberals. That included Housefather, who left the House in a huff following his caucus’ standing ovation for the NDP.</p><p>For weeks, the three-term MP agonized over his future in the party. He spoke at length to family and friends, constituents, Jewish Canadians outside of his riding, and to Conservatives who entertained the idea of Housefather crossing the floor to join them on the opposition benches.</p><p>Housefather’s exit from the Liberals would have rocked Parliament and exacerbated tension within Trudeau’s caucus on the war in the Middle East.</p><p>Ultimately, he decided against bolting his party. And he recently opened up about his monthslong political rollercoaster, rising antisemitism in Canada and around the world, and how he responds to Jewish constituents when they confide their fears.</p><p><i>The following has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p><p><b>During the past couple of months, you were at odds frequently with your own caucus on Israel’s war against Hamas.</b></p><p>Since December of last year, pro-Israeli Canadians — including the vast majority of Jewish Canadians — were not happy with actions the government took, whether on the U.N. vote [to <a href="https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/un-onu/statements-declarations/2023-12-12-explanation-vote-explication.aspx?lang=eng" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;demand a cease-fire&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/un-onu/statements-declarations/2023-12-12-explanation-vote-explication.aspx?lang=eng&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0180002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0180003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">demand a cease-fire</a>], whether on the inability to articulate in the International Court of Justice that Israel wasn't committing genocide, whether on the funding of UNRWA and whether on this motion that came before the House where instead of voting against the NDP motion, the government decided to amend it.</p><p>I've been able to speak my mind and speak out publicly when I disagreed with what my party did. It allowed many people in the country, Jewish Canadians of all political persuasions and many Liberals who are pro-Israel across the country, to know their voices were not alone — that within the Liberal Party, there are voices that remain strongly pro-Israel, and that are incredibly concerned about the antisemitism in demonstrations and on campuses in this country.</p><p><b>Do you think your vote on that NDP motion forced some Liberals to rethink their views on the Israel-Hamas conflict?</b></p><p>I can't speak for everyone. What I can say is that a large number of my colleagues reached out over the weeks following that motion to tell me how much they wanted me to stay in caucus and to also try to better understand why it was that I was so disillusioned.</p><p>I had made my views very clear to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and her team, and to the Prime Minister's Office. But my caucus colleagues hadn't had the opportunity to hear from me. Since then, they <i>have</i> had the opportunity to hear from me on why antisemitism needs to be a high priority for the government domestically.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/99/92/2662c4a34ee8856c90addcdafd3b/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1235395136" /><br /><p>When Iran attacked Israel [in April], MPs suddenly realized they had voted for a motion that stopped us from allowing Canadian manufacturers to ship defensive military technology to Israel. So our democratic Western ally is being attacked by the biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. And yet, if it were up to this resolution in Canada, nobody should be shipping Israel anything to defend themselves. That woke people up.</p><p><b>The prime minister asked you to work on “concrete actions” with Deborah Lyons, Canada's special envoy for combating antisemitism. What can you say about that work?</b></p><p>I'm working on an action plan with Deborah.</p><p>We should not need to get injunctions in order to stop protests directly outside of churches, synagogues, schools, community centers. There has to be a protective bubble around those buildings.</p><p>In Montreal, now there's an injunction that's been continued yet again, after an incident where people blocked the Jewish community offices where the Jewish public library and the Holocaust Museum are. Nobody could enter or leave the building for three to four hours. You can't use your free speech rights to deny others their free speech rights.</p><p><b>What do your constituents expect of you?</b></p><p>Of course, they come to their MP. I'm not a pastor, or a rabbi or a counselor with any experience in psychological training, but they expect me and my government, and also the provincial or municipal governments that are largely left out of this, to solve the problem.</p><p><b>What are you hearing?&#xa0;</b></p><p>We're all talking about what's going on with antisemitism: What's going on on college campuses? What's going on in demonstrations? Should we move to the United States? Should we move to Israel?</p><p>The idea that there are Jewish Canadians that don't even know if their future is in this country — it is something that is horrific after this community has been here for the last 264 years.</p><p>I don't think anybody my age, or even alive today, ever expected to see things like this after the 1930s. Psychologically, it's devastating, to pretty much all Jewish Canadians, whatever their political perspective, whatever their history.</p><p>It's just a shock. It's not only Canada. This is happening in Western democracies across the world. It's happening in the United States. It's happening in Australia. It's happening in England. It's happening in France.</p><p><b>What do you tell constituents who are worried?</b></p><p>I empathize. I tell them I understand your fears, I understand your concerns. I talk about the fact that I brought a motion to the House of Commons justice committee, where we're going to be doing a study on antisemitism focused on college campuses. I talk about the fact that I've written to university presidents across the country and gotten answers from the 29 biggest Canadian universities. I'm also following up with universities regularly, and following up with students on campuses across the country.</p><p>I try to give them the glimmer of hope. The vast majority of Canadians are on our side, the vast majority of Canadians are not the people in the streets yelling hateful things. And the vast majority of Canadians just don't know what to do. But they also look on with horror about antisemitism in Canada.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/23/bb/c34038ca4d919214a22d374b2335/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1247878922" /><br /><p>The worst thing is for people to feel that the government doesn't care. The government cares very much. We just need to find the right ways to address it.</p><p><b>There was a lot of anticipation around you potentially leaving the Liberals. How seriously did you consider that option?</b></p><p>When my colleagues joined in to give a standing ovation to the NDP member who sponsored the original anti-Israel motion, it was very disappointing. I was so distressed with my government's position on this issue, I really contemplated whether or not I still belonged. That was the struggle.</p><p>I'm much more of a centrist. My positions on not just Israel but on a number of issues are very centrist. I believe the Liberal Party has to be a place for the center-left and the center-right and the center — not just the left. I wanted to reconcile my views with the fact that on a number of issues, I haven't been in agreement. I ended up coming to the conclusion that if people like me left the Liberal Party, then the centrist values that I espouse would be absent from the party that's in power in Canada most of the time.</p><p>I had so many Canadians from across the country, that were non-Jewish liberals, who said, "Please, please stay. Because when you speak, you speak for me. I want to know that my views do have a place in the party." That made a difference.</p><p><b>Did you visualize yourself as a Conservative?</b></p><p>Political parties are not black and white. This party is not perfect, and this party is not horrible. Political parties are creatures of an amalgam of people and amalgam of values. I just don't believe that other parties are inherently evil, or are inherently good.</p><p>Is the right answer to leave and not be a voice for the values I stand for in the big broad Liberal Party? What does that accomplish? It makes it less likely the Liberal Party is going to ever espouse my values. Or do I stay and accept that sometimes I'm going to be on the losing end of the equation — but I still contribute and have meaningful input, and one day, maybe I'll be on the winning side of more decisions.<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

He’s bragged about grabbing women by the you-know-what. He’s in the middle of a court case over paying hush money to a porn star with whom he allegedly cheated on his wife — the third woman he’s married. And he’s the <i>de facto </i>leader of American evangelicalism.</p> <p>How could Christians embrace a leader who has seemingly treated half the “thou shalt nots” in the Bible as a challenge? The typical answer is that it’s a matter of political convenience. Donald Trump may not be a choir boy, the conventional wisdom suggests, but he offers Christians wins on socially conservative policies, and he appointed Supreme Court justices who delivered for evangelicals by overturning <i>Roe v. Wade</i>.</p><p>But anyone who’s so much as set foot in an evangelical church over the last eight years knows that Christians don’t describe Trump as an unfortunate necessity, but a literal God-send. Political convenience alone doesn’t explain that.</p><p>Sex might.</p><p>According to Samuel L. Perry, a sociologist of religion who has written several books on conservative Christianity including <i>Addicted to Lust: Pornography in the Lives of Conservative Protestants, </i>Trump’s sinful behavior may actually reinforce his support among at least some evangelicals.</p><p>Trump’s sexual misdeeds may break religious doctrine, Perry says, but they also affirm his masculinity — at least in the evangelical view. They demonstrate that Trump is a virile, red-blooded man, afflicted by God — like all “real men” — with lust. Not just lust for sex, Perry says, but for power. And much like Biblical warriors who themselves struggled with sexual temptation, Trump can wield that power to lead the faithful to glory.</p><p>In an interview for POLITICO Magazine, Perry spoke about how evangelical ideas about masculinity, pornography and sexuality help explain the most unusual but politically potent alliance in modern politics.</p><p><i>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p><p><b>How do you see evangelical theology and views of masculinity and sexuality impacting support for Trump?</b></p><p>In the Old Testament, you have these examples of flawed but wild and effective warriors for the Lord’s work, who also happen to be womanizers. Of course, you’ve got David, who is somebody who’s celebrated as the leader of Israel, who has his affair with Bathsheba. You’ve got Solomon, who has 1,000 concubines. But then you also have this character of Samson. I actually think Samson is the best metaphor for Trump.</p><p>Samson is just a full-time ass kicker. He’s this rampaging wild man who is like the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/03/31/john-wick-gun-violence-00089665" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715181367169,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-f8ec-dab7-a5ff-fced2e9d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715181367169,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-f8ec-dab7-a5ff-fced2e9d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/03/31/john-wick-gun-violence-00089665&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58c6-daad-a98f-7bcfa3330001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;John Wick&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58c6-daad-a98f-7bcfa3330000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">John Wick</a> of killing Philistines. That’s his favorite thing to do. His other favorite thing to do is to visit prostitutes, and his downfall ends up being this prostitute, Delilah. But that is often glossed over within the evangelical space — he’s still talked about as a hero, because God used him to fight the enemies of his people, and to do it fearlessly and even happily. So there was plenty of precedent in evangelical readings of the Old Testament to celebrate flawed but effective leaders who fail sexually. Maybe they aren’t representative of the best sexual morals, but God used them, and we still celebrate them as heroes.</p><p>Samson is another example, though, of something else. Samson is also thought of as this uber-masculine hero: He’s big, and he’s strong, and the representations of Samson are of this hyper-masculine guy. And part of that is his huge and enormous sexual appetites. The guy was the embodiment of physical superiority, and that includes his sexual superiority as well.</p><p><b>So Samson’s sexual appetites are sinful, but they’re also part of what makes him a strong man. Is sexual temptation seen as a fundamental part of the male evangelical experience?</b></p><p>In my research, I found that evangelicals tend to see sexual temptation as just a normal part of being a Christian man — that God gave men tremendous sexual appetites because he wanted them to be leaders and initiators and people who take charge. And this isn’t just about sexuality; this is about every area of life. This is what’s called <i>complementarianism</i>, that the ultimate male goal is to lead — in terms of politics, is to lead, in terms of moral authority, is to lead, and also in terms of sexual initiation. And that comes with a risk of those appetites being too strong, and somebody being overcome by their own sexual temptation — like a Samson.</p><p>So in Trump, you’ve got this guy who, yes, he has failed sexually. He has a history of being a womanizer. The Stormy Daniels thing is something that reflects poorly on him. And yet, it also reflects positively on his masculinity. Because this guy, he’s a man’s man. This guy is an initiator, he goes after what he wants. He’s going after women, and he now has a supermodel wife who looks like the embodiment of a kind of “trophy wife.” So Trump is representative of a kind of masculinity that is so masculine that his sexual appetites cannot be contained. That’s almost a good sign. In other words, he’s not Mike Pence — a kind of asexual, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/176764/said-it-mike-johnson-ned-flanders" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715181431494,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-f8ec-dab7-a5ff-fced2e9d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715181431494,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-f8ec-dab7-a5ff-fced2e9d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://newrepublic.com/article/176764/said-it-mike-johnson-ned-flanders&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58c7-daad-a98f-7bcf31090001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Ned Flanders kind of Christian&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58c7-daad-a98f-7bcf31090000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Ned Flanders kind of Christian</a> that is effete and ineffective. No, Trump is power personified. He is a warrior. And with that comes all of the temptations of being a warrior.</p><p><b>What are some ways you see these gendered dynamics playing out in evangelical spaces?</b></p><p>The classic example — and this is such a cliche that we in evangelical spaces often joke about it — but you have the insecure youth pastor who’s getting up in front of the church or getting up in front of his students and says, “Hey, at the back, check out my smokin’ hot wife, Tiffany,” or whatever. And it’s almost inviting you to imagine him having sex with this woman. And that is an example of what I’m talking about, that a Christian man, a leader, would be the one who gets to have sex with hot ladies. And that is a benefit of being the kind of man that God wants you to be.</p><p>One response that we’ve seen in evangelical spaces is the phenomenon of the “tradwife.” So <a href="https://time.com/6962381/tradwives-history/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the tradwife movement&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://time.com/6962381/tradwives-history/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd01e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd01e0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the tradwife movement</a>, you see social-media influencers embracing this idea of Godly femininity. And they’re going whole hog into this — baking bread and sewing clothes and really leaning into this identity of, “My man is the strong man, and he is the leader of our home. And even though I’m a social media influencer who is now making YouTube videos making money from that, let me just stress that I am a submissive wife and he is the strong, masculine husband who leads our home and our house spiritually.”</p><p>I think this is a response to a perceived loss of masculinity, of the idea that Christian men are no longer viewed as strong warrior-soldiers, that they are people who are passive and nice guys. That’s where you have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Driscoll" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;pastors like Mark Driscoll&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Driscoll&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd01e0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd01e0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">pastors like Mark Driscoll</a>, who was able to find that niche. He looked like a weightlifter. He always talked about how, in his former life as a non-Christian, he would beat people up. And he carried that persona: He was a tough guy, some kind of badass. He wore leather jackets and he cussed all the time. And with that, he was able to put on this persona of, Christians are tough; Christians are wild. Even before Trump, I think Driscoll was actually the example of what would eventually be the kind of masculinity Trump would sell — an untamable, virile leader who is flawed but gets the job done.</p><p><b>What role does pornography play in evangelical communities?</b></p><p>They call it a cancer — that’s a really common word they use for it. And some of them would say it’s the most dangerous threat to the church in history, primarily because of the way it fosters addiction among young people. This is in their words; there’s a lot of debate in the scientific community about the extent to which pornography is addictive. As somebody who’s spent a lot of time researching these things, I’m more inclined to feel that pornography is actually just fuel for a masturbation habit that is developed at young ages — it just carries on, and pornography just happens to be that visual stimulus that people seek out. It’s readily available and convenient. But among evangelicals, pornography use is thought of like heroin: It causes addiction, it ruins people’s lives, it ruins their marriages.</p><p>And yet, at the same time, it is something that is reflective of just being a natural man, being a red-blooded male that God made to initiate sexually. And so if you were to enter into a men’s accountability group or some kind of community group at an evangelical church, and you were to say, “You know what, guys, I don’t really understand where you’re coming from: I’ve never struggled with this temptation. I’ve never looked at porn. I’ve never masturbated. I’ve never been attracted to that at all. And, frankly, y’all are weird.” They would look at you as if you are the weird one. Like, “What is wrong with you? Are you asexual? Are you a closeted homosexual? Like, is this something that you are not attracted to women?” Because it’s such a common part of evangelical male life to struggle and fight against lust and sexual sin.</p><p>In that sense, Trump’s affair with Stormy Daniels makes him relatable. Because the battle with lust is something that every Christian man is supposed to deal with.</p><p>They’re supposed to be pursuing sex; God made them to do that so that they can make more babies — <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/compare/PSA.127.3-5" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;arrows in the warriors’ quiver&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.bible.com/bible/compare/PSA.127.3-5&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd01e0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd01e0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">arrows in the warriors’ quiver</a> for the kingdom.</p><p>The flip side of that — when women exercise any kind of sexual agency, they are in fact acting outside of the balance that God created for them. Women are designed to be sexual responders; they’re not supposed to be initiators. One of the things that I found in interviewing so many women for this book, <i>Addicted to Lust</i>, was that when evangelical women struggled with sexual sin — say, watching pornography or masturbating, those kinds of things — they experienced this as a kind of double shame. One of the shames was failing sexually and watching pornography or masturbating. But the other part of it was what is called “sinning against your gender,” which is the idea that, “I’m weird for wanting this, I’m weird for being turned on visually, weird for liking sex and initiating that.”</p><p>So Stormy Daniels and any other women who are involved in these kinds of affairs are usually not given the benefit of the doubt.</p><p><b>How do evangelical leaders and institutions treat women who are cast in this Delilah role?</b></p><p>If you follow the narratives with, say, the <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/investigations/abuse-of-faith/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Southern Baptist sex scandals&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/investigations/abuse-of-faith/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd01e0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd01e0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Southern Baptist sex scandals</a> that have come out within the last few years, often the counter-narrative that I see, at least on social media and among some Christian right journalists, is to ask, “Well, what was the woman’s role in this?” The Christian right is now so partisan, that any of the darlings of the left — like minorities who are harmed in situations of police brutality, or women who are the victims of sexual assault — the first impulse on the Christian right is to say, “Well, what did they do? Did they have it coming? Did they ask for it? Were they initiating this in some way? Are they lying just to get some godly person in trouble? Are they lying to get the cops in trouble, to get a pastor in trouble?” There is an evangelical suspicion, or a Christian right suspicion, of women involved in these kinds of sexual affairs — that they are probably asking for it, probably tempting, probably not helping the situation, certainly not victims.</p><p><b>Whereas the men in this equation just succumbed to temptation and should be defended or redeemed.</b></p><p>Absolutely. In my book, I talk about how the language of addiction is actually a way that evangelical men can let themselves off the hook. Because when you say that I’m addicted, it creates a rhetorical distance between you and the sexual sin itself. It’s not you making conscious decisions every day to look at pornography. What am I supposed to do? I’m addicted.</p><p>It goes even further than this. When you say things like, “I’m enslaved.” That’s a common one. When you say, “I’m enslaved to porn,” or, “I’m enslaved to sexual sin.” You don’t have any agency at that point. It’s involuntary. Like all sin slaves, I’ve been trapped, I’ve been ensnared. It’s like this thing that’s outside of you — the devil or pornography or some temptress or whatever — captured you and dragged you off. And now you’re just a slave to that sexual sin. And it’s a way that you can redeem that sin in a way that sounds more forgivable. This is a common rhetorical move to make a sexual sin that is completely volitional, and very much habitual, conscious and oftentimes very planned out — you can make it seem more, “Oh, it’s kind of accidental.” It’s not something that reflects the character of that person.</p><p><b>Do you think all this has changed evangelicals’ political priorities?</b></p><p>What really matters is the culture war. It’s not family values, unless it’s like anti-LGBTQ values. It’s not being a good neighbor.</p><p>Mike Johnson, the House leader, is kind of a dinosaur when it comes to his representation of what a conservative Christian looks like. Because Johnson, he talks in this traditional Southern Baptist style — a good looking, clean-cut guy who would have been a great pastor back in 1995. He’s an old-school throwback to that kind of language and rhetoric about Christian character and leadership.</p><p>But that’s not what conservative Christianity looks like anymore. Now, conservative Christianity looks like Trump and his supporters. I think that is changing the character of American evangelicalism. Mike Johnson is a thing of the past and really doesn’t exercise any kind of political leadership in evangelical space. What exercises leadership in evangelical space now is the cultural warrior.</p><p><b>Does that emphasis on tough-guy politics and the sense among conservative Christians that they are under threat mean that the standard for religious leaders is lower — we don’t need you to be perfect, just on our side?</b></p><p>It used to be, when I was in college, you had people like <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/22/coronavirus-trump-robert-jeffress-evangelical-supporter-140355" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Robert Jeffress&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/22/coronavirus-trump-robert-jeffress-evangelical-supporter-140355&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd01e0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd01e0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Robert Jeffress</a>, who would have called Catholics and Mormons a cult, and that our number-one task was to try to convert and oppose this kind of influence. And now you’d have those same kinds of religious leaders saying that these are our allies, they’re on the team with us, we’re fighting for family values and freedom and faith and religious liberty. That makes you Christian enough. Trump is an example of that. Could you really nail somebody down and say, hey, Trump never goes to church. Look at the way he talks, look at the way he reacts to people. Has he ever confessed sins? Anything? They would probably say no. But he fights for our values. And honestly, that makes him Christian enough.<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

But it wasn’t news to people who worked on her first book, where the tale made it into a draft of the memoir before the publishing team nixed it.</p><p>Then, as now, Noem wanted the story in because it showed a decisive person who was unwilling to be bound by namby-pamby niceties, while others on the team — which included agents, editors and publicists at Hachette Book Group’s prestige Twelve imprint, and a ghostwriter — saw it as a bad-taste anecdote that would hurt her brand. The tale was ultimately cut, according to two people involved with the project.</p><p>In other words, they produced a typical pre-campaign book, where the first rule is to do no harm.

But it is an interesting window into the Washington industry of pre-campaign memoirs — where the goal of defining a brand is often at odds with the goal of producing interesting copy, and where nobody puts a great deal of emphasis on quality control or literary drama.</p><p>Even within the grandiose political-memoir category, the rising-national-candidate subgenre historically stood out in its formulaic dullness. A big shot at the end of a career can at least describe being in the room when important things happened, or use a book to settle scores with folks readers might actually have heard of. A governor trying to establish a national footprint doesn’t have that kind of material to work with.</p><p>Which means that the tomes have typically been paint-by-numbers affairs in which a ghostwriter tries to spin some log-cabin yarns from the pol’s childhood, dramatize otherwise obscure old clashes over local political issues, and maybe toss in a nod to the noble responsibility that came with commanding their state’s National Guard.</p><p>“It was their calling card,” said Larry Weissman, a New York-based literary agent who sells lots of political books and was involved with then-Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper’s (actually well-reviewed) 2016 memoir. “It gave them an excuse to do more media and tour around the country. But they always play it incredibly safe and so they’re boring AF. And so nobody really reads them.”</p><p>But just because they’re not usually meant to be read doesn’t mean they’re not meant to be purchased. Especially now, in an age when the line between cable-TV political provocateur and actual elected official has blurred, a book by a telegenic rising political star might sell for the same reason as a book by a talking-head figure like Mark Levin: People buy it as a sort of tribal emblem for their politics.</p><p>Noem’s first book is a case in point: It sold 100,000 copies across all formats and made the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list, an easy win for its publisher. “The industry doesn’t think much of these books but they may make easy money for a publisher,” is how one top agent put it to me, speaking anonymously, perhaps because the agency would like to keep working in this line of business.</p><p>Thanks to the economics of book publishing — where a single smash hit balances out a string of mediocre sellers — publishers also know that there’s always a chance that the vicissitudes of politics could lead to gold even with mediocre sellers: Consider the memoir by the unknown Harvard Law School graduate Barack Obama, which became a bestseller years later when the future president’s star rose.</p><p>But for every book like that, there are volumes by supposedly can’t-miss candidates like Marco Rubio that disappear along with the politician’s fortunes.</p><p>Now the second Noem book is unintentionally highlighting that often-overlooked other factor in campaign books: Quality control.</p><p>Ordinarily, few of the players have much motivation to care about excellence. For the publisher, it’s the politician’s name that’s going to make a book sell or flop. For an ambitious pol trying to build a brand, repeating political nostrums often seems a better way to do so than pushing the literary envelope.</p><p>It doesn’t help that the pols’ production process can be hasty — and facilitated by loyalists. “They will often be crashed, so they come in late, and then they’re edited quickly,” said Weissman.</p><p>“There is this tendency among politicians to hire staffers or somebody who maybe doesn’t have the wherewithal or stature to be able to push back and say, hey, the story you want to tell isn’t imparting the point that you want to make,” said Keith Urbahn of the Beltway literary agency Javelin, which has sold scores of political memoirs from pols ranging from Adam Schiff to Ted Cruz. (Javelin also represented Noem on her first book, though they declined comment on the behind-the-scenes processes for any specific authors.)</p><p>The campaign-book genre is so widely mocked that even its most convincing defense involves a calculus more interesting to journalists than to regular people who just want to curl up with a good book: The longtime book critic Carlos Lozada, whose recent collection, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Washington-Book-Read-Politics-Politicians/dp/1668050730/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Py230-XRa3B2Nt5O8UNQtPNpFaEKknUaWpPNrexVGuRQP2QWRHPgH2y32N7s4OOFWGp0-So9cGyxfkQp8xcOsw.t5Z0syg3e5PdKXReHkhTIepcYX8TIJVVypfC4gPUdBI&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_-GxBhC1ARIsADGgDjsmBW0BDt4ZfPEeW50yzcfjHbuTkJREo-9EtDKHrR_46iA58yKqgPMaAgzpEALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=692760139675&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1027027&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=3188828545569043181&amp;hvtargid=kwd-2472808083112&amp;hydadcr=15334_13517973&amp;keywords=carlos+lozada+the+washington+book&amp;qid=1715005058&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;i>The Washington Book&lt;/i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Washington-Book-Read-Politics-Politicians/dp/1668050730/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Py230-XRa3B2Nt5O8UNQtPNpFaEKknUaWpPNrexVGuRQP2QWRHPgH2y32N7s4OOFWGp0-So9cGyxfkQp8xcOsw.t5Z0syg3e5PdKXReHkhTIepcYX8TIJVVypfC4gPUdBI&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_-GxBhC1ARIsADGgDjsmBW0BDt4ZfPEeW50yzcfjHbuTkJREo-9EtDKHrR_46iA58yKqgPMaAgzpEALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=692760139675&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1027027&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=3188828545569043181&amp;hvtargid=kwd-2472808083112&amp;hydadcr=15334_13517973&amp;keywords=carlos+lozada+the+washington+book&amp;qid=1715005058&amp;sr=8-1&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd023000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd023000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>The Washington Book</i></a><i>,</i> is all about Beltway lit, has argued that campaign books are a place pols tell on themselves by the way they shade things or position stories. But that requires a kind of delving between the lines that for most civilians is different from actually reading for pleasure.</p><p>Noem’s new book — which doesn’t officially publish until May 7 — meets that standard: Whatever you think of putting down a dog for attacking a neighbor’s chickens, the decision to keep the story in the book also seems to show a political culture so devoted to shocking establishment nostrums that it fails to recognize how loving dogs is a pretty mainstream piece of American culture.

Newspapers and magazines stand behind the things they put out, but in book-publishing, the veracity of a work is entirely on the writer.</p><p>Javelin’s principals told me they thought the embarrassing round of publicity around Noem’s new book might be a reminder that quality actually matters, whether the goal is selling books or selling a candidacy. “You can’t fake being a bestseller for weeks,” Urbahn said.</p><p>“Somebody who has a big platform can get on TV the week their book comes out and sell a certain number of copies,” said Matt Latimer, who runs the agency with Urbahn. “But if your book isn’t any good content, or there are all kinds of errors in it, you don’t have that tail — and what you really want, and what a publisher wants, is a book by someone prominent that lasts more than a week. And that’s why content, fact-checking, research, saying something new and interesting, or having an argument matters.”</p><p>Sounds good to me, but there’s also an irony about the story that has Noem in so much hot water: If I were editing a memoir by some public figure in or out of politics, and it included a story about intentionally killing their dog, I would <i>absolutely</i> include it — it’s a fascinatingly unusual tale, so different from the typical self-aggrandizing autobiographer, one that raises huge questions and reveals something about character. I bet audiences would agree.</p><p>Of course, thinking of the audience in terms of readers rather than voters is why I’m a writer, not a PR ace.</p><p>“We try to be a full service agency that is looking around corners, anticipating problems, ultimately creating the most commercial version of a book that is in keeping with the author’s intended goals,” Urbahn said.</p><p>We’ll find out soon enough whether the Cricket story made the book more interesting to readers: It comes out Tuesday, but spent the last week on Amazon’s top 1,000 even before publication day. As for what the choice means for her political future, we may need to wait just a little longer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Less than 17 percent of the money Congress approved has been spent so far.</h2><p><b>What we found:</b> Out of more than $1.6 trillion these laws provided for climate, infrastructure and energy, roughly $1.1 trillion was to be direct spending — largely in the form of grants, loans and contracts.</p><p>But it’s taken a while to get the dollars moving.</p><p>For the infrastructure, pandemic and CHIPS laws, agencies have formally awarded $242 billion to date, meaning the federal government has committed to pay out this sum. For the IRA, the government has announced roughly $60 billion in potential funding.</p><p>The amount that agencies have actually spent is even smaller, between $125 billion and $186 billion, according to POLITICO’s review of federal data. That number is a broad range because no public resource offers a full accounting of formal awards or spending under the IRA. As a result, we’ve included the full scope of funding announced under the IRA in our estimate in order to reflect the maximum amount of spending that could have taken place.</p><p><b>Why this matters: </b>The administration isn’t legally required to spend this money in Biden’s first term — and some of the infrastructure cash can’t legally be spent until next year or later. Biden White House officials predict a continued surge of formal commitments through at least January.</p><p>But the fact that only a relatively small percentage of the overall investment has been spent means the real-world effects may not yet have touched some parts of the country, including key voters in the election.<br /></p><br /><h2 style="text-align: left">2. Look beyond Biden's big announcements</h2><p><b>What we found:</b> The administration prefers to focus on a very big number — the amount of money agencies have announced they will provide to recipients under one or more of the laws.</p><p>These multibillion-dollar announcements have become a routine staple of the Biden era, often featuring a public appearance by the president or a member of his Cabinet. As of April, the announcements have totaled more than $543 billion, or half of the full value of what Congress appropriated.</p><p>Private companies, including those hoping for a share of the new grants, loans or tax breaks, have followed through with their own announcements. Those have totaled more than $866 billion in planned investments for industries such as advanced chips, electric vehicles and clean energy manufacturing.</p><p>But an announcement doesn’t necessarily mean the money will flow quickly — or that the announced recipient will ever see it. Agencies typically announce tentative awards after identifying a recipient and a funding amount, but the awards could still be under negotiation, and either side might back out.</p><p>Similarly, changing market conditions or worries about federal policy have prompted some companies to cancel or delay major electric vehicle, battery, solar and wind projects.</p><p><b>Why this matters:</b> Funding announcements can show that agencies are pushing to make progress on Biden’s agenda. Many published analyses of the administration’s policies have focused at least partly on the announcements. But the big-dollar proclamations may give an inflated picture of the impact that Biden’s policies are having so far.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">3. Spending over $1 trillion is a lot of work</h2><p><b>What we found: </b>There are several explanations for the gap between announced and actual spending.</p><p>For one, negotiations for this money can take time, with the federal government sometimes awarding money weeks or months after it makes the announcement. State governments and other recipients also have significant leeway to decide where the money goes — or even how quickly Washington can put it out. For instance, states that want federal funding for electric vehicle chargers must first compile plans for using the money. For large-scale infrastructure projects, recipients typically have to do the work before Washington reimburses them. That lengthy process can take years.</p><p>And not all announcements necessarily lead to the intended recipient getting the cash. For instance, the Energy Department announced it had selected a Texas-based company for a $200 million grant to support a battery project in Tennessee, only to withdraw the award last spring. DOE didn’t offer a specific explanation, but the company had drawn criticism from Republican lawmakers because of ties to China.</p><p>Another company told POLITICO that a behind-schedule environmental review is holding up the money that the federal government awarded it.</p><p><b>Why this matters: </b>The administration stresses — and our data shows — that it has made progress moving the money forward. But federal money comes with a lot of strings that frustrate some would-be recipients.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">4. Would these efforts survive Trump?</h2><p><b>What we found: </b>Trump has lambasted Biden’s green energy programs and <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-using-impoundment-to-cut-waste-stop-inflation-and-crush-the-deep-state" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;called for “impounding”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-using-impoundment-to-cut-waste-stop-inflation-and-crush-the-deep-state&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0300000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0300001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">called for “impounding”</a> congressionally approved spending he considers wasteful. He has been especially critical of the climate law and attacked Republican lawmakers who voted for the infrastructure law.</p><p>That increases the urgency for the Biden administration to implement the money effectively and quickly.</p><p><b>Why this matters: </b>A Trump victory would create massive uncertainty for whatever federal dollars remain un-obligated. He could halt or slow the remaining grant approvals and applications, and a Trump Treasury Department could revise stalled rules for clean energy tax credits to restrict access. And he could shift the speed and focus for the Energy Department’s approximately $200 billion in remaining energy loan authority — a program he proposed abolishing when he was president.</p><p>Read <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2024/biden-trillion-dollar-spending-tracker" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715091457112,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000187-1473-d989-a7a7-bfffa9da0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715091457112,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000187-1473-d989-a7a7-bfffa9da0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/interactives/2024/biden-trillion-dollar-spending-tracker&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5032-daad-a98f-7b3f4a150001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the full story here&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5032-daad-a98f-7b3f4a150000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the full story here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The poll found greater awareness of the Inflation Reduction Act, but still only 17 percent said they’ve heard “a lot” about it, and 35 percent said they’d heard “some” about it.</p><p>Of the four, the CHIPS and Science Act has the lowest profile. Only 9 percent of respondents said they’d heard “a lot” about it, while another 23 percent said they’d heard “some.”</p><p>Voters with higher incomes and higher levels of educational attainment tended to be slightly more likely to say they had heard about the laws.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">2. There’s a clear partisan divide over the laws</h2><br /><p>The greatest divide in the survey data falls along party lines. Self-identified Democrats are more likely to say they have seen, read or heard about the laws than Republicans or independents — and are far more likely to see them as personally beneficial or helping their communities.</p><p>For example, 37 percent of Democratic voters said the Inflation Reduction Act has impacted them positively, compared with only 12 percent of Republicans and 15 percent of independents. And 44 percent of Democrats said the bipartisan infrastructure law has positively impacted their community — far more than the 15 percent of Republicans and 23 percent of independents who agreed.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">3. Voters say they don’t see the benefits</h2><br /><p>The poll also suggests another problem for Biden: Broadly speaking, few voters say they’re seeing the federal government’s efforts to revitalize the nation’s infrastructure or build up a clean energy sector.</p><p>Only a quarter of voters, 25 percent, said “the clean energy and infrastructure projects approved since 2021” had increased jobs in their community. Thirty percent said they’ve had no impact, and another 28 percent didn’t know or had no opinion.</p><p>For the four specific laws tested — even when restricted to poll respondents who said they’d heard something about them — only around 25 percent said they had positively impacted them personally.</p><p>Asked about the combined impact of federal spending on infrastructure in their community since Biden became president, 26 percent said it had a “major impact,” another 26 percent said it had a “minor impact” and 30 percent said it had “no impact.” Eighteen percent of respondents had no opinion.</p><p>Biden can keep trying to champion infrastructure during the course of the campaign, but voters aren’t praising it right now.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">4. Many voters credit Trump, not Biden, for doing more on infrastructure</h2><br /><p>Many voters aren’t giving Biden credit when they do see positive benefits.</p><p>When he signed the infrastructure bill into law in 2021, Biden famously succeeded where Trump had failed. But asked who has done more to promote infrastructure improvements and job creation, nearly as many voters said Trump (37 percent) as Biden (40 percent). Twelve percent said they’ve both done about the same, and another 12 percent had no opinion.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, party identification is the key driver on this question. About three-in-four Democrats, 74 percent, said Biden has done more to promote infrastructure improvements and jobs — but an almost identical number of Republicans, 70 percent, said it’s Trump who’s done more. Among independents, roughly the same number picked Biden (34 percent) and Trump (32 percent).</p><p>Biden also has a slight edge among voters in the presidential battleground states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — leading Trump on the question of who gets more credit, 42 percent to 36 percent.</p><p>The Biden campaign’s most-aired TV ad seeks to make this point specifically: “For four years, Donald Trump tried to pass an infrastructure law — and he failed,” Biden says in the spot, which has been backed by $4.6 million in spending, according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political advertising. “I got it done. Now we’re rebuilding America.”</p><p>But on virtually every question about the spending bills — including whether Biden or Trump gets more credit — the poll numbers among respondents in electoral swing states did not meaningfully differ from the overall results. Some voters give him credit for the benefits they see — but nearly as many voters credit Trump instead.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Wade</i> nearly two years ago created a patchwork — and ever changing — landscape of abortion access in the United States, with roughly a third of states prohibiting the procedure in nearly all circumstances. That includes almost all of the southeastern United States, after a recent Florida Supreme Court ruling triggered a six-week abortion ban in the state that will take effect May 1 and cut off a key regional access point for the procedure.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a 160-year old aw outlawing abortions at any stage of pregnancy unless the patient’s life is in danger, with no exceptions for rape or incest. That decision could take effect as early as the end of May, though it is unclear how, whether and when the law will be enforced.</p><p>And ongoing litigation in other states, such as Nebraska, Iowa and Utah, could mean more changes to state abortion laws this year.</p><p>Abortion-rights groups are also pushing this year to pass constitutional amendments that would protect abortion access in states like Montana and Nevada and overturn abortion bans in Florida and Missouri.</p><p>Explore the map and table below for more on each state’s abortion laws:<br /></p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

He shook his head at times. His anger was so visible and distracting that the judge asked his lawyers to tell him to cool off.</p><p>But for all the eye-popping stories about their alleged tryst — which Trump has denied — the former president and his allies believe it will do little to dent him in the court of public opinion. Privately, they acknowledge that while Daniels’ details have been embarrassing, Trump’s messy personal affairs and love life have been tabloid fodder for decades.</p><p>“I think most Republicans — even ones who dislike him — recognize this as a complete and total B.S. trial in a kangaroo court that should’ve never been brought,” said Republican strategist Scott Jennings.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352606317112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Trump is under a gag order that prevents him from publicly commenting on jurors, witnesses or other people involved in the case, so he has leaned on surrogates and allies to spread his message. <a href="https://x.com/EricTrump/status/1787870712876671379" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;On X, Trump’s son, Eric&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/EricTrump/status/1787870712876671379&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd04b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd04b0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">On X, Trump’s son, Eric</a>, who previously showed up in the New York courtroom, questioned the relevance of Daniels’ salacious details.

To hear lies and disloyalty from whoever it is, that is a tough scenario for him,” said a Republican strategist close to the Trump campaign who was granted anonymity to speak freely.</p><p>And then there is the question of how the trial will impact Trump with voters. While a recent PBS <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/poll-majority-of-americans-arent-paying-attention-to-trumps-hush-money-trial" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/poll-majority-of-americans-arent-paying-attention-to-trumps-hush-money-trial&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd04b000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd04b000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll</a> found that 55 percent of Americans said they were not following the trial much or at all, Daniels’ testimony could hurt him with female voters, according to Jennifer Horn, the former chair of the New Hampshire GOP and a co-founded of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group.</p><p>“Her testimony makes [clear] what we already know about Trump — essentially that he's a sleazy, narcissistic, cheater,” said Horn, who said Daniels’ testimony was specific and detailed, lending her credibility. “Did she sound angry? Was she eager to see him held accountable? Yes, of course ... she speaks of experiences and fears that most women can relate to.”</p><p>As Daniels was on the stand, Trump had to sit silently and listen as she revealed a series of embarrassing details about her alleged sexual encounter with him. The case centers on accusations that the former president falsified business records to hide a $130,000 payment to Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. It’s one of four separate criminal cases Trump is facing. </p><p>The warning from the judge on Tuesday — that his audible cursing and head shaking was “contemptuous” — appeared to work. On Thursday, as Trump watched the cross examination, he was less visibly animated as his defense team was determined to put Daniels on her heels and try to paint her as inconsistent and greedy for fame and money.</p><p>“Your story has completely changed, hasn’t it?” Susan Necheles, an attorney for Trump, asked Daniels.</p><p>“No, not at all. You’re trying to make me say it’s changed but it hasn’t changed,” Daniels said.</p><p>Trump’s team pointed to moments where Daniels claimed Trump was wearing different clothing, whether or not they had dinner, or whether or not she “blacked out” during the encounter.</p><p>But Daniels also pushed back as Trump’s defense team cross examined Daniels for the second time in the New York trial.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352468420112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Necheles noted Daniels has an online store where she sells merchandise, like a $40 “Saint of Indictments” candle, which shows her draped like Christ and with a halo, and described it as “shilling.”</p><p>“Not unlike Mr. Trump,” Daniels said in reply. The former president recently hawked Bibles online and has sold steaks, hats and silk ties on his own website. She added that there were times she did not receive compensation for the publicity around her allegations, including a “60 Minutes” interview.</p><p>At the end of the day, Trump attorney Todd Blanche asked Justice Juan Merchan to declare a mistrial again in light of Daniels’ testimony. They also asked if Trump could publicly respond to Daniels’ testimony despite the gag order. The former president is scheduled to hold a rally in New Jersey on Saturday. </p><p>“He needs an opportunity to respond to the American people and the reasons for the gag order as it relates to Ms. Daniels is over. She’s no longer a witness,” Blanche said.</p><p>Prosecutors argued that allowing Trump to go after Daniels would have a chilling effect on future witnesses.</p><p>But Merchan bluntly <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/09/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/judge-dresses-down-trumps-lawyers-00157187" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;criticized Trump’s attorneys' overall strategy and their failure to object&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/09/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/judge-dresses-down-trumps-lawyers-00157187&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd04b000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd04b000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">criticized Trump’s attorneys' overall strategy and their failure to object</a> at key moments during Daniels’ testimony.</p><p>“For the life of me, I don’t know why Ms. Necheles didn’t object,” Merchan said. He also questioned why Trump’s team kept going back over questions about consent.</p><p>“I don’t know why you went into it ad nauseam on cross-examination,” the judge said. “You drummed it over and over again into the jury’s ears. I don’t understand the reason for that.”</p><p>He ruled against the Trump team’s motion for a mistrial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

There is no set trial date, and proceedings were derailed in recent months over allegations that the lead prosecutor, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, had committed ethical lapses stemming from a romantic relationship with a special prosecutor she hired.</p><p>After the trial judge, Scott McAfee, rejected a bid to kick Willis off the case, Trump and his co-defendants sought permission to appeal that ruling.

Wade <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/15/judge-rejects-trumps-bid-to-disqualify-georgia-prosecutor-00147286" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;resigned from the case in March&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/15/judge-rejects-trumps-bid-to-disqualify-georgia-prosecutor-00147286&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0520000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6d6c-d498-a1af-7f7dd0520001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">resigned from the case in March</a> after McAfee ruled that the relationship created the “appearance of conflict” but that Willis could remain on the case if Wade stepped down.</p><p>Trump is currently on trial in Manhattan on charges that he orchestrated a scheme to cover up an affair with a porn star to influence the 2016 election. But the Georgia decision ensures that Trump’s other three criminal cases remain in limbo and are increasingly unlikely to reach a verdict before voters cast ballots this fall.</p><p>In addition to the Florida case, Trump’s other federal criminal case — on charges that he criminally conspired to subvert the 2020 election — is also teetering as the Supreme Court considers whether to declare him immune from the charges altogether. A trial this year is still possible if the justices do not grant Trump the sweeping presidential immunity he says should block the prosecution.</p><p>But the legal snags have raised the odds that Trump might never face a jury in either of the two federal cases, both of which were brought by special counsel Jack Smith. If Trump wins the election later this year and the two federal cases remain pending, he is all but certain to order the Justice Department to unravel them. And his lawyers have foreshadowed efforts to postpone the Georgia trial during a potential presidency, even if it is allowed to proceed by the state courts.</p><p>McAfee has said that for practical reasons at least two trials would be required in the case to deal with the sprawling roster of 15 defendants. Trump and 18 others were charged in the indictment Willis obtained last August, but four of the defendants pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.</p><p>Prosecutors have asked that Trump be tried alongside all other defendants, but McAfee hasn’t ruled on that request.</p>]]></content:encoded>
