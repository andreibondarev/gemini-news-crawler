Three and a half years later, dozens of them are facing criminal charges that could land them in prison for years.</p><p>Dozens of others have not been charged at all.</p><p>Even though the fake electors all participated in the same scheme, some have been charged as dangerous criminals while others have been treated as mere dupes. These disparities depend almost entirely on where they live.</p><p>In Arizona, Michigan and Nevada, every fake elector is facing felony charges except one, whose charges were dropped in a cooperation deal. Their counterparts in New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin aren’t facing any charges. And in Georgia, three fake electors have been charged alongside Donald Trump, while others struck immunity deals.</p><p>Meanwhile, an architect of the scheme across all seven states, Wisconsin lawyer Kenneth Chesebro, has only received what some experts call a slap on the wrist after he reached a plea deal in Georgia, and he hasn’t been charged in any other state. The attorneys general in Georgia and Arizona are the only state prosecutors to charge any of the alleged organizers of the scheme. At the federal level, special counsel Jack Smith cited Trump’s involvement in the fake electors’ project in his Washington, D.C., case against him.<br /></p><br /><p>The wildly varying legal consequences for the fake electors have generated discomfort in some corners — especially since it appears many of the people Chesebro supervised may face much stiffer consequences than he will.</p><p>“In many instances, I actually think that the state-level electors themselves were the dupes in the fraud, rather than the fraudsters themselves,” said Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who has closely tracked the issue. “It’s so unusual to have this situation whereby it’s as though Kenneth Chesebro, the principal, is flipping on the subordinates — rather than the normal prosecutorial strategy of going up the chain of command.”</p><p>It’s the direct result of America’s “unusual” election system, according to Derek Muller, a professor at the University of Notre Dame’s law school.</p><p>“The presidential elections are really run by the states,” he said. “They are really decentralized. So as a result, you can have parallel behavior across different states and yet it’s not really governed by federal law; it’s really governed, at its heart, by state law, with all of the vagaries that state law might offer.”</p><p>A lawyer for Chesebro, meanwhile, said some of the fake electors went further than he’d wanted them to — enthusiastically claiming to be the real electors when they in fact weren’t.</p><p>“You can say he’s the architect or the planner,” said Robert Langford, who represents Chesebro. “But he never intended that these people would purport to be the real electors. In Michigan, Nevada, and Arizona, that’s exactly what they did. And that was the line that was crossed that resulted in criminality. In talking with the prosecutors, that was it.”</p><p>Chesebro, however, wrote a <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/chesebro-dec-6-memo/ce55d6abd79c2c71/full.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Dec. 6, 2020 memo&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/chesebro-dec-6-memo/ce55d6abd79c2c71/full.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4690000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4690001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Dec. 6, 2020 memo</a> arguing that Trump could use the existence of false slates of electors to foment challenges to Congress’ certification of the results on Jan. 6, 2021 — even if the slates weren’t certified by legislators or backed by court rulings. </p><h2 style="text-align: left">A seven-state scheme</h2><p>In the weeks following the 2020 election, Trump — egged on by Chesebro and other fringe advisers — helped assemble slates of Republican activists in seven states won by Joe Biden. In the midst of calling local election officials to pressure them to reject certification of the election results, Trump also checked in with then-RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel to enlist her help in the elector effort, and he connected her with attorney John Eastman, an architect of the strategy.</p><p>Under the Trump camp’s guidance, the would-be electors then prepared certificates claiming to be the states’ legitimate representatives in the Electoral College. In two states — New Mexico and Pennsylvania — the electors included conditional language stating that the validity of the certificates depended on court challenges.</p><p>Trump and his allies then pressured state lawmakers to endorse these fake slates in hopes of derailing the transfer of power to Biden — a desperate gambit that failed. And even after lawmakers refused to sign on, Trump allies promoted the “alternative” slates as a reason for then-Vice President Mike Pence to block Biden’s victory during the Jan. 6, 2021, session of Congress.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6308279933112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Investigators have since homed in on the elector strategy as a key piece of Trump’s effort to seize a second term he didn’t win. And the results have been mixed.</p><p>Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/18/michigan-ag-charges-16-gop-activists-who-falsely-claimed-to-be-electors-in-bid-to-aid-trump-00106928" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;charged all 16 fake electors&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/18/michigan-ag-charges-16-gop-activists-who-falsely-claimed-to-be-electors-in-bid-to-aid-trump-00106928&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4690002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4690003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">charged all 16 fake electors</a> in her state, though she later dropped charges against one of them. It’s unclear when the rest will go to trial.</p><p>Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/06/nevada-criminal-charges-trump-false-electors-2020-00130457" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;leveled charges against the six fake electors&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/06/nevada-criminal-charges-trump-false-electors-2020-00130457&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4690004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4690005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">leveled charges against the six fake electors</a> in his state, and a trial is scheduled for January 2025.</p><p>Neither Nessel nor Ford have charged any of the people who assembled the slates or crafted the strategy. But in Michigan, Nessel’s prosecution team recently revealed in court that they consider Trump himself to be an unindicted co-conspirator in the case. It’s unclear if that statement has any legal significance.</p><p>In Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis used her state’s general racketeering statute to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/14/fulton-county-trump-indictment-00111211" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;charge Trump and more than a dozen of his national and state allies&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/14/fulton-county-trump-indictment-00111211&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4690006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4690007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">charge Trump and more than a dozen of his national and state allies</a> in a broad criminal conspiracy to overturn his defeat in the state. Only three of the state’s 16 fake electors were charged. Willis offered immunity to at least eight others in exchange for their cooperation. There’s no trial date yet.</p><p>Arizona <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/24/arizona-election-indictments-giuliani-meadows-trump-00154241" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;forged a middle path last month&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/24/arizona-election-indictments-giuliani-meadows-trump-00154241&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4690008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4690009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">forged a middle path last month</a>, with Attorney General Kris Mayes charging all 11 false GOP electors, as well as seven of Trump’s national and state allies. But Mayes stopped short of charging Trump himself. Instead, her indictment named him as an unindicted co-conspirator in the scheme.</p><p>In Pennsylvania and New Mexico, Trump’s would-be electors insisted that the paperwork they signed included a caveat that said it would only become effective if a court ruled in their favor. That hedge <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/05/new-mexico-attorney-general-fake-gop-electors-cant-be-prosecuted-00134151" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;shielded them from criminal charges&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/05/new-mexico-attorney-general-fake-gop-electors-cant-be-prosecuted-00134151&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee469000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee469000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">shielded them from criminal charges</a>.</p><p>Wisconsin stands alone in the process. In recent days, the state’s attorney general Josh Kaul gave <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/26/wisconsin-could-prosecute-trump-2020-fake-electors/73452583007/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a vague statement to USA Today&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/26/wisconsin-could-prosecute-trump-2020-fake-electors/73452583007/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee469000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee469000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a vague statement to USA Today</a> saying he “believes that those who committed crimes in an effort to unlawfully subvert the outcome of an election should be held accountable.” But unlike Mayes in Arizona and Ford in Nevada, Kaul was attorney general in January 2021 — meaning he has had more than three years to decide whether to bring charges, and so far, he has not done so.</p><p>Lester Pines, a Wisconsin attorney who has worked for a host of liberal clients and causes, said no one in Madison’s close-knit legal community expects Kaul — a Democrat — to charge the fake electors with crimes.</p><p>“Why that is, none of us know,” Pines said. “He does not seem to be in the least bit motivated to do so, to the great disappointment of people who vote to elect attorneys general to enforce the law and to our Democrats.”</p><p>Kaul’s indecision is particularly notable because the longshot legal strategy behind the fake elector plot was hatched in Wisconsin, where Chesebro first drafted memos on it. Chesebro used his relationship with then-Trump campaign attorney Jim Troupis — another Badger Stater — to reach Trump’s national orbit and help lead the scheme.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">Architect remains mostly unscathed</h2><p>Most of the prosecutors who have investigated the aftermath of the 2020 election have taken a hands-off approach to Chesebro.</p><p>Smith, the special counsel helming the Justice Department’s probe, identified Chesebro as one of six unindicted co-conspirators in his indictment charging Trump with trying to steal the election and deprive Americans of the right to vote. Experts have told POLITICO they don’t expect Smith to bring charges against any of those co-conspirators — at least not anytime soon.</p><p>In Arizona, Chesebro also received unindicted co-conspirator status.</p><p>And in Georgia, he was indicted but <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/20/kenneth-chesebro-an-architect-of-trumps-fake-elector-scheme-pleads-guilty-in-georgia-00122758" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;negotiated a plea deal&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/20/kenneth-chesebro-an-architect-of-trumps-fake-elector-scheme-pleads-guilty-in-georgia-00122758&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee469000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4690010&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">negotiated a plea deal</a> that won’t result in jail time.</p><p>Chesebro has reportedly cooperated with prosecutors in Arizona and Nevada, which is not unusual for criminal suspects seeking leniency. But according to Goodman, the NYU law professor, it’s quite odd for prosecutors to enlist apparent ringleaders in order to charge the people they supervised. Instead, prosecutors generally work with a criminal scheme’s foot soldiers to build cases against the people who organized it — in other words, they go easy on the small fish so they can bag the big ones.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6339541311112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>That appears to be the strategy adopted in Georgia, with Willis using the cooperation of numerous fake electors to indict Trump and many of his top allies. But prosecutors in other states have not seemed to follow suit.</p><p>“How the prosecutors can justify using Kenneth Chesebro to go after the smaller fish is one of the lingering questions and, I think, concerns about how this has all proceeded,” Goodman said.</p><p>Chesebro’s attorney, Langford, told POLITICO that the fake electors face more political risk than his client because they went further than he wanted them to.</p><p>“A lot of behavior after Dec. 14, after they signed those ballots — especially in Nevada and Arizona, where they’re like, ‘We’re the real electors, those Democrats, they’re all fake, the election was stolen, and we’re the real ones!’ — that was not his plan,” Langford said.</p><p>The fake electors who have now been charged may face severe penalties. In Arizona, they could face more than 12 years in prison, according to defense attorney Omer Gurion, who doesn’t have any clients in the case. He added that first-time offenders in the state usually get probation.</p><p>But, he continued, the fake electors case is extremely unusual. “So I think it’s a bit of a crapshoot in predicting a sentence,” he said.</p><p>In Georgia, the three fake electors who were charged could face 20 years for their role in the alleged racketeering conspiracy, though sentences well below the maximum are most likely for defendants with no prior criminal record. They also face charges with maximum penalties of five, 10 and 15 years for signing the false documents. That’s left Georgia with the widest range of potential outcomes, from modest jail time to decades behind bars.</p><p>The Nevada defendants, meanwhile, could face five years in prison at the most. But, according to former Nevada U.S. Attorney Greg Brower, it’s most likely that a judge would sentence them to one year in prison but suspend that sentence and let them out on probation.</p><p>“There’s no victim in the traditional sense, there’s no restitution to be paid, it’s not a crime of violence,” he said.</p><p>In Michigan, according to defense lawyer Maurice Davis, the fake electors could face a maximum of 14 years of incarceration. Davis added that the judge handling the proceedings will have broad discretion to decide whether to hand down jail time or just probation. But he said he expects some incarceration.</p><p>“The conduct was pretty egregious,” he said. “It was a conspiracy to subvert an election in the highest form. I don’t think we’ve ever seen anything like this in the history of our democracy. Given the unique nature and the potential consequences had they been successful, I would be surprised if a judge did not give them some form of jail time.”<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

It ultimately produced a <a href="https://mcusercontent.com/cc1fad182b6d6f8b1e352e206/files/fa85cddf-ccc6-7dee-dd58-ff5e80d53b15/Indictment.03.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;58-page indictment&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mcusercontent.com/cc1fad182b6d6f8b1e352e206/files/fa85cddf-ccc6-7dee-dd58-ff5e80d53b15/Indictment.03.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee46e0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee46e0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">58-page indictment</a> last month that charged national and state Republicans — including one of Trump’s current top advisers and several former members of his inner circle — with felonies for their alleged roles in the effort to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the state. Trump himself was listed as an unindicted co-conspirator.</p><p>Documents reviewed by POLITICO reveal that at least two of the 18 people charged — former Trump lawyers Jenna Ellis and Christina Bobb — were assured by prosecutors that they were not targets of the probe, only to learn that the grand jury indicted them anyway. In fact, a letter that a prosecutor sent to Ellis just days before the indictment appeared to significantly understate her legal jeopardy.</p><p>One witness who testified before the grand jury said a faction of the panel drove intense questioning that exceeded the limited scope that prosecutors had publicly acknowledged. The probe was led by the office of Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes.</p><p>Arizona law tightly restricts any discussion of grand jury proceedings, and most of the people interviewed by POLITICO were granted anonymity to describe the inner workings.</p><p>Though Republicans have accused Mayes, a Democrat, of bringing an unfair and politically motivated case, the people who described the investigation to POLITICO said the grand jury was surprisingly independent of prosecutors –– and sometimes even hard for them to predict.</p><p>“The State Grand Jury was given leeway to conduct an independent investigation, as it is entitled to do by law,” Mayes’ spokesperson, Richie Taylor, said in a statement. “I cannot confirm or deny the specifics of grand jury proceedings, and I will note that the investigation remains open and ongoing. I will have to decline to comment further.”</p><p>Grand juries, like trial juries, consist of ordinary people who are randomly called to serve. By law, they are independent — empowered to conduct their own lines of questioning and to reach conclusions that may not align with the wishes of investigators — but in run-of-the-mill criminal cases, they are often wholly deferential to the prosecutors who empanel them.</p><p>In newsworthy or politically sensitive probes, however, it’s more common for grand juries to take on an independent role, according to Paul Charlton, a former Arizona prosecutor.</p><p>“Every high-profile case that I’ve ever had, which is cases that have necessarily attendant publicity, or a public corruption case, or anything else, grand jurors become interested,” he said.</p><p>Ultimately, the Arizona grand jury investigating the 2020 election indicted former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, and close Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn. It also indicted the 11 Arizona Republicans who falsely claimed to be the state’s rightful presidential electors.</p><p>Arizona is the fourth state — after Georgia, Michigan and Nevada — to bring criminal charges stemming from the efforts of Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 results in states that Biden won. At the federal level, special counsel Jack Smith has also charged Trump himself for the scheme.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">An aggressive grand jury</h2><p>Mayes succeeded a Republican in January 2023 after campaigning on a promise to investigate the so-called “fake electors” that falsely claimed Trump had prevailed in Arizona’s 2020 contest. Her office began the probe early in her term, and Mayes confirmed her focus on the elector scheme repeatedly in interviews throughout 2023.</p><p>“I have been clear that we are conducting an investigation into the fake elector situation here in Arizona,” Mayes <a href="https://www.azfamily.com/2023/11/10/arizona-ag-announces-robust-investigation-into-fake-electors/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;said in an August 2023 radio interview&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.azfamily.com/2023/11/10/arizona-ag-announces-robust-investigation-into-fake-electors/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee46e0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee46e0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">said in an August 2023 radio interview</a>.</p><p>But a year into her tenure, as the grand jury <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/06/donald-trump-2020-election-probe-arizona-00145377" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;fired off a series of subpoenas&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/06/donald-trump-2020-election-probe-arizona-00145377&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee46e0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee46e0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">fired off a series of subpoenas</a>, there were signs that the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/04/biggs-gosar-arizona-subpoenas-00150416" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;scope of the probe was broader than that&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/04/biggs-gosar-arizona-subpoenas-00150416&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee46e0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee46e0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">scope of the probe was broader than that</a>.</p><p>For months, the panel met regularly in a drab, white-walled basement room of the Maricopa County Superior Courthouse. There, grand jurors and prosecutors discussed which witnesses to summon, which subpoenas to issue and the lines of inquiry the investigation should pursue.</p><p>When witnesses appeared, jurors would sit in desks arranged in a U-shape to face witnesses, who sat alongside a court reporter and prosecutors. The jurors toted binders of evidence and notebooks, and prosecutors would display exhibits on a television screen.</p><p>People familiar with the investigation noted that the grand jurors had a range of political and ideological viewpoints. There appeared to be a faction that drove the most aggressive questions, while others inquired from different points of view. Occasionally, some would roll their eyes or sigh audibly during others’ inquiries.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">‘Not a target’</h2><p>Several months after Ellis, one of the Trump lawyers, pleaded guilty in Georgia to aiding Trump’s quest to subvert the 2020 election, Mayes’ prosecutors approached her with questions of their own. They asked her to appear for an interview in their office to determine whether they might benefit from her cooperation, a so-called “free talk” interview.</p><p>“Ms. Ellis is not a target of the State’s investigation,” a prosecutor in Mayes’ office wrote in the Feb. 20 letter to Ellis’ lawyer that also proposed terms for an interview.</p><p>On April 19, the prosecutor followed up with another version of the same letter working to arrange an interview, reiterating that Ellis was not a target of their probe.</p><p>Four days later, the grand jury indicted her. The interview never happened.</p><p>Ellis and her legal team declined to comment.</p><p>Omer Gurion, a Phoenix criminal defense lawyer who does not have any clients connected to the probe, said the events regarding Ellis were unheard of, given that she could have sat for a free-talk interview under the false impression she wouldn’t face charges.</p><p>“I have never seen anything like that in any Arizona criminal case that I can think of,” he said. “Not one.”</p><p>He added that for a person to go from being untargeted to indicted in just four days is technically possible but “pretty unusual.”</p><p>Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, concurred.</p><p>“It’s bad form, and something I would never do as a prosecutor,” he said. “That said, I’ve practiced criminal law across this country and gone up against prosecutors of all stripes, and I’ve learned there are many prosecutors who do things I would not do.”</p><p>Charlton, the former Arizona prosecutor, also agreed that the Ellis episode was unusual.</p><p>“It is peculiar,” he said. “It may have a very reasonable explanation –– you certainly hope it does. But at the end of the day, the prejudice that she suffers seems marginal, only because she never participated in the discussion with them.”</p><p>Bobb, a lawyer who worked on Trump’s efforts to fight his 2020 defeat and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/04/26/christina-bobb-arizona-charges-rnc-election-integrity/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;now works for the RNC&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/04/26/christina-bobb-arizona-charges-rnc-election-integrity/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee46e000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee46e000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">now works for the RNC</a> on election integrity issues, also received a letter from prosecutors two months before the indictment. Hers, dated Feb. 28 and reviewed by POLITICO, said she was “not a person under investigation by the State Grand Jury.” Her lawyer, Thomas Jacobs, confirmed she received the letter attached to a subpoena for testimony.</p><p>Less than two months after receiving the letter, Bobb was also indicted.</p><p>Gurion was skeptical that prosecutors didn’t know she was under investigation just two months before her indictment.</p><p>“I cannot imagine that they didn’t know that she was being investigated and was going to be mentioned to the grand jury two months prior,” he said. “That doesn’t make sense.”</p><p>“This timeline is troubling,” he added.</p><p>Mariotti also said he had never seen anything like it.</p><p>“In my over 20 years practicing criminal law, I’ve never encountered someone who was a witness being indicted less than two months later, who was told in writing that they’re a witness and not under investigation,” he said.</p><p>Charlton, meanwhile, said the prosecutors could have gathered new evidence between the date of the letter and the indictment that resulted in their decision to charge Bobb.</p><p>“I assume these are prosecutors who are acting in good faith,” he said, “and absent any proof to the contrary, that’s what I would say they were doing.”</p><h2 style="text-align: left">A grill session</h2><p>One of the witnesses who spoke to POLITICO underscored the divergence between the grand jurors and prosecutors. The witness, who received an immunity agreement over the winter, was told to expect roughly an hour of questioning on some boilerplate details of the probe.</p><p>Instead, grand jurors grilled the witness for three hours, sometimes in pointed and accusatory ways — “a level of aggression that caught me off guard.” The witness recalled a juror who “seemed to be the leader of the ‘indict them all crowd’ and asked ‘pointed but specific questions.’” Another grand juror asked “more high-level questions” like, “How could you even talk to these people? What were you thinking?” with long “preambles” that made his views of the case known, the witness said.</p><p>Another smaller faction of grand jurors consistently reframed the questions of the more aggressive jurors and seemed to be more skeptical of the angle they were taking, the witness recalled, noting that this group was visibly “rolling their eyes, heavy sighing, shifting uncomfortably."</p><p>One grand juror also wanted to know what the witness could possibly have been thinking in the weeks after Trump’s defeat. The witness wasn’t a target but left the room surprised by the tenor of the grand jury’s questions and feeling like a “punching bag.”</p><p>And after the grilling was over, the witness said, a prosecutor offered a sheepish apology for its unexpected intensity.</p><p>Charlton said grand jurors tend to listen passively while prosecutors question witnesses during their sessions. You could present them with 100 bank robbery cases and get nothing but yawns, he added. But when they are investigating public corruption and newsworthy events, they are much more likely to take a hands-on approach.</p><p>In the months before the indictment, the grand jury subpoenaed many of the people who would later be charged for signing false documents claiming to be legitimate presidential electors. Lawyers for those people told the prosecutors that their clients would assert their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if required to appear before the grand jury –– declining to share anything at all of substance.</p><p>Typically when witnesses say they plan to invoke a constitutional privilege, prosecutors will excuse them from appearing. But in this case, grand jurors insisted that fake electors appear in person to plead the Fifth, so prosecutors <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/28/arizona-fake-electors-grand-jury-plead-fifth-00149605" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;ordered them to do so&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/28/arizona-fake-electors-grand-jury-plead-fifth-00149605&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee46e000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee46e000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">ordered them to do so</a>.

And Congress is urging them on, with legislation in the works to help hospitals expand their at-home offerings and to allow Medicare to continue paying for telehealth after lawmakers first granted temporary permission after Covid struck.</p><p>The appeal to lawmakers is potential savings if remote care proves more efficient, but hospitals also see financial advantage.</p><p>“It's a real game changer for us” and “one of the silver linings to the pandemic,” John Couris, president and CEO of the Florida Health Sciences Center in Tampa, said of Congress’ support for remote care. "We're all trying to diversify our revenue streams.”</p><p>And it’s bipartisan. <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_118_HR_8261?activeTabs=overview" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;House legislation&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_118_HR_8261?activeTabs=overview&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4750000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4750001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">House legislation</a> that would extend loosened pandemic rules for telehealth and hospital care at home won unanimous approval in the Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday.

The American Hospital Association points to costs rising at the same time the sector operated in the red every month of 2022. Margins have improved since, but not enough for hospital leaders to take comfort in the status quo.</p><p>The leaders of the movement to remote care, as one would expect, are the hospitals with the financial wherewithal to pursue it. </p><p>That could forebode an even bigger split between the haves and have-nots.</p><p>The well-heeled systems are also thinking about how they can sell their innovations, such as proprietary artificial intelligence products, to other hospitals and health care providers.</p><p>It all adds up to what could be a major transformation in the way the hospital business works — with implications for patient comfort, quality of care and cost.<br /></p><br /><p>Washington is supporting the shift with its own goals in mind. Lawmakers and administration officials are quick to tout their policies to Americans who see remote care as a way to avoid the grueling inpatient experience.</p><p>Government leaders are also adding up the potential savings for health programs that have seen costs balloon over the last decade with no signs of stopping.</p><p>The hope is that recovering at home will be less expensive than inpatient care. The impact of telehealth on the cost of care is being closely studied by tech companies, providers and government analysts, as it has the potential to reduce expenses but also could lead to more visits, driving up costs.</p><p>"The question is, how now do we get some of those things that were tried and demonstrated to work [in the pandemic] extended?” Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51242" data-person-id="51242" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715372660943,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000187-1473-d989-a7a7-bfffa9da0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715372660943,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000187-1473-d989-a7a7-bfffa9da0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;51242\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51242\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Sen.

The last couple of years for the sector have been very challenging,” Kevin Holloran, a senior director at Fitch Ratings, said on a call earlier this year about the financial state of nonprofit hospitals, which make up half of the total enrolled in Medicare. “For a lot of people — not everybody, but a lot of people — this is going to be another kind of make-or-break year.“</p><p>And for many hospitals, he suggested, the answer to that challenge is clear:</p><p>“Transformational change is needed.”</p><h2 style="text-align: left">Remote care’s value</h2><p>The pandemic forced hospitals to innovate, as they sought to keep their beds clear for Covid patients. Congress helped by flooding them with financial aid and by agreeing to pay doctors and hospitals for telehealth for Medicare patients. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued rules to allow more care at home. That can run the gamut, from post-surgery observation to obstetrics checkups, behavioral therapy and even care for acute illness.</p><p>Adopting remote care early in the pandemic was, for many providers, the only way to continue their services and keep the doors open. For hospitals overrun with Covid patients, the tech offered a way to offload some of the demand — a feature that remains a major selling point to systems seeing demand for some services rebound.</p><p>Congress offered supplemental funding for providers amid the unusual revenue cycle. But as the aid dried up and costs continued to rise, systems increasingly saw expanding care away from the hospital as a way to improve their finances.</p><p>Projections for the telehealth market <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10425816/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;suggest continued growth&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10425816/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4770002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4770003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">suggest continued growth</a> over the coming decade, supported by research that found remote care <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9290332/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;utilization remained elevated&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9290332/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4770004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4770005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">utilization remained elevated</a> well <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/7d6b4989431f4c70144f209622975116/household-pulse-survey-telehealth-covid-ib.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;beyond the early days&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/7d6b4989431f4c70144f209622975116/household-pulse-survey-telehealth-covid-ib.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4770006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4770007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">beyond the early days</a> of the pandemic.

The Ways and Means bill included a five-year extension and <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_118_S_3756?q=%22At+HOME+Services+Act+of+2024%22" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;legislation is pending&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_118_S_3756?q=%22At+HOME+Services+Act+of+2024%22&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4780000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4780001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">legislation is pending</a> before the Senate Finance Committee. A new, more expansive version is expected in the Senate this month.</p><p>Couris touted home-based care as not only more efficient but also higher quality, saying a small study at his organization found similar patients had significantly lower readmission rates when they were getting care through the hospital-at-home program. His own daughter has gotten hospital care at home.</p><p>“The standards are just as high as they are in the hospital because they're registered as a hospital patient,” he said. “We have to follow a set of hospital rules.”</p><h2 style="text-align: left">The high-tech future</h2><p>Rapid developments in technology are driving hospitals’ transition.</p><p>During the pandemic, many health systems invested in the networks, sensors and infrastructure to support remote care, whether privacy law-compliant check-ins or new staffing models for patients getting hospital care at home.</p><p>Sensors that enable staff to monitor patients remotely are less intrusive than they once were, meaning more patients comply with wearing them. That enables care providers to watch over someone from afar, Jiang Li, CEO of remote care company Vivalink, said.</p><p>“Almost everybody's thinking about how to make adjustments to embrace new technology,” Li said. “This trend definitely will continue — it will continue on a global scale, not just the U.S.”</p><p>Most providers have <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/2023-healthcare-provider-it-report-doubling-down-on-innovation/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;increased their spending&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.bain.com/insights/2023-healthcare-provider-it-report-doubling-down-on-innovation/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4780002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4780003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">increased their spending</a> on technology in recent years, including an emphasis on telehealth and remote care, according to a 2023 report.</p><p>Health regulators are taking note — and engaging in the conversation.</p><p>Dr. Meena Seshamani, deputy administrator and director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a statement that the agency “continually assesses opportunities" to better the speed and reliability of care, including via technology. That assessment includes discussions “with the medical community and patient advocates on an ongoing basis.”</p><p>Some large hospitals are essentially opening tech consulting operations, selling the systems they’ve built in-house, or their staff’s expertise.</p><p>“You're finding more health systems say: ‘What else could we do that is not necessarily wildly profitable but that just covers its own costs plus a little bit so that we can turn around and do other things?’” said Niyum Gandhi, chief financial officer and treasurer at Mass General Brigham.</p><p>Mass General, a major Boston hospital system, has done just that. It created an artificial intelligence business, relying on tech industry players, from GE HealthCare to Nvidia, to validate its tools. The health system, like other large health providers, is building its own AI products too, with some seeing opportunities to license them to peers.</p><p>That’s not a business plan just anyone can pursue.</p><p>In underserved areas, care options are shrinking.

The approach sometimes <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20140207-ukraine-usa-eu-nuland-leaked-audio" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;got her in trouble&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.france24.com/en/20140207-ukraine-usa-eu-nuland-leaked-audio&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4810000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4810001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">got her in trouble</a>, but it rarely held her back. </p><p>Nuland recently left the State Department after serving at its highest levels, first as the Biden administration’s undersecretary of State for political affairs, and, for several months, acting deputy secretary of State. She previously was a career diplomat who held an array of roles under presidents both Republican and Democratic; her first posting more than three decades ago was as a consular officer in China.</p><p>In an exit interview with POLITICO Magazine, Nuland discussed her time in public service — dismissing chatter that she was passed over for a promotion — as well as her views on where American foreign policy has gone wrong and right. </p><p>Notably, she said the United States was not quick enough to realize and prevent the expansionist ambitions of both Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. </p><p>A longtime champion of Ukraine and the effort to counter Russia, she also warned about the perils of Donald Trump blowing up NATO if he wins back the White House in November. </p><p>“Don’t throw it out,” she said of the trans-Atlantic alliance, “because you would never be able to re-create it again.” </p><p><i>The following has been edited for length and clarity:</i><b>&#xa0;</b></p><p><b>How’s life on the outside?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Life is wonderful. I am doing a lot of projects that I had put off, seeing a lot of people that I love, and I’m staying involved in ways that are meaningful. I’m speaking on foreign policy issues I care about — whether it is Ukraine or ensuring that the United States leads strongly in the world. I’m getting a chance to prepare for my classes in the fall and work with the next generation of foreign policy leaders. I’ll be at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs. </p><p><b>Why leave the Biden administration, really? People said you felt passed over for the deputy secretary of State job. Is that true?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I actually didn’t compete for the deputy secretary of State job. I loved being undersecretary for political affairs. I love working with Secretary [Antony] Blinken. But as you know, I’ve done three years altogether and I’ve done eight months plus in both jobs, and so it was just the right time for me and my family to do something different. </p><p><b>Do you have any regrets from your time in the role?</b></p><p>I think whenever you finish a job like this, you wish you’d been able to do more on more issues. Travel more, touch more people, get more done faster, ensure the U.S. was leading strongly on as many continents as possible, mentor more of the next generation. And you’re always constrained by time, by resources, by the crises that overwhelm the inbox. So you always want to have done more. </p><p><b>Can Ukraine win this war against Russia? And how do you define winning?</b> </p><p>Let’s start with the fact that Putin has already failed in his objective. He wanted to flatten Ukraine. He wanted to ensure that they had no sovereignty, independence, agency, no democratic future — because a democratic Ukraine, a European Ukraine, is a threat to his model for Russia, among other things, and because it’s the first building block for his larger territorial ambitions. </p><p>Can Ukraine succeed? Absolutely. Can Ukraine come out of this more sovereign, more economically independent, stronger, more European than it is now? Absolutely. And I think it will. But we’ve got to stay with it. We’ve got to make sure our allies stay with it. </p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/f8/76/0f016aa045258539dc868670ba5e/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1458232004" /><br /><p><br />And we have to accelerate a lot of the initiatives that were in the supplemental, like helping Ukraine build that highly deterrent military force of the future, like deploying these longer-range weapons to strategic effect, like ensuring that the critical infrastructure and the energy sector are protected, like building up our own defense industrial base and that of our allies and Ukraine’s again, so that we and Ukraine are building faster than Russia and China. </p><p><b>But can it get all its territory back, including Crimea?</b> </p><p>It can definitely get to a place where it’s strong enough, I believe, and where Putin is stymied enough to go to the negotiating table from a position of strength. It’ll be up to the Ukrainian people what their territorial ambitions should be. But there are certain things that are existential. </p><p>Any deal that they cut in their interest and in the larger global interest has to be a deal that Putin is compelled to stick to. We can’t be doing this every six months, every three years. It has to actually lead to a deal that includes Russian withdrawal. </p><p>Putin is a master at what we call rope-a-dope negotiating, where he never actually cuts the deal. It has to be a deal that ensures that whatever is decided on Crimea, it can’t be remilitarized such that it’s a dagger at the heart of the center of Ukraine. </p><p><b>Was it a mistake not to push the Ukrainians harder to go for some sort of negotiated end to the war in 2022, especially the fall of 2022?</b> </p><p>They were not in a strong enough position then. They’re not in a strong enough position now. The only deal Putin would have cut then, the only deal that he would cut today, at least before he sees what happens in our election, is a deal in which he says, “What’s mine is mine and what’s yours is negotiable.” And that’s not sustainable. </p><p><b>You’ve had a long career, especially when it comes to Europe. Where did the U.S. go wrong in its understanding of Russia?</b> </p><p>With regard to both Russia and China, after the end of the Cold War, the prevailing wisdom among all of us — right, left and center — was that if you could knit Moscow and Beijing into the open and free global order that we had benefited from for so many years, that they would become prosperous, and they would become strong contributing members of that order. And that’s what we tried for a very long time. </p><p>That works if you have a leadership that is fundamentally accepting the current system. But once you have leaders who are telling their populations that this system keeps their country down, doesn’t allow it to have its rightful place, that has a territorial definition of greatness, that is bent on economic, political and or military coercion — that’s antithetical to this order, and then our policy has to change. </p><p>Did we realize fast enough Putin’s ambitions and Xi Jinping’s ambitions, and did we do enough to ensure that those ambitions stayed inside their own nations and didn’t spill out and coerce others? 20/20 hindsight? Probably not. </p><p><b>How much of it comes down to what particular guy is running the show? I sometimes wonder, could things be different if it wasn’t Putin in charge? If it wasn't Xi? How much of it comes down to the dude at the top?</b> </p><p>In highly centralized societies, which both China and Russia have historically been, without an electoral refresh of the kind that we all go through in the democratic world, it matters hugely, because it’s that human who’s defining what greatness means. It’s that human who’s deciding how to maintain order in that society. It’s that human — allowing them to speak, allowing a free press, allowing protests, allowing alternative political parties — who’s going to shape the options. And that constrains obviously the kind of relationship we can have. </p><p><b>What is the lesson we should learn about foreign policy in general when it comes to the experiences we’ve had in Russia and China?</b> </p><p>We should always try to talk both to leaders and to people, to the extent that we’re allowed. We should always offer an opportunity to work together in common interest. </p> <p>But if the ideology is inherently expansionist, is inherently illiberal, is inherently trying to change the system that benefits us, we’ve got to build protections and resilience for ourselves, for our friends and allies, and particularly for those neighbors of those countries who are likely to be on the front line of that first push.</p><br /><p><b>Where do you see the Israel-Hamas war heading?</b> </p><p>Essentially, there are two paths on the table. There is continuing this war with all of the destruction and horror and lack of clarity about how you end Hamas’ reign of terror. </p><p>The other path is the route that the administration and allies and partners and a lot of countries in the Gulf are pushing, and a lot of Israelis want, which is: a hostage deal leads to a long-term cease-fire, leads to a better future for Palestinians both in the West Bank and in Gaza, leads to Saudi-Israel normalization and a path to two states, and a region where the ideology and the violence that Hamas is offering is beaten by more opening, more opportunity, more peace, more stability. </p><p><b>Are you saying that because you believe it or because it’s the Biden administration’s position?</b> </p><p>I’m saying it because, anything other than that, this is going to happen again and again and again. </p><p><b>If you could go back in time on that one, what, if anything, should the U.S. have done differently?</b> </p><p>Beginning with the Trump administration, everybody fell in love with regional normalization as the cure-all for the instability and grievances and insecurity in the Middle East. And that’s a part of it. </p><p>But if you leave out the Palestinian issue, then somebody’s going to seize it and run with it, and that’s what Hamas did. I also think that both we and the Israelis knew too little about the terror state that had been established in Gaza. </p><p><b>You’re going to be teaching at Columbia, the epicenter of campus protests over this situation. If you could offer these protesters some advice as someone with significant policymaking experience, what would it be?</b> </p><p>Peaceful protest is part of the fabric of who we are and the fact that we allow it, and the Chinese don’t and the Russians don’t, makes us Americans. But when that protest becomes violent, when it impinges on other people’s human rights or denigrates others, then you veer toward coercion. </p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352186801112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><br />So, express your views, ask for concrete paths forward. But stay away from violence, make sure that it’s actually indigenous to the campus, that you’re not becoming the tool of outside agitators. And be respectful of alternative views as you expect people to respect your views. </p><p><b>What if you are peaceful? And you say what you want and the people in charge just say, ‘Oh, that’s very nice, thank you,’ and then they ignore you and they keep doing what they’ve been doing for years. How do you do just keep pushing on that front? Do you join the government?</b> </p><p>I would certainly say if you care enough to devote all day, every day to political change, come join the folks who are setting policy, commit your life to public service. I didn’t expect that that’s where my life would lead, but it’s been incredibly rewarding. </p><p>There are many, many ways to change policy, but being on the inside is not only extremely rewarding, but you can actually get stuff done. </p><p><b>If Trump wins, and leaves NATO or limits America’s role in NATO, does the alliance fall apart? What happens?</b> </p><p>First and foremost, America suffers. Because if you look at every single one of the challenges we have globally, even as we make the security commitment to Europe, it is the European countries who have contributed more to Ukraine — on the security side, on the economic side, etc. It is the European countries who have to adapt their policies toward China if you want to have an impact on China’s eagerness to coerce others. It’s the European countries who we need to help fund the Haiti mission, to help defeat terrorism in Africa, and provide prosperity. </p><p>If we are not part of that family, on a daily basis, we are standing alone, our own influence in the world is greatly reduced, and we have no influence over how they choose to spend their energy and resources. And they’re less powerful in doing it without us. </p><p><b>What about this idea that look, we’re the U.S. at the end of the day. We’re the superpower. Whether we’re in NATO or not, people are going to come along with us. Isn’t there something to that argument?</b> </p><p>I’ve worked for six presidents, Republicans and Democrats. I always believed that a new president with a fresh mandate from the American people should look at every global problem with fresh eyes, bring new solutions, and should have that opportunity, working with Congress, working with the American people, working with allies and partners. </p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/67/dc/fa06a6f441f8b1a974cd879bada8/u-s-congress-08624.jpg" /><br /><p><br />That’s a different thing than turning your back on bedrock, bipartisan institutions and policies that have protected Americans and advanced our own prosperity and global influence for 70 years. </p><p>Why do you want to throw out what’s working and what benefits us for no other reason than you’ve had a fit of pique? Work within the institution to make it work better. Don’t throw it out, because you would never be able to re-create it again. </p><p><b>Does the rest of the world fear the United States?</b> </p><p>Is fear what we want from the rest of the world? </p><p><b>Sometimes.</b> </p><p>I think what we want from the rest of the world is they see us leading in a manner that advances their own security, advances their own prosperity, creates this community of nations that can handle global problems — whether they are terrorist problems, whether they are health problems, whether they’re environmental problems — and we do it in a primarily self-interested but unselfish way, and we’re creating that community. </p><p>They should only fear us if they’re opponents of a largely liberal democratic way of advancing human prosperity. And in that context, if they are viciously invading a neighbor, if they are coercing a little state because they can, then I hope they would fear our reaction and the reaction that we will build with other democracies who want to protect the system that favors freedom. </p><p><b>Do you ever plan to go back into government?</b> </p><p>I love what I did for 35 years. I’ve always loved it. And I continue to love it. So in the right circumstances, of course.</p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

And Monday is set to be another big day at the courthouse, when Trump’s former fixer Michael Cohen is expected to take the stand.</p><p>But Trump on Saturday avoided mentioning the witnesses or jurors in the case, likely aware that any public attack would violate the gag order imposed by Justice Juan Merchan. While Merchan already held Trump in contempt for violating the order 10 times and fined him a total of $10,000, the judge also threatened Trump last week with jail time for future violations.</p><p>Surrounded by roller coasters and amusement park thrills along a boardwalk in Wildwood, the former president railed against the trial that has largely taken him off the campaign trail. This was only the third rally Trump has held since the case began almost one month ago.</p><p>But in recent events, Trump has been escalating his attacks on the justice system and Biden. During <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/05/trump-retreat-biden-2024-elections-00156171" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>a private donor retreat last week&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/05/trump-retreat-biden-2024-elections-00156171&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4880002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4880003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>a private donor retreat last week</u></a> in Palm Beach, Trump accused Biden of “running a Gestapo administration.” And on Saturday, he said the president is “surrounded by fascists around the Oval Office."</p><p>“All of this persecution is only happening because I’m running for president. If I wasn’t leading in the polls by a lot and running for president, they wouldn’t be after me. I’d have a nice place. I’d be down in Palm Beach. I’d be traveling the world,” Trump said, before repeating falsehoods about the 2020 election that he lost to Biden.</p><p>During the speech, Trump threw well-worn lines on the border, windmills and electric vehicles, China and migrants. And he compared himself to the infamous gangster Al Capone, which has become a regular bit on the campaign trail.</p><p>“Al Capone was so mean that if you went to dinner with him and he didn’t like you, you’d be dead the next morning. And I got indicted more than him. On bullshit, too. Just bullshit,” Trump said. The crowd erupted into cheers of “bullshit.”</p><p>While Trump hit many familiar targets in his speech — like criticizing countries for not contributing more to NATO — he also attacked Biden over his pledge to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/08/biden-says-u-s-will-cut-off-offensive-weapons-to-israel-if-they-go-into-rafah-00156943" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>withhold weapons from Israel&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/08/biden-says-u-s-will-cut-off-offensive-weapons-to-israel-if-they-go-into-rafah-00156943&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4880004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4880005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>withhold weapons from Israel</u></a> if it launches any assaults on the highly populated city of Rafah.

Russia and China we can handle, but these lunatics within our government that are going to destroy our country, we have to get it stopped,” Trump said. “They’re not on the right, they’re on the left.”<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/a1/24/41623f3646d0b4a3f9233e7ba492/election-2024-trump-71479.jpg" /><br /><p>Trump was met with a massive crowd of supporters in Wildwood, who waited in lawn chairs outside the event for days, according to local media. One local official told the Associated Press that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-new-jersey-president-trial-gag-order-59a8073e5a22f7a1e13f1461e9998419" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>there were approximately 80,000 people in attendance&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-new-jersey-president-trial-gag-order-59a8073e5a22f7a1e13f1461e9998419&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4880008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4880009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>there were approximately 80,000 people in attendance</u></a>.

Doug Burgum, a former presidential challenger-turned top surrogate and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/09/doug-burgum-trump-vice-president-00156922" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>vice presidential contender&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/09/doug-burgum-trump-vice-president-00156922&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee488000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee488000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>vice presidential contender</u></a>, and Christian Craighead, a former British Special Air Service operative and hero in the 2019 Nairobi terrorist attack, introduced Trump.</p><p>“Who are we going to send back to the White House — Trump!” Burgum said.</p><p>While the court proceedings have put a damper on Trump’s campaigning, he has held campaign events in Michigan and Wisconsin as well as fundraisers and campaign events at his private club in Florida.</p><p>Trump lost the historically Democratic state of New Jersey to Joe Biden in 2020 by 16 points, but the rally was held in an area that has leaned Republican. Cape May County, where Wildwood is located, voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020.</p><p>It’s also an area that attracts residents — and media attention — from the battleground state of Pennsylvania and it is a quick trip from New York, where Trump has been spending four days a week inside a chilly courtroom over charges he falsified business records to cover up an alleged affair with Daniels ahead of the 2016 election.</p><p>Trump was visibly frustrated with Daniels’ testimony last week in court, where she described in embarrassing detail their alleged sexual encounter. Next week, Cohen — Trump’s former attorney and closest aide turned public antagonist — will be taking the stand to discuss his involvement in making the hush money payment to Daniels and orchestrating her payouts. In 2018 Cohen was charged with campaign finance violations, tax fraud and bank fraud, and was sentenced to three years in prison.</p><p>While Trump was stumping on the East Coast, Biden was making his pitch to donors on the West Coast with fundraising stops in San Francisco and Seattle on Friday and Saturday.</p><p>Ahead of Trump’s rally, Biden’s campaign and surrogates knocked his visit to New Jersey and his team’s recent assertion that they believe states like Minnesota and Virginia are in play. They also took a jab at Trump’s plans to campaign in New York.</p><p>“They’re talking about holding concerts in Madison Square Garden to turn out voters in states like New York and here, on planet Earth, in the Biden campaign, we’re going to remain laser focused on the pathway to 270 electoral votes,” Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler told reporters on Friday.</p><p>“We’re focused on communicating directly with the voters who are actually going to decide this presidential election,” he continued. “So, no matter where the Trump team decides they want to spend their time, the fact of the matter is, as I said at the top of this call, they do not have the infrastructure to reach the voters who are going to decide this election.”</p><p>Trump on Saturday also went after some of New Jersey’s most famous residents, including Bruce Springsteen and former Gov. Chris Christie. Trump claimed he attracted a bigger crowd than Springsteen, and invited the crowd to boo Christie, a former Trump ally turned critic.</p><p>“Does anybody like Chris Christie?” Trump said, before calling Christie “unhinged” and suffering from a major case of Trump derangement syndrome.”</p><p><i>Elena Schneider contributed to this story.</i><br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

Kennedy Jr.’s running mate launched her campaign trail debut in Texas — but for most of the event, Nicole Shanahan was literally out of the spotlight.</p><p>Despite being the marquee guest for a criminal justice reform panel discussion at the LOV3 nightclub, she and her husband sat in a booth next to the DJ’s setup, off stage and out of frame of the cameras. When she did take the stage, she spoke for less than 15 minutes before taking audience questions.</p><p>“What I’m realizing now is this campaign is so much bigger than anything I could have imagined,” Shanahan told the crowd of about 40 people that included campaign volunteers.</p><p>The tech entrepreneur and former Democratic Party donor has been dogged with criticisms that her main asset to the independent presidential campaign is her personal wealth. Since being named on the ticket in late March, she has limited her public exposure to friendly podcast interviews, virtual events and social media posts.</p><p>Shanahan’s first in-person, solo campaign stop is unlikely to persuade skeptics.</p><p>The event, organized by Angela Stanton King, a Kennedy campaign consultant who worked for Donald Trump’s campaign last cycle, had minimal production and fanfare.</p><p>Unlike Kennedy’s campaign events, this panel skipped the video trailer that usually proceeds Kennedy’s walk out on stage as well as the typical security presence from <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/20/robert-kennedy-jr-security-debt-fec-00148149" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>Gavin de Becker &amp; Associates&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/20/robert-kennedy-jr-security-debt-fec-00148149&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee48c0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee48c0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>Gavin de Becker &amp; Associates</u></a> staff, who flank Kennedy and screen attendees. After the event, Shanahan did not stay for a selfie line, instead she was whisked away by a white SUV.</p><p>“We are so honored to have our VP here in attendance and listening,” said Angela Stanton King, the event's emcee and a consultant for the Kennedy campaign.</p><p>Stanton King billed the panel event, which included a child support reform activist and her former co-star on a BET reality show, as the first in a criminal justice reform-focused tour for the Kennedy campaign.</p><p>Shananhan’s remarks were light on policy, but included admiration for Stanton King’s anti-abortion views.</p><p>Shanahan described an earlier private conversation during her remarks, saying she saw a "gold light" in Stanton King's eye while talking about “why you’re a pro-lifer."</p><p>"And I realized there was nothing you could say that I would disagree with because it was coming from your protection for the mothers and children in your community,” Shanahan said.</p><p>Stanton King runs a nonprofit in Georgia that supports women who chose not to get abortions and said she is advising the Kennedy campaign on abortion policy, according to multiple posts on her social media account.</p><p>Both Shanahan and Kennedy have issued <a href="https://twitter.com/NicoleShanahan/status/1777806901314793630" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>ambitious statements on abortion&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/NicoleShanahan/status/1777806901314793630&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee48c000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee48c000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>ambitious statements on abortion</u></a>, with Kennedy expressing support at times for <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/13/rfk-jr-backs-15-week-federal-ban-on-abortion-00111017" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>an abortion ban&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/13/rfk-jr-backs-15-week-federal-ban-on-abortion-00111017&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee48d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee48d0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>an abortion ban</u></a> and for abortion to be <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-stance-abortion-rcna151808" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>legal until \&quot;full term.\&quot;&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-stance-abortion-rcna151808&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee48d0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee48d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>legal until "full term."</u></a> The Kennedy campaign walked both statements back.</p><p>On criminal justice, the subject of the event, Shanahan mentioned donating money to the campaign of a progressive district attorney and learning about restorative justice.</p><p>“But then I realized it goes even deeper. I was learning how to heal myself. I was learning how to heal my daughter,” she said. “I was understanding what human health and spirit needs, and so I just realized what everybody needs is access to land, access to clean food, access to clean water, access to opportunity.”</p><p>Criminal justice reform is part of the stated mission of Shanahan's nonprofit, Bia Echo. It has distributed $11.6 million in grants for this purpose, according to financial disclosures filed to the IRS.</p><p>Volunteers also used the event to gather signatures to get Kennedy on the ballot in the Lone Star State before Monday’s ballot access deadline. The campaign needed to gather more than 100,000 signatures from registered voters who did not participate in either a Democratic or Republican primary. The campaign is expected to turn in more than the required amount, according to Richard Winger, whose Ballot Access News site tracks third-party ballot access.</p><p>Kennedy is poised to put forth the strongest third-party challenge in decades, thanks in part to his surname. Shanahan’s largest applause line didn't come from her talking about her own perspective or background, but instead when she mentioned Kennedy’s family legacy.</p><p>“Bobby Kennedy is finishing a story of what was robbed from his father and his uncle and that’s what this is all about,’ she said to applause. “His father and uncle were murdered for taking a stand. They were both shot in the head. They were silenced.”</p><p>“It’s not going to be easy,” she continued. “We’re up against so much shit right now.”</p><p><i>Peder Schaefer contributed to this reporting.</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Congress gave Biden a historic sum to green the economy, revive manufacturing and fix crumbling infrastructure. But most of it is unspent.</description>

The Biden campaign views Haley voters as a core part of its coalition this fall, especially as polls show some erosion among traditional Democratic groups such as young voters. Top campaign officials continue to court major Haley donors and possible anti-Trump GOP endorsers while honing their messages for bringing in Haley voters.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, has made no such moves to bring Haley voters back into the GOP tent. Two months after she dropped out of the primary, Trump has yet to contact Haley to ask for her support, according to a person familiar with their relationship, granted anonymity by POLITICO because they were not authorized to speak on the record.</p><p>“A lot of these voters will come home by November, but his future is in his hands,” said former Indiana GOP state Rep. Mike Murphy, who had been working to organize a fundraiser for Haley before she dropped out of the race. “If he fucks up more in court, gets convicted and makes an ass of himself like he continues to do, then these people are going to continue to be disgusted with him.”</p><p>As the now-settled presidential primary enters its final weeks, the anti-Trump protest vote is expected to keep rolling in. The Trump campaign has rebuffed the idea that a lingering opposition to Trump in the primaries will be a factor for him come November, but Biden’s campaign is betting it will play a sizable role.</p><p>The warning signs for Trump are striking because of the geography of where those voters live: suburbs, the place Trump warned in 2020 were under threat in a Biden presidency, are still getting bluer. The latest example came this week in barn-red Indiana’s primary, where Haley’s zombie campaign won 22 percent overall. The numbers were even higher in the suburban donut counties like Hamilton, the wealthy Indianapolis suburb of gated communities with manicured lawns, where Haley won 34 percent of the vote.</p><p>Similar patterns unfolded in key battleground states across the country. In Georgia’s primary, Haley won about 13 percent of the vote; she performed 10 points higher in suburban Cobb County, north of Atlanta. In crucial and swingy Arizona, Haley won 21 percent in Maricopa County, gaining more than 1 in five votes in the Phoenix suburbs. And in Wisconsin last month, Haley took as much as 17 percent of the vote in the counties surrounding Milwaukee.</p><p>“In every swing state, except for Nevada, the number of Nikki Haley [primary] voters far outpaces the [margin] between Trump and Biden in 2020,” said Robert Schwartz, executive director of the Haley Voters Working Group and an adviser to the Haley Voters for Biden super PAC. “In all those places, if you can get 20 percent to vote for Biden and another 5 to 10 percent who don’t vote at all, that’s going to be the difference-maker in this election.”</p><h2 style="text-align: left">Trump isn’t doing anything to court Haley and her supporters</h2><p>Haley is hosting dozens of top donors at a retreat Monday and Tuesday in Charleston, S.C., according to a spokesperson. She is not expected to endorse Trump or encourage donors to give to any other candidate during the event, which the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/nikki-haley-is-huddling-with-donors-and-wont-endorse-donald-trump-yet-052d3d0f" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;first reported&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/nikki-haley-is-huddling-with-donors-and-wont-endorse-donald-trump-yet-052d3d0f&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4950000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4950001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">first reported</a>.</p><p>Newly installed at the conservative Hudson Institute, Haley has focused her public criticism on Biden in recent weeks.

In Washington, Republicans say there are more appealing Senate races on which to focus their limited resources. And in Arizona, they are increasingly warning that Lake’s divisive persona and instinct for provocation could sabotage them yet again.</p><p>“When you don't really have a core belief in anything, and you're willing to take whatever position you think is politically expedient at the moment, you end up getting caught between a rock and a hard place before too long,” said former Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.), who ran against Lake in 2022.</p><p>Now, as Democrats have placed tens of millions of dollars in fall TV reservations, national Republicans haven’t begun to seriously invest in the state.

But Nichols, a Trump appointee, agreed to postpone the jail term while Bannon appealed the decision, agreeing that the complex mix of laws that govern executive privilege and testimonial immunity for White House aides could be overturned by higher courts.</p><p>But a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24657496-bannon" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;rejected Bannon’s argument&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24657496-bannon&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4a70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4a70001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">rejected Bannon’s argument</a>, saying the former aide and prominent podcaster had no legal rationale for his blanket refusal to appeal before the Jan. 6 committee — and that long-standing case law.</p><p>“Because we have no basis to depart from that binding precedent, and because none of Bannon’s other challenges to his convictions have merit, we affirm [the conviction],” the panel ruled in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24657496-bannon" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a 20-page opinion&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24657496-bannon&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4a70002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4a70003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a 20-page opinion</a>.</p><p>The judges on the panel included Barack Obama appointee Cornelia Pillard, Trump appointee Justin Walker and Joe Biden appointee Bradley Garcia.</p><p>Bannon’s lawyer, David Schoen, said the longtime Trump adviser intends to ask for a review by the full 11-member bench of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, known as an “en banc” review. If the court declines to take it up, Bannon may then petition the Supreme Court.</p><p>“Today’s decision is wrong as a matter of law and it reflects a very dangerous view of the threshold for criminal liability for any defendant in our country and for future political abuses of the congressional hearing process,” Schoen said.</p><p>Schoen noted that the appeals court has an opportunity to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/22/5-takeaways-steve-bannons-trial-00047555" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;overturn the 1950s-era precedent&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/22/5-takeaways-steve-bannons-trial-00047555&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4a70004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4a70005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">overturn the 1950s-era precedent</a> at the heart of the case against Bannon. That case, arising from an alleged mobster’s refusal to testify at a congressional hearing on organized crime, set a standard that a person who “willfully” refuses to appear when summoned by lawmakers can be punished by contempt, even if a lawyer advised them not to show up, or they intended to claim a privilege.</p><p>Friday’s decision comes after federal courts — including the Supreme Court — rejected a similar bid by former Trump White House aide Peter Navarro to stave off his own four-month sentence for defying the Jan. 6 committee. Navarro is currently serving his own four-month sentence in Miami.</p><p>Bannon and Navarro worked together on a strategy they dubbed the “Green Bay Sweep,” a plan to organize objections by members of Congress to electoral votes from states Biden won in 2020, delaying the process and buying time for GOP state legislatures to step in and appoint pro-Trump electors.</p><p>Both Bannon and Navarro refused to appear for depositions or provide documents to the Jan. 6 committee, even though the panel intended to inquire about a wide range of subjects that extended far beyond topics that might be covered by the confidentiality of their discussions with Trump while he was president. Though both claimed they were protected by immunity and executive privilege, the judges in their cases each rejected that argument, citing longstanding legal precedents that forbid “willful” defiance of a congressional subpoena no matter the excuse.</p>]]></content:encoded>

That would mean in-person speeches from the president, party luminaries and rising stars to draw television attention alongside a mix of pre-recorded testimonials and videos from other parts of the country.</p><p>The goal: drive maximum viewership on television and the internet while minimizing live programming and openings for protest in Chicago’s United Center. This would mean moving party business, such as rules and platform votes, off the floor and denying would-be demonstrators a chance to seize on contentious debates.</p><p>While the Biden campaign, White House and convention planners have only just started hatching plans, senior Democrats tell me they’re discussing whether to conduct such business before the convention even begins or move it out of the arena and across town to McCormick Place, their other Chicago venue. Serendipitously, Biden’s advisers may have a very good reason to move up such housekeeping: If the Ohio Legislature does not <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ohio-lawmakers-are-odds-effort-ensure-biden-appears-november-ballot-rcna151369" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715298450156,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018f-0b29-dff0-a7df-1f7ddaa10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715298450156,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018f-0b29-dff0-a7df-1f7ddaa10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ohio-lawmakers-are-odds-effort-ensure-biden-appears-november-ballot-rcna151369&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fc1-d37b-a3ff-7fdb2ca60001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;relax its ballot certification deadline&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fc1-d37b-a3ff-7fdb2ca50002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">relax its ballot certification deadline</a>, which is before the Democrats’ August convention, the DNC may have no choice but to technically nominate the president before the conclave begins.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351415987112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Also under consideration for Chicago: reviving the pre-taped delegation roll call from each state featured in 2020.</p><p>Not only were the clips memorable — who could forget the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-election-2020-oddities-9d8f36096c3b28f0e7f2052f0b190837" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715298475599,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018f-0b29-dff0-a7df-1f7ddaa10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715298475599,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018f-0b29-dff0-a7df-1f7ddaa10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-election-2020-oddities-9d8f36096c3b28f0e7f2052f0b190837&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fc1-d37b-a3ff-7fdb92c80001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Rhode Island chef&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fc1-d37b-a3ff-7fdb92c80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Rhode Island chef</a> standing on a state beach with a plate of calamari — but a video montage also means one less opportunity for hot mic spontaneity, and therefore disruption, from 50 states and territories worth of delegates.</p><p>“If there is one peep in that hall, the networks will be all over it,” a convention planner lamented.</p><p>The challenge, of course, is that the delegates attending and, more to the point, the donors financing the convention expect the rites of an in-person convention. The political convention industrial complex remains strong after centuries of tradition, no matter how much the operative class relished having total control over what was effectively a multi-day commercial four years ago.</p><p>So with campus protests over the war in Gaza raging and Biden being disrupted nearly everywhere he goes, Chicago’s organizers are plotting on how to preempt opportunities for heckling and quickly tamp down demonstrators who do get into the arena.</p><p>William M. Daley, the former Commerce secretary and son and brother of Chicago mayors, has urged top Biden officials to install a capable convention chair who knows how to wield a gavel and can restore order as needed, I’m told. One obvious possibility is Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and another is Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who before entering Congress was speaker of the California Assembly.</p><p>Convention planners are also considering a different chair for each night of the convention, to both share the burden and showcase as much of the party’s talent as possible.</p><p>For all the 1968 clips now being replayed of Chicago police clashing with protesters, it’s the prospect of disorder outside <i>and</i> inside the arena this summer that so alarms Democrats, because either display could hand Republicans fodder.</p><p>“The mayor owns the street but the party owns the inside,” Daley told me. “What happens inside the hall is reflective of our party.”</p><p>As Daley knows well, it wasn’t just the Grant Park images that conveyed chaos to the American voter. It was broadcasters Mike Wallace and Dan Rather being jostled at the convention, the latter of whom prompted Walter Cronkite on <a href="https://danratherjournalist.org/about-dan/controversies/punched-1968-dnc/video-1968-democratic-national-convention" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;live television&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://danratherjournalist.org/about-dan/controversies/punched-1968-dnc/video-1968-democratic-national-convention&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4ac0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4ac0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">live television</a> to denounce the floor managers as “a bunch of thugs.”</p><p>And while people are well aware of the video where then-Mayor Richard J. Daley mouths profanities at Abraham Ribicoff for accusing the police of using “Gestapo tactics in the streets of Chicago,” what’s less remembered is when the Wisconsin delegation used their turn in the roll call to propose suspending the convention and moving it elsewhere. Then-House Majority Leader Carl Albert struggled to keep control of the floor and was replaced as chair by up-and-coming Chicago lawmaker Dan Rostenkowski.</p><p>Democrats are quick to point out this is not 1968, when Americans were being drafted, or even 2016, when Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders’ bitter clash led to a summer convention that included thousands of unhappy Sanders delegates. The number of delegates who are attending as “uncommitted” — the write-in protest used by Democrats angry over Biden’s handling of Gaza — will only be in the dozens.</p><p>“They’re going to be so small in numbers, this is not like 2016 or even 2008, with the PUMAs,” said former DNC Chair Donna Brazile, alluding to the Hillary Clinton diehards who refused to back Barack Obama and created a vivid acronym for Party Unity My Ass.</p><p>What alarms some Democratic strategists is the evolution of this era’s protests. Protesters are savvier — they’ve managed to get inside dozens of events featuring the president and vice president — and their demonstrations also include some bad actors who are determined to provoke a reaction.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352186801112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>In anticipation of some protesters obtaining tickets, convention organizers said they’ll stage a war room and be prepared to drown them out with chants — “four more years” is always a standby — and block any banners with Biden-Harris signs.</p><p>That’s all how to manage the convention itself.</p><p>Just as complicated is how to handle the protesters beyond the walls of the United Center.</p><p>There’s already a joke going around Democratic strategist circles that the main difference between 2024 and 1968 is that the Chicago mayor this year will be on the side of the protesters, not the cops.</p><p>Forty-eight-year-old Brandon Johnson, who was elected mayor last year after incumbent Lori Lightfoot failed to even make the runoff, was an organizer with the Chicago Teachers Union and has yet to fully make the jump from activist to mayor of one of America’s largest cities.</p><p>It’s ironic because soon after he became mayor, he hosted DNC Chair Jaime Harrison for lunch and, according to a Democrat familiar with the conversation, immediately pronounced that “nobody else represents the city but me.” He also asked if Harrison would have his back as a fellow Black man (Harrison, I’m told, tried to delicately explain that the convention would be a partnership between the party, the city and the state of Illinois).<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/32/75/010df1ef4626bc46c337b7ca217d/election-2024-democratic-convention-safety-05650.jpg" /><br /><p>“If there’s any mayor that understands the value of protest and demonstration, it’s me,” Johnson told reporters earlier this week at a groundbreaking, dismissing a question about Sen. Dick Durbin’s (D-Ill.) concerns over unrest in the city during the convention. Johnson said, “Without protests and real demands of a government, people of color and women do not have a place in society.”</p><p>More striking was how Johnson responded to whether he thought it was appropriate for police to have been dispatched last weekend to a protest at one of Chicago’s art museums. He spoke in a detached manner — the museum “made that request and the police department reacted,” the mayor said — evading the question and leaving the impression he somehow wasn’t in charge of the city and its police department.</p><p>Johnson praised the importance of protecting free speech and initially said that was paramount to safety, which he called “second most important,” before seeming to recognize his error.</p><p>When I asked him what his vision of a successful Democratic convention looked like, Johnson repeated the same formulation — “safe, vibrant and energetic” — before saying he wanted young people to “see what democracy really looks like.”</p><p>At no point did he mention Joe Biden or the importance of the convention in helping the president’s reelection.</p><p>It was an eye-opening exchange. And it made clear why so many Democrats, in Chicago and beyond, respond to questions about Johnson with a sigh and hope that he’ll recognize the weight of this moment, both for his career, the city and the country.</p><p>Exacerbating matters, Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who lobbied the White House relentlessly for the convention, have a strained relationship. They’ve disagreed on issues from immigration to a new, subsidized stadium for the Chicago Bears.</p><p>When I first saw the governor and mayor earlier in the week, it was at the Field Museum for an unveiling of an exhibit on a newly discovered bird fossil. As the two sat in the front row before the event got underway, just a single seat separating them, they looked straight ahead in silence and did not speak to one another in the way politicians of the same party almost always do in such moments.</p><p>With the demise of longtime Illinois Democratic boss (and state house speaker) Michael Madigan, though, there’s no semblance of a political machine here. What’s left is Pritzker, a billionaire who’s won two terms and can bankroll the party, and a handful of public employee unions, most notably the teachers from which Johnson emerged.</p><p>The best Democrats could say about the Johnson-Pritzker dynamic was that, well, at least it’s not as bad as the Andrew Cuomo-Bill de Blasio relationship in New York.</p><p>“It's an event that’s critical to the Democratic Party, so we’re all going to work together to make it a success,” Cook County President Toni Preckwinkle, a veteran of Chicago’s political wars, told me when I asked about the mayor and the governor.</p><p>Preckwinkle was far less enthused about a disruptive cacophony of free expression in the city. While noting she was “old enough to have been in a lot of anti-war marches,” she said that although people are free to protest, “the challenge, of course, is when people decide that expressing their opinion involves impeding other people’s ability to go to work, or go to school or acts of vandalism.”</p><p>Senior Democrats made clear they’ll mostly lean on Pritzker and his canny chief of staff, Anne Caprara, this summer.</p><p>The governor already prevailed in a proxy war with the mayor over who would run the host committee. Pritzker installed another of his lieutenants to oversee the local organization that helps put on the conclave along with the convention directors, national party and Biden campaign. Johnson was, though, able to make a member of his inner circle a senior adviser to the host committee as part of an agreement to keep peace between the mayor and governor.</p><p>It’s a détente Pritzker is eager to sustain, at least through August.</p><p>Asked at the groundbreaking this week if he was open to calling in the National Guard for the convention, the governor said he didn’t think “we’ll need it.” But Pritzker made sure to note the Chicago police had jurisdiction and he’d only call in the guard if “the city asks us to — it would be completely inappropriate to just march into a city.”<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

Kathy Hochul said she regrets her remark that Black children in the Bronx don’t know the word “computer.” Black Lives Matter and education activists from the borough say that’s not enough.</p><p>“Our governor does not know the true capabilities of the children of the Bronx,” Hawk Newsome, co-founder of Black Lives Matter of Greater New York, said on Friday. “These are great, special children who will grow up to be world-changing adults — if only New York State government would do their part.”</p><p>Newsome and his sister Chivona joined Black students at a south Bronx charter school to condemn Hochul’s perpetuation of a negative stereotype.</p><p>The Democratic governor <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hochul-black-kids-bronx-computer-comment-e0c3c69b1ebf9639d8f9e402096f8446" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;had said offhandedly Monday&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apnews.com/article/hochul-black-kids-bronx-computer-comment-e0c3c69b1ebf9639d8f9e402096f8446&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4b70004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4b70005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">had said offhandedly Monday</a> from the stage of the Milken Institute Global Conference, “Right now, we have young Black kids growing up in the Bronx who don’t even know what the word computer is.”</p><p>She apologized later that day, then added Thursday to reporters, “I chose the wrong words. I know I hurt a lot of people. I took full responsibility for it. I said that before, I said that the first day and I’ll continue to say it.”</p><p>The coalition of Black activists who gathered Friday said not having equitable access to computers does not equate to not knowing what a computer is. They showcased young people who are capable and college-bound, one of whom said he was so shocked at Hochul’s remark that he believed the video to be AI.</p><p>The Newsomes and their allies demanded the governor help make the Bronx “a tech hub” by investing in technology infrastructure, expanding partnerships between colleges and government tech officials and appointing a Black “tech czar” for the borough.</p><p>A Hochul spokesperson pointed POLITICO to her announcement last month of a $50 million Digital Equity Plan, including in partnership with several Bronx groups; her recent budget’s allocation of $13.6 billion overall for the city’s public schools; and legislation creating the state’s first commission to study reparations.</p><p>Hochul’s sentiment on Black children in the Bronx and computers initially drew scorn from Assemblymember Amanda Septimo, a Bronx Democrat, who called it “harmful, deeply misinformed, and genuinely appalling” and invited the governor to meet with children in the borough.</p><p>But the governor received backing from two prominent Black leaders: Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie of the Bronx and New York City <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/05/07/mayor-adams-gives-gov-hochul-pass-on-remarks-about-bronx-black-kids-not-knowing-what-computer-is/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Mayor Eric Adams&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/05/07/mayor-adams-gives-gov-hochul-pass-on-remarks-about-bronx-black-kids-not-knowing-what-computer-is/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4b70006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4b70007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Mayor Eric Adams</a>.</p><p>“I am not the word police; I know the governor’s heart,” Adams told reporters Tuesday. “The people of the Bronx knew where her heart was.

He made the comments pushing back on his critics in response to a question about working in a world that seems meanspirited.</p><p>“I think there’s challenges to that. We’re in a world and we — certainly my wife and I the last two or three years it’s been — just the nastiness and the lies, it’s just incredible,” Thomas said.</p><p>“But you have some choices. You don’t get to prevent people from doing horrible things or saying horrible things. But one you have to understand and accept the fact that they can’t change you unless you permit that,” Thomas said.</p><p>Thomas has faced criticisms that he accepted luxury trips from a GOP donor without reporting them. Thomas last year maintained that he didn’t have to report the trips paid for by one of “our dearest friends.” His wife, conservative activist Ginni Thomas has faced criticism for using her Facebook page to amplify unsubstantiated claims of corruption by President Joe Biden, a Democrat.</p><p>He did not discuss the content of the criticisms directly, but said that “reckless” people in Washington will “bomb your reputation.”</p><p>“They don’t bomb you necessarily, but they bomb your reputation or your good name or your honor. And that’s not a crime. But they can do as much harm that way,” Thomas said.</p><p>During the appearance, Thomas was asked questions by U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, one of Thomas’ former law clerks who was later appointed to the federal bench. During his hour-long appearance, the longest-serving justice on the court discussed a wide range of topics including the lessons of his grandfather, his friendship with former colleagues and his belief that court writings and discussions should be more accessible for “regular people.”</p><p>Thomas, who spent most of his working life in Washington, D.C., also discussed his dislike of it.</p><p>“I think what you are going to find and especially in Washington, people pride themselves on being awful. It is a hideous place as far as I’m concerned,” Thomas said. Thomas said that it is one of the reasons he and his wife “like RVing.”</p><p>“You get to be around regular people who don’t pride themselves in doing harmful things, merely because they have the capacity to do it or because they disagree,” Thomas said.</p><p>A recreational vehicle used by Thomas also became a source of controversy. Senate Democrats in October issued a report saying that most of the $267,000 loan obtained by Thomas to buy a high-end motorcoach appears to have been forgiven.</p><p>Thomas did not discuss the court’s high-profile caseload.</p><p>The justice said he believed it is important to use language in court rulings so that the law is accessible to the average person.</p><p>“The regular people I think are being disenfranchised sometimes by the way that we talk about cases,” Thomas said.</p><p>Thomas wasn’t the only justice making a speaking appearance Friday.</p><p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh said Friday that U.S. history shows court decisions unpopular in their time later can become part of the “fabric of American constitutional law.”</p><p>Kavanaugh spoke Friday at a conference attended by judges, attorneys and other court personnel in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi and is one of the most conservative circuits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

(AP) — An unusually strong solar storm hitting Earth produced stunning displays of color in the skies across the Northern Hemisphere early Saturday, with no immediate reports of disruptions to power and communications.</p><p>The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a rare severe geomagnetic storm warning when a solar outburst reached Earth on Friday afternoon, hours sooner than anticipated. The effects of the Northern Lights, which were prominently on display in Britain, were due to last through the weekend and possibly into next week.</p><p>Many in the U.K. shared phone snaps of the lights on social media early Saturday, with the phenomenon seen as far south as London and southern England.</p><p>There were sightings “from top to tail across the country,” said Chris Snell, a meteorologist at the Met Office, Britain’s weather agency. He added that the office received photos and information from other European locations including Prague and Barcelona.</p><p>NOAA alerted operators of power plants and spacecraft in orbit, as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to take precautions.</p><p>“For most people here on planet Earth, they won’t have to do anything,” said Rob Steenburgh, a scientist with NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center.</p><p>The storm could produce northern lights as far south in the U.S. as Alabama and Northern California, NOAA said. But it was hard to predict and experts stressed it would not be the dramatic curtains of color normally associated with the northern lights, but more like splashes of greenish hues.</p><p>“That’s really the gift from space weather: the aurora,” Steenburgh said. He and his colleagues said the best aurora views may come from phone cameras, which are better at capturing light than the naked eye.</p><p>Snap a picture of the sky and “there might be actually a nice little treat there for you,” said Mike Bettwy, operations chief for the prediction center.</p><p>The most intense solar storm in recorded history, in 1859, prompted auroras in central America and possibly even Hawaii. “We are not anticipating that” but it could come close, NOAA space weather forecaster Shawn Dahl said.</p><p>This storm poses a risk for high-voltage transmission lines for power grids, not the electrical lines ordinarily found in people’s homes, Dahl told reporters. Satellites also could be affected, which in turn could disrupt navigation and communication services here on Earth.</p><p>An extreme geomagnetic storm in 2003, for example, took out power in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa.</p><p>Even when the storm is over, signals between GPS satellites and ground receivers could be scrambled or lost, according to NOAA. But there are so many navigation satellites that any outages should not last long, Steenburgh noted.</p><p>The sun has produced strong solar flares since Wednesday, resulting in at least seven outbursts of plasma. Each eruption, known as a coronal mass ejection, can contain billions of tons of plasma and magnetic field from the sun’s outer atmosphere, or corona.</p><p>The flares seem to be associated with a sunspot that’s 16 times the diameter of Earth, NOAA said. It is all part of the solar activity ramping up as the sun approaches the peak of its 11-year cycle.</p><p>NASA said the storm posed no serious threat to the seven astronauts aboard the International Space Station. The biggest concern is the increased radiation levels, and the crew could move to a better shielded part of the station if necessary, according to Steenburgh.</p><p>Increased radiation also could threaten some of NASA’s science satellites. Extremely sensitive instruments will be turned off, if necessary, to avoid damage, said Antti Pulkkinen, director of the space agency’s heliophysics science division.</p><p>Several sun-focused spacecraft are monitoring all the action.</p><p>“This is exactly the kinds of things we want to observe,” Pulkkinen said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

You are able to really be a part of the society.”</p><p>Day one of Adams’ Roman holiday has been far from restful as he toured a subway tunnel under construction near the Colosseum and a slaughterhouse that was converted into an arthouse and sat with a roundtable of Nobel Peace Prize laureates.

Abroad in Rome, he said his multi-day trip will include tours of migrant housing.</p><p>“I would love to see how they are housing them, what services they are provided,” Adams said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lawmakers sent the national security supplemental, which also included support for the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific region, to President Joe Biden’s desk last month.</p><p>The National Security Council didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The information on Friday's package was according to two U.S. officials, a person familiar and a notification sent to Congress obtained by POLITICO. The people were granted anonymity to speak ahead of the official announcement.</p><p>The Biden administration had assessed that Ukraine could at most hold its lines without American aid, but could claw back some seized territory from Russia once it received the U.S.-provided weapons.</p><p>Ukraine faces yet another brutal test as Russia on Friday launched a ground attack in the northeastern Kharkiv region. “Russia has begun a new wave of counteroffensive actions in this direction,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters Friday. “Ukraine has met them there with our troops, brigades and artillery.”</p><p>The Ukrainian Defense Ministry announced it is swiftly sending reserve units to the region to help repel the attack.</p><p>In March, Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to create a “sanitary zone” that would help protect his forces against long-range Ukrainian attacks that occasionally strike targets inside sovereign Russian territory. Russian military bloggers suggested the Kharkiv offensive was part of that long-promised effort.</p><p>The U.S. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/24/us-long-range-missiles-ukraine-00154110" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715352417548,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000166-f45d-dc66-ad6e-f45d16b90016&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715352417548,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000166-f45d-dc66-ad6e-f45d16b90016&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/24/us-long-range-missiles-ukraine-00154110&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-62f8-d3a0-a5df-63fba7770001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;secretly sent a significant number of long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems to Ukraine&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-62f8-d3a0-a5df-63fba7770000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">secretly sent a significant number of long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems to Ukraine</a> in April, with Kyiv using the weapon at least twice before the transfer became public.

Ukraine has 20 of the systems, which can launch long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems and other precision munitions, but has lost several to Russian fire in recent months.</p><p>Adm. Antony Radakin, U.K.’s chief of the Defense Staff, told reporters in Washington on Thursday that by June, Russia will have lost 500,000 troops killed or wounded in Ukraine, and that despite losing some territory this year, Kyiv retains “the strategic upper hand” now that more military aid is flowing from the U.S. and allies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The voice was close to SNL-worthy.</p><p>“Mike is straight out of central casting,” fake Trump said.</p><p>This is true. Johnson, a former high school thespian, is boyish and nerdy and exudes a southern sweetness that even his most vociferous critics don’t deny.</p><p>“He’s a good speaker of the House,” he continued.</p> <p>That would have been highly debatable not long ago, but Johnson is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/08/mike-johnson-house-speaker-congress-00156764" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;enjoying a period of renewed respect&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/08/mike-johnson-house-speaker-congress-00156764&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4c80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4c80001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">enjoying a period of renewed respect</a>, particularly after avoiding a shutdown and pushing through aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Most House Republicans are now more frustrated with far-right members who make Johnson’s life difficult than they are with Johnson. Democrats rewarded him for his streak of responsible governing by saving him from a motion to vacate.</p><p>“I’ve liked him!” Johnson-as-Trump boasted.</p><p>Also true. Johnson seems to have picked the lock of Trump relationship management, getting the former president to stand down on the aid package and the motion to vacate.</p><p>So if that Trump impersonation makes it sound like the speaker is in a good mood, it’s because he is.</p><p>A few hours after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s attempt to oust him was easily defeated, Johnson sat down for an interview with the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Deep Dive podcast&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4c80002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4c80003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Deep Dive podcast</a> in the speaker’s suite, where he sat under a painting of his idol Ronald Reagan and answered questions for over an hour.<br /></p><br /><p>Johnson said he would not try to defund the office of special counsel Jack Smith, as sought by Greene.</p><p>The longtime social conservative said he wouldn’t try to pass a nationwide abortion ban if Republicans won full control of Washington in November, citing Trump’s call to let states decide the matter.</p><p>He also talked about Israel, January 6, the future of conservatism and his relationships with key Washington leaders, such as Joe Biden (his age “concerns me deeply”), Hakeem Jeffries (“a good family man”), Kevin McCarthy (“I have a lot of sympathy for” him), and, of course, Donald Trump, who, Johnson noted, has never heard his impersonation but thinks he would like it.</p><p>“Imitation,” he said, “is the greatest form of flattery.”</p><p><i>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity with help from Deep Dive senior producer Alex Keeney.</i><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/41/22/33f4e43240e5831170641ada3f65/u-s-congress-18782.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Lizza: So let's start with the motion to vacate. That resolution said that you aided and abetted Democrats in destroying our country, and 11 Republicans agreed with that and voted not to table it. Which of the 11 Republicans surprised you the most?</b></p><p>I haven't even studied the list. I haven't had time after the vote on the floor.</p><p><b>Lizza: You want to hear it? Biggs. Burlison. Crane. Davidson. Gosar. Greene. Massie. Mooney. Moore of Alabama. Roy and Spartz.&#xa0;</b></p><p>Hmm, I'd say several of those surprise me.</p><p>Look, those are all friends and colleagues I’ve worked with for a long time. I would not read too much into the voting against the motion to table. In fact, a couple of those folks told me privately that they would never have voted to vacate, and they wished it hadn't happened; but for some reason, they felt like it was important not to go on record against, or to be in favor of the motion to table.</p><p>I don't quite understand the rationale there, but I'll take them at their word. Look, we have a job to do here. We have to govern. I'm glad that that was done. Let's rip the Band-Aid off and get it done. I regret that it had to come to that. I spent a lot of time over the last couple days talking with Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene and even Paul Gosar about it. It's the way I operate. It's the way I've been leading since I got the job.</p><p>I take thoughts, suggestions, ideas from members all the time, almost on an hourly basis. And when they're constructive ideas, we try to implement them. That's how you do this job, especially when you have the smallest majority in U.S. history and a one-vote margin. You need every member on the team to feel like they're contributing and feel like they have a say in it. And so it's a gigantic part of every day here. That's what I was doing with them, and I didn't think they would go through with it.</p><p>But you know what? I went up and talked to all three of the ones who brought the motion, Thomas and Marjorie too before we left the chamber. They were some of the last to leave. And, I said, “You know what? I don't carry grudges, and I'm not angry about this. We have to work together. And I want to work with you guys and those ideas we were talking about. I'm still working on them, so I hope we can put this behind us and move forward.”</p><p><b>Bade: Did they say why they chose to do this [on Wednesday] after saying they'd give you some time to answer their requests?&#xa0;</b></p><p>They didn't have an answer for that. I think I probably surprised them by my approach and demeanor on it. But who knows? I can't get in the mind of anybody else. What I do know is that we have an important job to do here.</p><p>These are perilous times for the country. There are hot wars around the globe. We have allies in jeopardy, our border’s wide open. The cost of living is through the roof. The crime rate’s through the roof. We’ve got antisemitism and angry mobs on college campuses. This is no time for frivolous, palace intrigue and politics.</p><p>We have got to have a functioning Congress, and I think the landslide vote against removing the speaker is a signal that I think people on both sides of the aisle obviously understand this is not a time for games.</p><p><b>Lizza: Having said that, I think people are curious for you to just take us inside these negotiations that you had this week with Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene. Rachael reported that there were at least three demands: the “Hastert Rule,” no more aid to Ukraine and defunding Jack Smith's special counsel office. Are those on the table for you?</b></p><p>Well, first of all, there weren't negotiations. I did to Thomas and Marjorie exactly what I do with all members of the conference. As I said, people come in all the time with ideas and we process them. I don't make snap judgments.</p><p>On the Hastert Rule, as it's called, there are a couple of instances where there wasn't the majority of Republicans [voting for a bill on the floor]. One was in the appropriations process. But as I explained to the two of them in my office, we did have a whip count that did have a majority of Republicans. Eight people flipped at the last minute. And that's not something the speaker can control. We didn't break the rule. I've been following the Hastert Rule since the day I got the gavel.</p><p>The Ukraine vote got slightly fewer Republicans that voted for it, but that vote wasn't whipped. And so the Hastert Rule has never been violated so long as I've been involved. And I have no intention of doing so. So agreeing to that wasn't a negotiation. I just affirmed, yeah, I'm already committed to that.</p><p>With regard to Ukraine funding, I don't expect that there's any further request for funding before the end of this year. That was their demand. And I said, I'm already working under that assumption. So you're not asking me to do anything that I haven't already thought and resolved to do.</p><p>And then with regard to defunding Jack Smith, look, I think that there's been a terrible dereliction of duty with regard to the special counsel and how the whole system has been abused, and how they've engaged in lawfare against President Trump. All of these things are, to me, self-evident truths.</p><p>But that's not something you wave a wand and just eliminate the special counsel as a provision. It's been part of the law, you know, the tradition and the law for 25 years. Before that, it was the independent counsel. And I explained to both of them, as a former constitutional law attorney and litigator myself, that there is a necessity for a function like that, because sometimes the Department of Justice, which is an executive branch agency, can't necessarily, without a conflict of interest, investigate or prosecute the president who's their boss or the president's family. So you have to have some functioning equivalent of that.</p><p><b>Bade: So are you prepared then to stick this into appropriations bills to defund the special counsel?&#xa0;</b></p><p>No.</p><p>We were in the very beginning stages of even beginning to investigate what that would look like. I do think there has to be accountability. Congress has the power of the purse, of course. And we have oversight responsibility. And we've been vigorously using both of those powers. I think we need to look very closely at how we address what I regard to be special counsels that are outside the bounds of what they're intended and supposed to do. But no decisions were made about any of that yet.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/f6/ba/5580b97e4c98bb2c999171391b9a/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2148449338" /><br /><p><b>Lizza: On the motion to vacate, I want to ask you about the role of former President Trump. He came out full-throated against it, but he also said at some point he may favor a motion to vacate. So, a couple of questions. One is how did you neutralize Trump on this issue? And do you worry about that latter part of the statement that sounds a bit like a threat?</b></p><p>No, I don't take it as a threat. I was with President Trump this past weekend at Mar-a-Lago, and he invited me up on the stage. I was the only other person besides him who spoke, when there were potential vice presidential picks on the stage.</p><p>He's been very supportive. I know him very well. We’ve worked together for almost eight years now. We came to Washington at the same time, and we worked together very well over that period. I have always been very forthright with him and very honest, and told him what I thought was in his best interest, in the country's best interest, even if sometimes he didn't necessarily agree. But on reflection, he often says, “Mike is a really good guy. He's doing a really hard job.”</p><p>I think we have a very good relationship of trust. And he knows that when I advise him of something or give him an idea or tell him something I have to do, I think he appreciates that I'm operating in good faith. And that means a lot to President Trump.</p><p>I believe he's going to be elected president again. And I think if I'm serving as speaker and I intend to be, I think he and I having a close relationship will be very important for the country because we have a lot of problems to fix.</p><p><b>Bade: Some Republicans say that you are only speaker right now because of him. Do you agree?</b></p><p>Well, I don't know. He did throw in an endorsement of me when the speaker's race was ongoing. We all remember well, we closed Congress for three weeks because we didn't have a speaker.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/55/07/2561db7444a9b0dc14a207b3ec58/house-of-representatives-63249.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Lizza: It’s all a blur?</b></p><p>Yes, it's all a blur to me. The entire last six months is a blur to me in some way.</p><p>But this is an important thing to say: I never aspired to be speaker of the House. This was not on my bucket list. I was quite content to be a lieutenant. I was on the leadership team, and I worked against the motion to vacate for Kevin McCarthy. I then worked to get Steve Scalise elected speaker, and Jim Jordan and the more senior guys who are very close friends of mine. And it didn't happen.</p><p>I was sitting in the back of the room as that played out. I had a sense that I could get 217 votes, but I didn't jump forward and put myself out there as a candidate because that's not my way.</p><p>Somebody told me — I had a mentor when I was in eighth grade — and they said, “Mike, always remember this: Real leadership is recognized and not imposed.” And I've thought about that a lot over my life, and I'm not the type of person who puts myself out there and says, “I'm going to be the leader.” To me, you let other people recognize it and call you forward. And that's ultimately what happened.</p><p><b>Lizza: The fact that you mentioned a mentor just reminded me of something. Rep. Chip Roy was your mentor when you were a freshman.&#xa0;</b></p><p>Actually, it was the opposite. I was his mentor. I did an exceptional job with that, didn’t I?</p><p><b>Lizza: So does that one sting? Is there a particular sting from his criticism, given the history of that relationship?&#xa0;</b></p><p>It doesn't. Look, I regard Chip as a friend. He’s an interesting character.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/1b/9c/d68a360a4e92905f5643fdf5a4ab/u-s-congress-67015.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Lizza: You’re very forgiving.</b></p><p>Well, that's my worldview. I'm a Bible-believing Christian. That's one of the first commands we have. You're supposed to love your enemies. Nobody in this building is my enemy. We have political opposition and people on the other side of the aisle and even sometimes people in our own camp, but they're not enemies. They're all colleagues and friends. I regard them all as such. You know, the Bible's very clear. You're supposed to bless even those who persecute you. I'm getting a lot of practice in that right now. But there's lots of biblical admonitions that apply here. “A soft word turns away wrath.”</p><p>You get a lot further in a legislative body when you can build relationships with people and work on building trust among colleagues. And that's what I do. That's just the way I live. And so I'm not angry at anybody about it. Chip's still going to be my friend.</p><p><b>Lizza: President Biden told CNN that if Israel invades Rafah, the U.S. will stop supplying it with artillery shells and other offensive weapons. His quote was, “If they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons.” Very, very clear. What's your view of that?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I was informed about that about 10 minutes before I walked in this room. And my reaction honestly, was, “Wow.” That is a complete turn from what I have been told, even in recent hours. I mean, 24 hours ago, it was confirmed to me by top administration officials that the policy's very different than what he stated there. So I hope that's a senior moment.</p><p><b>Lizza: Wait, can you just explain that?</b></p><p>I was in the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/what-scif-who-uses-it-n743991" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;SCIF having classified discussions&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/what-scif-who-uses-it-n743991&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4c90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4c90001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">SCIF having classified discussions</a> with some top administration officials. The subject matter of my concern, I can tell you, was we got word about <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/us-concerns-over-israels-gaza-policy-led-to-weapons-holdup-00156528" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the shipment of munitions being delayed&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/us-concerns-over-israels-gaza-policy-led-to-weapons-holdup-00156528&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4c90002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4c90003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the shipment of munitions being delayed</a>. And that was a great concern to us because I got commitments from top administration officials before we passed the supplemental package for the aid to Israel that that would not happen. And there would be no delay whatsoever. They repeat it to me in writing and verbally, no delay in the delivery of weapons to Israel because it's so desperately needed.</p><p>So yesterday I talked with Prime Minister Netanyahu about it, and I wanted to get confirmation from him exactly what's happening. And he described exactly what was happening — before the news was confirmed.</p><p><b>Lizza: Before Biden’s statement?</b></p><p>Well, this is well before the statement. We were just hearing rumors [about the delayed munitions]. So I confirmed it with Prime Minister Netanyahu. And then I went straight to the White House and I said, ”What gives? Somebody's going to have to explain this to me because it's very different than what I was told.”</p><p>And they said, “Oh, this has nothing to do with the supplemental package that you all passed. This is the earlier weapons tranches.” “Well, Israel needs it right now.” “Well we're working on that.” “Well you better work on it quickly.”</p><p>So this statement by the president, I hope — I believe he's off script. I don't think that's something that staff told him to say. I hope it's a senior moment because that would be a great deviation in what is said to be the policy there and in the very critical relationship we have with Israel.</p><p><b>Lizza: Do you feel betrayed by this then?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I got to say that I do. We've been very deliberate. We've been very open, very much in good faith. The Congress expressed its will through that vote. And so for the administration to make such a huge deviation in policy without any consultation with us and in defiance of what we quite literally just voted on here, days ago. To me, it raises a lot of alarm.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/6a/73/4058cdff445688d2aeadb8bb169a/u-s-congress-57021.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Bade: A lot of your Republican colleagues say that they find Biden to be senile. You've talked a lot with him through these negotiations. Do you agree with that?</b></p><p>I don't know if I'm in any position to diagnose his mental acuity. But look, I will say, it's not personal, but everyone ages differently. It's physiology or what have you. Everybody's different. My father-in-law is the same age as Joe Biden, and he acts as though he's 20 years younger. He's vibrant, he works long days, he still runs his business that he's been running for many years. He's on his A-game.</p><p>To be candid, I don't believe President Biden is. And it concerns me deeply. I take no pleasure in saying that because I think it's a dangerous thing for the country. I think that our adversaries see him in the same way that many Americans do. And I think that's a very dangerous thing for us right now, because that's why our adversaries are acting so provocatively. I believe in Reagan's principles. He reminded us that we maintain peace through strength. And if America doesn't project strength, it's a great concern to free people around the world. And you see the results.</p><p><b>Bade: What gives you the impression that Biden has lost a step a little bit with age?</b></p><p>You know, I don't want to violate any personal confidences or anything, but I've had private conversations with him, of course. But you don't need to rely upon my reflection of a private conversation. You can see him in public, in his public statements. And it's important.</p><p><b>Lizza: One more thing about President Biden. </b><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/biden-federal-funds-spending-tracking" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;b>POLITICO reported in a very important investigation&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/biden-federal-funds-spending-tracking&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4c90004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4c90005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>POLITICO reported in a very important investigation</b></a><b> that billions of dollars from Biden's four big 2021 and 2022 legislative packages remain unspent. Have you thought about clawing back that unspent money from those four bills, and what you might spend it on?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Well, the principle of clawing back unspent dollars is an easy yes. But of course the devil's in the details. I'm not sure what categories those are, what accounts they're in, what it was dedicated for. If we have the ability to claw it back, we could certainly use that money.</p><p>Right now, we've got $35.5 trillion in federal debt. And we're working every day on restoring the principles of fiscal sanity here. One of the things we're trying to do, for example, is break up the governance by omnibus. We got a first stab at it. We broke the last spending package into two minibuses. And now we're going to actually endeavor to do 12 separate appropriations bills for fiscal year 2025.</p><p><b>Bade: How are you going to do that when a bunch of your members are sinking rules left and right? You weren't able to do all 12 bills last time. What makes you think you can this year?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Well, the reason I'm such an optimist about this is because I handle this situation and this challenge like every other. We're going to set up listening sessions when we get back next week to have everybody come in. We'll begin with the topline spending numbers, build consensus on that.</p><p>We're going to do something that's also innovative: We're going to start with an actual number that everybody can agree to on the front end, not waste time negotiating that. Then the appropriators can begin their process, methodically taking each of the bills, working that through the committee process.</p><p>I met with <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/20/grow-up-a-veteran-republican-is-tired-of-his-partys-insurgents-00153454" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Tom Cole&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/20/grow-up-a-veteran-republican-is-tired-of-his-partys-insurgents-00153454&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4c90006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4c90007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Tom Cole</a>, who's our Appropriations chair, and he says, “We can do that.” We can produce those bills by the end of the summer and get them ready for movement on the floor. We'd like to do that and get it through the House and send it over to the Senate, and then dare Chuck Schumer not to do his job. I think that that would be fun for the House to jam the Senate for a change.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Bade: Tom Cole said that you were going to mark up the bills at the levels that have already been negotiated with Democrats, not try to do this thing that McCarthy did, where you cut like $100 billion or some such. Again, you think conservatives are going to vote for appropriations bills at that level?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Well, I can tell you, I've talked to a number of House Freedom Caucus members, Chip Roy and others, and many of them have already said it’s the number that was already negotiated. I think it's $1.606 or $1.621 trillion.</p><p>But there is a number that everyone has already agreed to. The thing that people rejected last time was the so-called “side deals” and “gimmicks” and all the other stuff on the outside.</p><p><b>Lizza: We want to ask you about some of your fellow leaders in Congress. Let's start with Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader. Like you, he's a religious man. Have you gotten to know Jeffries as a brother in Christ?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I have. Hakeem is a good man. We’ve worked well together. We have a lot more in common than people might think. You know, he's from New York and I'm from Louisiana. While we have lots of disagreements on policies and the fine points of policy, I think you can appreciate people for who they are as a person. I think that's what we're called to do. And he and I both kind of share the worldview on that. I can appreciate that he's a good family man. We have a lot in common in that regard. And he lost his father recently, I lost mine three days before I got elected to Congress. We've talked about that.</p><p>We've talked about how he and I both came to our leadership positions in a rather circuitous fashion that neither of us predicted or expected, in terms of timing and how we would be elevated as we were. He's been here a little bit longer than I have been. But, there are things that we have in common.</p><p>And I think what we've appreciated about one another is that I believe that when Hakeem Jeffries is telling me something, I believe he's telling me the truth. I believe he is a man of his word. And I think he believes that about me as well. That's a big thing in Washington. You know, trust is a rare commodity around here.</p><p>While we don't agree on many things, it's really refreshing to sit across the table from someone who is your political adversary and know that they're shooting straight. I wish that we could have a lot more of that around here because it would solve a lot of problems. Look, I'm a Reagan Republican. I love the way he did the job. He was a happy warrior, you know?</p><p>He was a hero to all of us. I think to all Republicans, he's still the standard-bearer. And the reason is because of the way he did the job. He's very principled. But he didn't hate anybody, right?</p><p>Reagan and [Democratic Speaker] Tip O'Neill famously had this great relationship. And after his assassination attempt, Tip O'Neill goes to the hospital and kisses him on the forehead. They didn't agree on almost anything, but they had respect for one another. And I think we’ve got to get back to that. I think America needs more of that.</p><p>The person on the other side of the aisle is not an enemy. They're a fellow American. Our enemies are like Hamas and Hezbollah and the people who are trying to kill us. These are our political adversaries. The Founders anticipated that you have people with very different philosophical ideas, very different principles and ideas about government, but we would come here, sit around a table and arm wrestle together and kind of get to a point of consensus so that we can govern the country. This system doesn't work unless you understand the principles that undergird it. And I think restoring those principles is really important for this institution to endure.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/bc/7e/3c0e7eed4866be32b9cfe6b4694c/house-of-representatives-61396.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Bade: You talk about Republicans you admire. Let's talk about a more controversial Republican leader: Kevin McCarthy. When you were elected speaker, did he ever call you and offer any advice? Did you ever seek his counsel?&#xa0;</b></p><p>He did early on. Look, I was on the leadership team under Speaker McCarthy. I was the vice chairman of the House Republican Conference. It’s the No. 6 leadership position. It was funny because when I became speaker, it was like “Who is this mysterious man?” I was like, “I've been on leadership for three years. You guys didn't know what the vice chairman of the Republican conference is? Come on.”</p><p>It was meaningless, but I was on the team. I was at the table, and I was trying to help advance the agenda. And, you know, Kevin was good to me. It was a very painful thing that happened to him. I mean, it was an unprecedented thing. Vacating the chair was devastating to all of us, and it was like being part of a traumatic experience that lasted and endured for too long.</p><p>There was a lot of pain for him personally, I'm sure, that came out of that. But in spite of that, I spoke at his farewell party that they threw for him, this big gathering a couple weeks later. He reached out multiple times in the beginning to offer assistance and try to help. To his credit, you know, that was a tough thing. It's a tough thing. And he knew that I had no ulterior motive. I was never involved in trying to remove him or anything. I think we still have that mutual respect.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/e1/94/89e160fa4df9904170cfb26ebd28/mag-lizza-deepdive-johnson-015.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Bade: Where do you think McCarthy went wrong as speaker? And what are you doing to make sure you don't fall into those traps?&#xa0;</b></p><p>It's not my place to judge my predecessor. I think because our margin was so small and Kevin had such a difficult time obtaining the gavel in the first place — we went 15 rounds right before he was elected speaker — he had a challenge from day one, and when they reduced the motion to vacate threshold to one, it was always a sword of Damocles hanging over his head.</p><p>So I have a lot of sympathy for Kevin or anybody who serves in a position like this at a time like this. With all those factors, it's extremely difficult to do and to navigate those tough waters. I think history will record that he did the best he could under the circumstances. And that's exactly what I'm trying to do every day.</p><p><b>Lizza: It's interesting to hear you talk about bipartisanship and this respect for the famous relationship that Reagan and Tip O'Neill had. We're not really living in those times these days, obviously.</b></p><p><b>One of the biggest sources of friction in the country is the aftermath of the 2020 election and January 6th. Do you have any regrets about the role that you played after the 2020 presidential election, including the amicus brief in support of Texas' lawsuit challenging the election results?&#xa0;</b></p><p>No, I don't. My point in the amicus brief — people often ask me about this and they never read the brief — was a very simple and very profoundly important legal question. And that is, was the plain language of the Constitution violated in the days that led up to the 2020 election? And it very clearly was, because the language of the Constitution says plainly the state legislatures are the bodies in each of the states that determine the process by which electors are chosen. In a presidential election year, it's a critically important thing.</p><p>The operative language there is “state legislatures.” It doesn't mean election officials, secretaries of state, governors or any other body. And what happened because of Covid was everything was different. Everything was irregular. Some in good faith, and others not in such good faith, began to act at state levels to change their laws. They thought, “This is a presidential election year. How will people vote? Well, maybe we should do mail-in ballots to every voter in the state. Maybe we should put unmanned drop boxes in public parks for people to drop off their ballots. Maybe we should do all these things.”</p><p>Some of that was well-intended, perhaps. But the problem is, none of that was ratified by state legislatures because the legislatures weren't meeting and they don't do proxy voting. By extension, that clearly violated the plain language of the Constitution.</p><p>Now remember my background as a constitutional law attorney. For 20 years, I litigated constitutional questions in the courts. And to me, this was just such a plain and very important question to be answered. The only mechanism we had to present that to the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court, was to attach it along to that Texas case that was going to be before the court. That's why the amicus brief was filed there. The Supreme Court dodged the question. Perhaps they calculated that the answer was so profound, it would be so unsettling, and it was not worth them addressing, but well.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/4e/2e/f1bc0daf4db5abad3352ea40b815/house-speakership-election-27457.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Lizza: There was also a question of whether there was a remedy.&#xa0;</b></p><p>Maybe so. But listen, I think fidelity to the Constitution, even in difficult times, is critically important for us. And I thought that was an important question to pose to the court. And so you asked me if I regret that? I don't. I would do the exact same thing today if the circumstances were presented, because I feel like I have a duty. I'm an officer of the Congress and I have a responsibility. We take an oath to uphold the Constitution, and if it's plainly on its face not being followed, I have an obligation as an officer of this body to present that to the judicial branch.</p><p><b>Lizza: So if you were speaker on January 6, 2021, would you have done anything differently?</b></p><p>I don't know. I've never thought — I've never tried to assess that. That was an unprecedented moment at a very difficult time in the country. I'm not sure what I would have done at that point.</p><p><b>Lizza: Some like lightning round questions: Do you anticipate putting forward any legislation on abortion before the election?</b></p><p>No.</p><p><b>Bade: If there is Republican control of both chambers of Congress and the White House next year, do you anticipate passing any sort of nationwide abortion ban?</b></p><p>No, I don't.</p><p>President Trump said this is in the states' purview now. After the <i>Dobbs</i> decision, I think that's where it is. Look, I am a lifelong pro-lifer. I'm a product of a teen pregnancy. And so I believe in the sanctity of human life. It's also an important article of faith for me. But I have 434 colleagues here. All of us have our own, philosophical principles that we live by, but you have to have a political consensus.</p><p>[Andrew] Breitbart said, politics is downstream from culture. He's right. Before you can have political consensus on a very contentious issue like this, you have to have cultural consensus. And I think there's a lot of work to do to build a culture of life and educate people on the importance of that and to really live up to the principles of our nation's birth certificate, which is the declaration that “all men are created equal.” And there's value in that. But we have a long way to go to build the political consensus here to do anything in that regard.</p><p><b>Lizza<i>:</i> Do you think the president should have absolute immunity from prosecution?</b></p><p>Which president?

Look, imitation is the greatest form of flattery.</p><p><b>Lizza: Do you feel like he's got enough of a sense of humor that he would be okay?</b></p><p>Oh, yeah. No, he would laugh. We have a good time together. I think he'd be flattered by it. People love that. It humanizes him. And I think he's got thick skin.</p><p><b>Lizza: You think Donald Trump has thick skin?</b></p><p>I do, I really do.</p><p><b>Lizza: I mean, of all the things about Donald Trump, I don't think anyone's ever accused him of having thick skin.</b></p><p>They're not assessing what he's been enduring. I've been taking arrows here for six months. Donald Trump has taken nuclear incoming every single day since he came down the golden staircase. I mean, you can't say that guy's not tough as nails. No one else could endure what he has had to endure. Nobody.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/69/d6/fc1ac97443a4b1c9be74cc0de7fb/mag-lizza-deepdive-johnson-014.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Bade: Let's talk about a future Speaker Johnson.

Jerry Nadler&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/05/04/jerry-nadler-antisemitism-bill-00156105&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4ca0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4ca0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>Rep. Jerry Nadler</b></a><b>. His question was: What do you think is the future of democracy in this country?</b></p><p>I am very bullish on the future. I genuinely believe what Reagan said. Actually, Lincoln said it first. But Reagan reminded us that we are the last, best hope of man on the earth, this constitutional republic, that we have a grand experiment on the world stage. We turn 248 years old on July 4th. It's a big birthday for us. We’re coming up on 250 years. That is about the average lifespan of many great societies and cultures and we're coming to a moment. Doctor Os Guinness is an author friend of mine, and he wrote a book.</p><p><b>Lizza: You had him on your podcast.</b></p><p>I did. He's brilliant. He says that there comes a moment in a great society, a civilizational moment, where the people have to decide whether they are going to tie themselves in again to the founding principles that made that great society, or they're going to jettison that in exchange for something else. And he makes the point that over history, every time the jettison has happened, it's destroyed the culture. We have to make that decision now.</p><p><b>Lizza: On one of those podcasts, you noted that Trumpism was <i>necessary</i>, but that you were also concerned about what is being lost from traditional conservatism. What do you think is being lost?&#xa0;</b></p><p>So in 2019, I got elected to be chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the largest caucus of conservatives in Congress. At that time, we had 158 members. All the self-described conservatives in the House are part of that group. And so I stood in front of my peers and I said, gee, thanks for making me the chair. Here's what I want to posit to you all. This is 2019, two years into the Trump administration. It was a tumultuous time in the country for lots of reasons. And I felt like a lot of people back home and some of my own colleagues in the building, we were losing our sense of who we are. Like, what does it mean to be an American conservative?</p><p>I said, y'all forgive me. I'm from Louisiana. Everything's explained in either a football or hurricane metaphor. But using the hurricane metaphor, we're in uncharted waters. We feel like we've lost the rudder and we're afloat on this tumultuous sea.</p><p>I think if we created a working group to come up with a definition of American conservatism today, I think it would come down to a simple list. Today I would posit what I call the seven core principles of American conservatism. I said, I think it boils down to this: individual freedom, limited government, the rule of law, peace through strength, fiscal responsibility, free markets and human dignity. We need to be able to speak with greater clarity, conviction and consistency right now than we ever have, because people need answers and we can't go out and just say what we're against; we have to say we're for. I call them the core principles of American conservatism, but I actually think they’re the core principles of America. I think that's the reason that we became the great nation that we are, and I think we're losing it.</p><p><b>Lizza: That's not Trump's list though.&#xa0;</b></p><p>I think he's pursuing most of those principles. I really do. Now, he might define it differently — as many, many colleagues and conservatives do.</p><p>We have people in the building who have disdain for those founding principles. I mean openly, they would rather trade those for something else. They envision that we should be some sort of European-style socialist utopia or something. I believe that's a fool's errand. And so my job every day is to, in the most winsome way I can, be a happy warrior, as Reagan envisioned, to try to advance and advocate for those core principles that I think are going to help us save the Republic.</p><p><b>Lizza: What do you want us to ask our next guest?</b></p><p>How about, what makes you proud to be an American? That's a good one.</p><p><b>Lizza: What's your answer?</b></p><p>The idea that we do live in the greatest country in the history of the world. I don't even think it's close. And I don't have any problem defending that. You know, I'm a lawyer. And if you gave me time, I’d put on my full case to prove it.</p><p><i>Listen to this episode of Playbook Deep Dive on </i><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;i>Apple&lt;/i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4ca0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4ca0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>Apple</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0YmkWN5cyxuqBh5Vl78yGp?si=2efebaede0b8453e" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;i>Spotify&lt;/i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/0YmkWN5cyxuqBh5Vl78yGp?si=2efebaede0b8453e&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4ca0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4ca0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>Spotify</i></a><i>, or wherever you get your podcasts.</i><br /></p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

On Tuesday and Thursday, the former president was forced to sit and listen to explosive and at times lewd testimony from Stormy Daniels, who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/trump-hush-money-trial-stormy-daniels-testimony-00156744" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;described in some detail the sex that they had&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/trump-hush-money-trial-stormy-daniels-testimony-00156744&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d00001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">described in some detail the sex that they had</a>. Trump defense attorney Susan Necheles also brought up some of Daniels’ former public insults directed towards Trump, sure to make the former president’s blood boil, including “<a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/07/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/daniels-spars-with-necheles-00156649" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;I don’t owe him shit and I’ll never give that orange turd a dime&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/07/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/daniels-spars-with-necheles-00156649&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d00003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">I don’t owe him shit and I’ll never give that orange turd a dime</a>.”</p><p>While sitting through testimony from Daniels that sounded at times designed to humiliate him — Necheles at one point brought up Daniels’ comments that when she saw Trump in his underwear she almost fainted — Trump was visibly huffing and puffing, shaking his head, and shifting in his seat. At one point, he <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/07/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/trump-appears-upset-00156516" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;seemed to mouth “bullshit,”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/07/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/trump-appears-upset-00156516&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d00004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d00005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">seemed to mouth “bullshit,”</a> behavior demonstrable enough that Merchan <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/09/trump-stormy-daniels-trial-testimony-00157192" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;instructed his lawyers to get him to cool off&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/09/trump-stormy-daniels-trial-testimony-00157192&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d00006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d00007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">instructed his lawyers to get him to cool off</a>.</p><p>That request might be categorically impossible to fulfill. Since he burst onto the political scene, Trump’s appeal to Republicans was precisely his attack dog mentality — leave no slight unpunished, no rival unbruised, and always exact revenge. In his 2007 book “Think Big,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/330325949847597056" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;explained his first rule of business&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/330325949847597056&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d00008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d00009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">explained his first rule of business</a>: “Always get even. When you are in business, you need to get even with people who screw you.”</p><p>Charting his political career, it’s easy to see that mentality playing out in real time. He’s purged the Republican Party of his detractors, insulted and disparaged his skeptics, and driven out of office some of the GOP’s most prominent politicians. Of the ten House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after Jan. 6, only two remain in Congress — in no small part due to his efforts.</p><p>Trump’s scorched earth strategy has made him one of the most polarizing presidents ever to hold office, but it’s also propelled the unshakable loyalty that many of his supporters have for him. In court this week, however, his political superpower — the willingness to launch shock-and-awe, no-holds-barred personal attacks on his foes — was neutralized.</p><p>He’s been forced to rely on surrogates without the charisma or the killer instinct to deliver his message.</p><p>“What’s happening in this courtroom is clearly criminal.

When the adult film star returned to court on Thursday, Trump was a bit more cowed. At some point, soon, though, he might no longer be able to contain his frustration.</p><p>Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said Friday that <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/10/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/judge-wants-cohen-to-stop-talking-00157362" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;there are likely only two witnesses remaining in the prosecution’s case-in-chief&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/10/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/judge-wants-cohen-to-stop-talking-00157362&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d10002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d10003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">there are likely only two witnesses remaining in the prosecution’s case-in-chief</a>. “It’s entirely possible that we will rest by the end of next week,” Steinglass said.</p><p>Even so, it’s a week that’s likely to test Trump like no other.

Not on social media, where she’s quick to clap back at ugly memes and derogatory jabs. And not in a courtroom, where, on a witness stand in Donald Trump’s hush money trial this week, she proudly described her pornography career, defended herself from charges of money-grubbing and deflected criticism of a strip club tour called “Make America Horny Again.”</p><p>Sex scandals have come a long way since the Bill Clinton days.</p><p>That’s a major takeaway from this week’s courtroom spectacle, when Daniels calmly testified about hotel room dalliances and sexual positions and the clumsy come-ons from a future U.S. president — and the media took copious notes. In some ways, the excitement around the trial was a throwback to the political and legal scandals of the 1990s, when Clinton’s alleged sexual harassment and illicit affairs led to lawsuits, investigations and impeachment. Then, as now, there was breathless interest from the press, aw-shucks reporting of salacious details, palpable glee from late-night comedians.</p><p>But there’s also a crucial difference. The women at the center of the 1990s scandals, Paula Jones, who sued Clinton for sexual harassment in the mid-1990s, and Monica Lewinsky, the intern at the center of Clinton’s impeachment, were mocked and belittled, frequently dismissed, dragged unwittingly into the arena and left to suffer there alone. At one memorable point in the saga, Jones broke down crying at a press conference; the spotlight was too harsh, the pressure was too much.</p><p>At Trump’s trial, it was his longtime aide Hope Hicks who sobbed under pressure on the witness stand. Daniels, the woman with the bedroom stories, seemed unfazed. That says something about her own personality: confident, defiant, sex-positive. But it also says something about a culture that gives her more freedom to present herself that way — and the tools to push back at her detractors.</p><p>Anyone who lived through the Clinton scandals remembers the deep unkindness to the women at their center, and the power dynamics that made the cruelty possible. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB899939190484772500" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;A 1998&#xa0;&lt;i>Wall Street Journal&lt;/i>&#xa0;editorial called Lewinsky a “little tart.”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB899939190484772500&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d50001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">A 1998&#xa0;<i>Wall Street Journal</i>&#xa0;editorial called Lewinsky a “little tart.”</a> Men with late-night television megaphones mocked Lewinsky’s weight and Jones’ nose. Men at the center of politics made dismissive statements that revealed as much class snobbery as misogyny: James Carville famously said of Jones, “Drag a hundred-dollar bill through a trailer park, you never know what you’ll find.”</p><p>Today, Trump’s defense attorneys are using the same playbook to try to neutralize Daniels’ testimony, arguing that she was an unsavory character, looking for extortion money, when she took a $130,000 payment for hiding her story. But Daniels cuts a decidedly different figure. She’s older, for one, and battle-tested. But she’s also far less capable of being shamed. Her long career in the adult film industry, where she rose from actress to director and impresario, inoculates her from much of the knee-jerk derision. It also gives her a sense of agency that Lewinsky and Jones never had, and the freedom to push back at old slut-shaming tropes. In the courtroom on Thursday, when Trump’s defense attorney took a backhanded jab at Daniels’ career —"So you have a lot of experience making phony stories about sex appear real?" — Daniels had a quick, unbothered reply. “The sex is real,” she said. "That's why it’s pornography."<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352362261112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>That perfunctory defiance helps explain why, while Daniels has been at center of late-night jokes this week, she’s seldom been the butt of them. On “The Daily Show,” host Jordan Klepper focused on Trump himself and the media’s oddball fascination: “You’re very prudish for people whose names sound like porn names,” he said, after playing a clip of CNN’s Dana Bash and Jake Tapper, acting like the trial coverage made them squeamish. On ABC, Jimmy Kimmel focused on the circus itself: “The judge said Stormy could testify about her sexual relationship with Trump, but also said, ‘We don’t need to know the details.’ … Yes, we do need to know the details. Some of us are trying to host a show here, OK?” (Daniels’ Thursday testimony about a paranormal reality show and a supposedly-haunted house that was actually occupied by a possum might provide a <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/weird/paranormal-possum-cnns-entire-coverage-team-wheezes-with-laughter-at-bizarre-turn-in-trump-stormy-daniels-cross/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;fresh round of fodder&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.mediaite.com/weird/paranormal-possum-cnns-entire-coverage-team-wheezes-with-laughter-at-bizarre-turn-in-trump-stormy-daniels-cross/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d50002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d50003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">fresh round of fodder</a>, but it won’t be about sex.)</p><p>It's fair to wonder whether the mainstream media would be so credulous of Daniels, or so relatively kind, if someone other than Trump were on trial. Indeed, some of Trump’s right-wing media defenders have been less hesitant to challenge Daniels’ credibility. On Fox News this week, the female host Kennedy made an old-school jab: “Her being surprised that she was going to a hotel room alone with a man to have body congress is like Pete Sampras being surprised at being invited to a tennis court and you want to see his serve.”</p><p>Still, it’s clear that, for many outlets, the ground rules around covering sexual dynamics have changed. The #MeToo scandal shone a light on power differentials and forced some revisionist thinking in the media and beyond — creating possibilities that never existed in the 1990s, says <a href="https://www.leoratanenbaum.com/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715300046493,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715300046493,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82ce-d251-affe-ffde3ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.leoratanenbaum.com/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fd9-dcc8-addf-dfdf7dc50001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Leora Tanenbaum&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5fd9-dcc8-addf-dfdf7dc50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Leora Tanenbaum</a>, an expert on slut-shaming whose books include “SLUT! Growing up Female with a Bad Reputation.”</p><p>Back then, “we didn’t even have the language to describe being trashed as a result of the sexual double standard,” Tanenbaum wrote in an email. “It was normalized to hold the mindset that boys will be boys — and girls will be sluts. As a result, there’s nothing these women could have done differently at the time to be taken seriously.”<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352592873112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>This shift has no doubt been aided by other changes in the past few decades — for one, social media. It takes a fair amount of fortitude to play in an arena where body-shaming and generalized cruelty are still the standard currency, but Daniels uses her accounts with confidence, honing her straight-shooting persona and pushing back at critics who want to reduce her to sexist tropes. When someone recently wrote on X, “it’s crazy your greatest life achievement is fornication with a married man,” <a href="https://twitter.com/StormyDaniels/status/1778835726513102990" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Daniels shot back&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/StormyDaniels/status/1778835726513102990&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d50004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d50005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Daniels shot back</a>, “True! He was married to me and the achievement is our daughter.” If Jones and Lewinsky had had the power to correct rumors in real time, and speak in their own voices, one wonders how different the ’90s would have been.</p><p>Still, Tanenbaum cautions against claiming too much progress. There’s still a double standard, she contends, when it comes to women talking about sex: When Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion performed their explicit song “WAP” at the 2021 Grammy Awards, the Federal Communications Commission received over 1,000 complaints. And Tanenbaum takes issue with the media for always identifying Daniels as a “porn star” or “adult film actress,” which she says conditions readers to think she can’t be taken seriously. “Her profession is not relevant at all to this criminal trial unless you believe that women who work in the sex industry are untrustworthy,” Tanenbaum says.</p><p>But there are signs that, as it works through every angle of the Trump trial story, the press is treating adult film workers with a newfound respect. On CNN on Tuesday, Tapper conducted a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/justice/2024/05/08/the-lead-alana-evans-stormy-daniels-testimony-trump-trial-jake-tapper.cnn" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;strikingly conventional interview&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/justice/2024/05/08/the-lead-alana-evans-stormy-daniels-testimony-trump-trial-jake-tapper.cnn&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d50006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d50007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">strikingly conventional interview</a> with another porn actress, Alana Evans, who had been at Lake Tahoe around the time of Daniels’ first encounter with Trump. There was no indication that it was anything but an ordinary chat with an ordinary cable news guest.</p><p>More broadly, in the political world, people from unlikely corners are starting to push back against the stigmas around women and sex. Last winter, freshman U.S. Rep. Brandon Williams (R-N.Y.) <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/08/brandon-williams-interview-video-former-aides-00130713" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;told POLITICO that two former aides were threatening to expose his daughter’s OnlyFans account&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/08/brandon-williams-interview-video-former-aides-00130713&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d50008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4d50009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">told POLITICO that two former aides were threatening to expose his daughter’s OnlyFans account</a>.

Then came the prosecutors’ most notable and attention-grabbing witness to date — the former adult film star <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/stormy-daniels-testify-trump-trial-00156522" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Stormy Daniels&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/07/stormy-daniels-testify-trump-trial-00156522&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4db0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4db0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Stormy Daniels</a>. It was a remarkable and distinctly awkward affair for the former president, who sat through hours of detailed and embarrassing testimony about their alleged extramarital sexual relationship.</p><p>But thanks to the absence of cameras in the courtroom — and despite the wall-to-wall coverage — there’s much that remains unclear to those of us on the outside, regarding Daniels and much else.

The timing of her testimony was a surprise to those of us on the outside. What was the scene like in the courtroom and the courthouse when this news started to make the rounds?</b></p><p><b>Feuerherd: </b>To start the day, things were at a fever pitch, because Monday left off with Trump in the hallway basically saying, “I’ll go to jail. I’ll violate the gag order.” Then before he even arrived at court, he sent a message on Truth Social that appeared to address a witness taking the stand. I was waiting: “Could this be the day where Trump walks out in the hallway and breaks the gag order to put the ball in the judge’s court?”</p><p>All the drama on Tuesday was in the courtroom, not outside the courtroom. It was a stark difference from Monday, where the testimony was kind of dry yet important to the prosecution, but all the drama was seemingly playing outside with Trump’s comments about the gag order.</p><p><b>Josh, you were in the courtroom Tuesday. Can you just talk about what the reaction was among the jurors during Daniels’ testimony? You reported that at least one juror put her hand to her head and looked away. Can you talk a little bit about that, and what you saw from the whole panel of jurors? &#xa0;</b></p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>As Ben mentioned, on Monday, they seemed kind of bored. I think anybody would be by the time you’re going through the ninth, 10th or 11th monthly invoice for some kind of payment. The witnesses that they had on Monday were not the most electric ones you’re ever going to see on the witness stand. Bookkeepers and corporate controllers don’t tend to really color outside the lines, so people looked a little bit bored, which is not to say they weren’t paying attention. I’ve covered a lot of trials, and when jurors are not paying attention or actually nodding off, you see that, and that wasn’t happening, although some of them were staring around looking out at the gallery and the press corps.</p><br /><p>As we moved into Tuesday, after Stormy Daniels had come in and taken the stand, which was a dramatic entry — not that anything that exciting or flashy happened — they were really, really focused on her, and I think the jurors understood that she’s sort of the central figure of the case, at least in the pop culture assessment of it. I’m not sure that she’s the central figure in that case legally.</p><p>She’s become a larger-than-life figure, and I think people treated her that way. The thing you’re alluding to — I think it wasn’t that people were uncomfortable through the entire testimony, but it was certain details that she shared at different points about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump that got into some of the nitty gritty that the judge later said, “You know, I think some things were probably said that didn’t need to be said.”</p><p>That was when I saw some jurors kind of cringing or smiling a little bit awkwardly — and one kind of looking away and put her hand on her forehead — so there was some discomfort with some of the more tawdry aspects. If anybody was dozing off during that particular exchange, they would have been quickly woken because there was a flurry of action back and forth, as Trump’s lawyers naturally objected to many of those things being put on the record in this trial.</p><p><b>What was it that exactly frustrated the judge? There were a couple of lines in Daniels’ testimony that implied that their encounter may not have been consensual, when she said she blacked out. Ironically, that testimony or that allusion is much more prejudicial against Trump than the normal defendant because he has actually </b><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/05/09/verdict-trump-sexual-assault-trial-00096039" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;b>sexually abused women in non-consensual ways&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/05/09/verdict-trump-sexual-assault-trial-00096039&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4db0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4db0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>sexually abused women in non-consensual ways</b></a><b> before, so I get the judge’s concern on that front.</b></p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>The judge didn’t really explain that, but I think going into the hearing, he had made clear that he didn’t think that there needed to be a lot of detail provided. The facts that came out — at one point, she said, “This was missionary position,” or there was a question about whether he used a condom and things like that.</p><p>Now, these are things that she has already talked about in interviews. For goodness sake, she wrote a book about it, right? So this stuff is out there, but to have her say it in Trump’s physical presence was obviously a new thing.</p><p>I think the thing you mentioned, Ankush, was a big part of it. This notion that the sex might have not been consensual.</p><p>She has been pretty clear in her previous accounts. Some people have said, “Oh, it sounds like you were date raped, or sexually assaulted by Trump.” And I know of previous interviews where Daniels said, “I’m not saying that that’s what happened.” It may have just been her nervousness and word choice going from saying, “I don’t have a clear memory of everything that happened that night” versus saying, “I blacked out,” which then you start thinking, you know, is this a Bill Cosby kind of thing?</p><p><b>Well, you also might start thinking, “Is it a Donald Trump thing?”</b></p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>That’s a problem. I do also think the judge felt that while it was OK to talk about the encounter, that this really should not be a trial about that encounter. It’s not a sexual assault trial. It’s a trial about something else.</p><p>I think you can actually argue that it shouldn’t matter much for the outcome of his case whether this event happened the way Stormy Daniels described it or not, or to some extent whether it may not have happened at all. I don’t really quite see how that figures entirely into the merits of the case.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Can I offer you my own two cents on that? There is definitely a way that the prosecutors could have put on this case without having to take a position on whether this encounter actually happened, but there are several problems with that.</b></p><p><b>First, Trump has denied it repeatedly for years, and Trump’s lawyer repeated the denial in his opening statement, so if you’re the prosecutors, and this is part of the story, you absolutely have to prove that it happened, including by having the only other person in the room provide as much detail as possible to shore up their credibility.</b></p><p><b>Also, we’re hearing a lot of pro-Trump spin on Daniels’ testimony — about how it was a disaster, she was irrelevant or whatever. Trump could have preempted this witness — possibly entirely — if he just admitted that the encounter had happened. Smart criminal defenses do sometimes concede unpleasant facts in order to get the jury to focus on the material ones that might actually get the defendant off. Trump himself played an essential role in bringing her to the stand.</b></p><p><b>All that said, what is Trump doing through all of this? What is he physically doing during this very strange testimony?</b></p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>I’ll tell you what I could see, and then Ben can chime in.</p><p>I could see that he wasn’t really looking at Daniels. The way the courtroom is constructed, it’s a little bit odd. I think it’s a bit hard to see the person in the witness box and on the witness stand from the defendant’s table, at least where Trump is sitting. The judge’s bench is kind of in the way.</p><p>There was one moment during the Tuesday proceedings where the prosecutors asked, kind of dramatically, for Daniels to identify Trump, and she had to lean around the judge’s bench and crane her neck a bit and then, you know, pointed at him. Obviously, she had seen him coming into the courtroom; she knew he was there. But she had to do that.</p><p>Trump was making a deliberate effort to not acknowledge her in the courtroom and stare straight ahead. He had the opportunity to see her because there’s a couple different TV monitors that are on the counsel table and elsewhere in the courtroom, so it’s not like he couldn’t see or hear.</p><p>And he had trouble controlling his reactions. There were different times when he started shifting around and seemed to be mumbling, and the judge eventually called him out for that, at least privately.</p><p><b>Feuerherd: </b>The one main thing that I saw and that we’ve reported is that when Daniels was describing rolling up his magazine swatting him on the backside with it, Trump sort of laid back in his chair, and I saw in the feed that he mouthed, “Bullshit.”</p><p>It was later raised at sidebar. The judge talked to Todd Blanche, Trump’s attorney, and said, “Your client is audibly cursing, and that’s contemptuous, and I’m not gonna stand for it.</p><p><b>Meridith, this is now like the third trial in a year in which Trump’s mistreatment of women is really at the heart of the case. We had two E. Jean Carroll trials where he was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation to the tune of nearly $100 million. That was nonconsensual, so there’s a big distinction there.</b></p><p><b>But now we have Trump cheating on his wife with an adult film star. Has any of this dented Trump’s standing with women voters heading into this election?</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>Trump has always had a women problem. We saw that in 2016. He made slight improvements in 2020 with women voters, but there still really is a big gender gap between Trump and President Biden when it comes to women voters. A lot of that has to do with reproductive rights and abortion, which continue to be top of mind for a lot of those more moderate women who might be trying to decide who they’re going to vote for in the upcoming election.</p><p>Some of the suburban women that Trump really has struggled with in the past, when it comes to the E. Jean Carroll case, at least among Republican voters, I don’t think it’s made a huge difference. I think a lot of them have been able to grapple with Trump and his personal issues, warts and all.</p><p>Still, when it comes to Trump’s issue with women in the upcoming election, this does not help.</p><p>You heard Hope Hicks, when she was on the witness stand, say that she didn’t think about the Stormy Daniels issue hurting with women in 2016, but she did think that it could hurt with voters after the fact. So I do think it could be one of many issues that Trump has with women in 2024.</p><p><b>Where is Melania in all of this? She’s been keeping a low profile, but ideally, I would think if you’re running for reelection, your wife — the former first lady — would be a prominent surrogate.</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>Melania continues to be a mystery. Nobody is ever really quite sure how she spends her day. She’s incredibly private and spends a lot of time with her family. Her mother recently died, and Barron Trump is going to be heading off to college.</p><p>We’ve heard from some of her former aides about how she might be taking this. She’s probably watching all of this incredibly closely. The Stormy Daniels affair allegations really bothered her. Obviously, it came right after she gave birth to her son, Barron.<br /></p><br /><p>She’s probably following along with all of this. We’ve only seen her come out on the campaign trail — oh, gosh, the last public appearance she had was at a Log Cabin Republicans event, but it was incredibly small. The campaign has said that we’re going to be seeing more of her at some point, but right now, with the Stormy Daniels headlines, I’m not sure if that’s going to be anytime soon.</p><p><b>Does she believe that this sexual encounter with Daniels happened, or does she have the view that Daniels is making it up?</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>One of her former aides said that Melania Trump is always about the proof, wanting to have ironclad proof for things. She really is a lot like her husband in that she is skeptical and dismissive of the media and critics and anybody who undermines them.</p><p>At the same time, Trump has a longstanding reputation with women that I’m sure Melania Trump is well aware of.</p><p><b>Kyle, the contempt proceedings were another big event this week.

It’s not the first time he’s violated a gag order in one of his legal cases. Do you think he really cannot help himself? Or does he think that this is helpful to him as some sort of legal strategy or political strategy or both?</b></p><p><b>Cheney: </b>I actually think he can help himself. It’s actually a salient point, because when he goes out into the hallway for interviews, he sort of knows where the line is and is strategic about what he says. In many of his social media posts — even the ones that crossed the line — you can sort of see at least some semblance of an effort to find the contours of the gag order and push right up to the limit.</p><p>At times, he clearly has exceeded that limit when he talks about witnesses. And some of them were reposts of others’ posts, which is kind of a novel legal issue. Even Justice Merchan has had to say that this is the first time this has ever been ruled on, but I’m ruling against you.</p><p>So I think he knows the line, and that is salient, because, as Judge Chutkan has said in D.C., he knows exactly how to restrain himself when he’s told to. The gag order actually works in that he doesn’t say things that go so far over the line, but obviously he has trouble finding exactly where that line is.</p><p>I also think that Trump — in a very deep psychological way — does not want to go to jail, even though he thinks it would be a political windfall for him. Also, personally he doesn’t want to be in prison. So I think that he’s of two minds on that, knowing what the good politics is versus his own personal well-being.</p><p><b>McGraw: </b>At the psychological level, he does not want to go to jail. That’s been a fear of his, as Kyle was saying. He does these verbal gymnastics to push him right up against the edge, and the threat of jail is potent enough of a political threat that he hangs over his supporters.</p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>I think he doesn’t want to go. You’ve got to remember, at least before he ran for the presidency, this is a guy whose whole brand is creature comforts. He’s the epitome of what we used to call in the 1980s “champagne wishes and caviar dreams.” He’s not someone who’s going to find himself in jail being very tolerant in those kinds of conditions when he’s used to the more gilded surroundings that he prefers at Trump Tower, down at Mar-a-Lago and so forth.</p><p><b>Cheney: </b>He wants everyone to think that he’s willing to go to jail.</p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>I totally agree with Kyle. He revels in his tough guy image — you know, “This isn’t about me, this is about you, and if I have to take one for the country, I’m going to do that.”</p><p><b>Cheney: </b>Right before we jumped on here, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/trumptweets/comments/1cn39x3/5824_my_free_speech_was_taken_away_its_so_unfair/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;he posted something&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/trumptweets/comments/1cn39x3/5824_my_free_speech_was_taken_away_its_so_unfair/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4dc0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4dc0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">he posted something</a> saying “give me liberty or give me death” in the context of his gag order, his willingness to defend free speech. He certainly wants the impression out there even though I think he would fight tooth and nail to stay out of prison.</p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>The other thing I would say on that is that we can all think of things he could say that would violate the gag order and land him in jail. As Kyle has been alluding to, he hasn’t said those things yet. That makes me doubt that he’s someone who’s actually eager to spend time behind bars to become a martyr for his cause.</p><p><b>McGraw: </b>He’s a notorious germophobe, too.</p><p><b>Cheney: </b>That’s the psychological part. Exactly.</p><p><b>There’s no hair and makeup in jail, either.</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>No hair and makeup. He can’t control it.</p><p><b>Cheney:</b> Has to wear a jumpsuit.</p><p><b>Gerstein: </b>The coiffe was a little off, by the way, in court this week, since I had a lot of time to look at the back of his head. There was an over-extension on the left side that just was not symmetrical, and I was surprised that that went on for so long.</p><p><b>Feuerherd: </b>We gave him every opportunity to break the gag order — questions that, had he responded to them, arguably he would have broken the gag order. He steered clear of every one of those, but then at the end of the day, he said, “I’m ready to go to jail for the Constitution,” and yet did not respond to any questions that could have broken the gag order.</p><p><b>You know how I know he doesn’t want to go to jail? Josh is right, but a much more simple and efficient way to go to jail if he really meant it would just be to repost the Truth Social posts that got him held in contempt the first time. That’d be quick, easy and clearly in violation of the gag order, and the judge would be angry and would send him to jail. Trump isn’t doing that, which is why I know he doesn’t actually want to go to jail, at least not now.</b></p><p><b>Ben, we’re about halfway through the trial. You have been there every day. Can you talk about where you have seen successes for the prosecution and also for the defense?</b></p><p><b>Feuerherd: </b>The high point for the prosecution probably would have been [former National Enquirer publisher] David Pecker, just laying this foundation for this conspiracy that they allege in a very clear, concise way, discussing meetings in Trump Tower with Michael Cohen and Trump and then walking jurors through the end result of that, which was AMI entering into a non-prosecution agreement that said they broke campaign finance laws. He said, “I thought I was working for the campaign, not to protect Donald Trump’s name.”</p><p>You can make an argument that, for the defense, Hope Hicks painted Trump in a favorable light. She arguably scored some points for prosecutors, but also tried to protect Trump, dirtied Michael Cohen a little bit.</p><p><b>Cheney: </b>That speaks to this this [Harvey] Weinstein issue. His conviction was overturned in part because there was extraneous stuff that was introduced that was prejudicial to the case. There’s certainly not a parallel between these two cases, but you could see the contours of a similar argument here — that it was all this really prejudicial stuff that came in that had nothing to do with the underlying charges. Trump’s at least going to make a run at that if he is convicted.</p><p><b>Meredith, let’s talk about the political theater in the courtroom.</b></p><p><b>Ken Paxton showed up even though he has a full time job in Texas as attorney general. We’ve also had these political people who weren’t there initially but have shown up in the last week or two — Susie Wiles, Boris Epshteyn, Natalie Harp. What should we make of the fact that these political allies are showing up? Are they there to give him an ego boost?</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>I will say with Ken Paxton, he has shown up at all sorts of different Trump events I’ve been at. I think he is often very eager to show Trump just how loyal and with him he is. I have no doubt that that was the calculation with him.</p><p>The other names that you just gave — Susie Wiles, Boris, Natalie Harp, that’s really Trump’s inner circle. These are his top advisers — people who spend a lot of time with him every day — and this trial is a big part of his campaign message. They obviously don’t love the fact that Trump is spending all of his time in court and that this is what people are talking about in the election, but they’ve still tried to say that they’re making lemonade out of lemons with this and really trying to push this as part of their argument that Trump is somehow unfairly targeted.<br /></p><br /><p><br />But there is, of course, just an awareness that this is where we’re at in 2024. This is what the cards are that they’re having to deal with. Politically, they’re having to make this part of their case, whether they want to or not.</p><p><b>Cheney: </b>I actually think that it’s a little surprising there haven’t been more people showing up like Ken Paxton. I think Marjorie Taylor Greene showed up for some of the pretrial stuff.</p><p>Trump values loyalty maybe as his No. 1 attribute, and there’s no better way to show your loyalty than to stand with him in this moment. And yet, as I said, the people who are there — there’s his campaign apparatus, there’s his message apparatus, they would be expected to be with him anyway. It took a while even <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/06/trump-trial-new-york-melania-family-00156189" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;before his own family members&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/06/trump-trial-new-york-melania-family-00156189&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4dc0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4dc0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">before his own family members</a> showed up.</p><p><b>Meridith, is this trial taking a personal toll on Trump? To my eyes, it does look like he’s a little slumped down in his appearances, even when he’s in front of a camera — not just the pictures and the reporting from within the courtroom.</b></p><p><b>McGraw: </b>This is — especially Daniels’ testimony — it’s just been embarrassing for him to have all of these personal details out there even though he’s denied it.</p><p>I’m sure these are humiliating details to have talked about every day on the news. His people close to him have said that this is a kind of punishment for him in and of itself — that he obviously is not enjoying any of this. They’ve tried to make a political spectacle out of it, and they’ve tried to have these political events on the sidelines. He’s had sort of spirit-boosting events back at Mar-a-Lago where he’s been surrounded by allies, like when he was at Ronny Jackson’s birthday party this weekend.</p><p>But being in trial, day after day, I’m sure is grueling and taxing. And you see, like you said, physically how it’s impacted him.</p><p><br /></p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

Foreign policy was on the agenda, and the Ford team saw a major opportunity to brush back the former Georgia peanut farmer.</p><p>The biggest issue of the day was the Helsinki Accords, which cemented the post-World War II borders and were intended to ease tensions with the Soviet Union. Ford had come in for criticism that he had ceded too much to the Soviets and was ready when one of the moderators, the<i> New York Times’</i> Max Frankel, raised the charge.</p><p>The Pope endorsed Helsinki, Ford responded (in a bow to the campaign’s conviction that the Catholic vote was key). The whole of the West was behind it. And then, in a rhetorical flourish, he added: “There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration.”</p><p>The Ford campaign staff collectively blanched — National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft literally turned white — but Frankel threw the president a potential lifeline. “Did I understand you to say, sir, that the Russians are not using Eastern Europe as their own sphere of influence in occupying most of the countries there…?”</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/4d/ad/80abfdda4cf6a5a76884247f3717/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary1.jpg" /><br /><p>After asserting, correctly, that Yugoslavia and Romania did not consider themselves dominated, he added, “I don’t believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.” That was a bridge too far — a comment that made the president look delusional and soured key voters in communities filled with Europeans whose families had fled Soviet brutality.</p><p>It was a debate gaffe that arguably cost Ford the election and changed American history. Indeed, not only would there have been no President Jimmy Carter, there might have been no President Ronald Reagan or the conservative revolution he unleashed.</p><p><br /></p><br /><p><b>How did the election</b> get to that point, where such a misstep could tip the balance? Blame Watergate. The candidates might have bristled at the description, but the 1976 presidential campaign was arguably a race between two accidental nominees, both shaped by the fallout from Richard Nixon’s downfall.</p><p>When Ford became president on Aug. 8, 1974, after Nixon resigned, he had never been elected to national or even statewide office. He was the well-liked minority leader of the House when Nixon picked him to replace Spiro Agnew, who’d resigned from the vice presidency one step ahead of the sheriff. The House and Senate confirmed the choice, but the only voters who’d ever chosen him were those of his Grand Rapids, Michigan, congressional district.</p><p>Still, he’d entered the presidency on a wave of good feeling — exuding modesty (“I’m a Ford, not a Lincoln”), fixing his own breakfast and promising cooperation with the big Democratic majorities in Congress. Then things went sideways when he pardoned Nixon in an effort to spare the nation the prospect of an ex-president on trial. His press secretary resigned, his approval ratings sank and then came the more personal assaults. After a few spills, the most athletic president in history — he’d been offered a pro football contract — was portrayed as a bumbling fool, especially on a new late night TV show, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bvxZgCryUE" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;“Saturday Night Live.”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bvxZgCryUE&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4e60006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4e60007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">“Saturday Night Live.”</a> The cover of New York Magazine <a href="https://nymag.com/news/politics/46799/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;portrayed him, literally, as a clown&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nymag.com/news/politics/46799/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4e60008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4e60009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">portrayed him, literally, as a clown</a>.</p><p>More importantly, oil price hikes imposed by the OPEC cartel led to rising inflation and painful contractions in the auto industry, as customers sought out more fuel-efficient cars from Japan and Europe. The Ford administration’s lame PR effort — “a Whip Inflation Now” campaign — was met with ridicule. Then came the word from California: Former Gov. Ronald Reagan was going to challenge Ford for the Republican nomination, and Reagan ultimately came within a whisper of making Ford the first president since Chester Arthur to be denied his party’s nomination. When Ford invited Reagan to speak to the convention after his acceptance speech, it was clear who had the firmer grip on the heart and soul of the party.</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/7d/c6/1f85ce454f68ae676394852d2485/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary2.png" /><br /><p>It was Watergate that made Jimmy Carter, that most unlikely of candidates, the nominee of his party as well. Under ordinary circumstances, a former one-term governor from a Southern state who could go unrecognized by 9 out of 10 citizens would be laughed off the political stage (When he announced for president, his hometown paper headlined: “Jimmy Who Is Running for What!?”)</p><p>But after Nixon’s scandal, Carter’s bugs turned out to be features.</p><p>“I’m not from Washington,” he’d proclaimed. For the last four campaigns, every Democratic nominee for president and vice president was or had been a senator. But in this year, to be from somewhere else was to be free from the taint of scandal. (Reagan had the same advantage). Moreover, he was, in demeanor and background, without any trace of privilege or power: a peanut farmer from the ridiculously on-the-mark town of… Plains.</p><p>His campaign had no money, so he stayed at the homes of supporters, carrying his own bags, traveling with an entourage of two. His campaign themes were intensely personal: “I’ll never lie to you,” said the man who called for “a government as good as its people.”</p><p>After the party’s internecine blood baths of 1968 and 1972, Democrats had united, with everyone from Black politicians like Julian Bond and Rep. Andrew Young to the one-time segregationist George Wallace backing him. When the conventions were over, Carter had a 33-point lead over Ford. No wonder the sitting president, in a break with precedent, challenged his rival to debate.</p><p>One of the Ford campaign’s overriding goals was to turn Carter’s sudden emergence from obscurity into a liability, by asking again and again: “Do you really know what he believes in?” As attacks go, it was mild fare. (It was in fact a highly civil campaign, in which the charges of inconsistency were met by Carter calling Ford “a good and decent man” who had not accomplished anything of note in his tenure, though that did not stop journalist Barbara Walters from asking the candidates about “the low moral tone of the campaign.”)</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/0e/c4/947c87cc4c838929d29edd5db885/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary3.jpg" /><br /><p>But the argument began to cut, and at that first debate, Ford’s critique of an inconsistent, vague candidate hit home; when the two met for their second debate at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, Carter’s lead had dropped to single digits.</p><p>And then Ford stepped in it with his flippant remark about Poland and the Soviet Union.</p><p>In that pre-social media era, the backlash built over a couple days until the outrage was widespread, particularly among families of immigrants who loathed the Soviets.</p><p>It took a week for Ford to find his footing on the matter, including by offering an apologetic call to Aloysius Mazewski, president of the Polish‐American Congress — a week that broke the steady improvement in the campaign’s standing.</p><p>How critical was this setback? As Ford pollster Bob Teeter later said, “The controversy used up valuable campaign days when there were all too few left, when a steady climb had to be sustained.”</p><p>Even if it had a marginal impact, that margin would have been enough to change the outcome. Look at the results. Carter beat Ford by 1.7 million popular votes, but the Electoral College couldn’t have been closer.</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/26/e3/7f3a33e1466f9c7d20464ad3429a/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary4.jpg" /><br /><p>In Ohio, with 25 electoral votes — where the families of Catholic immigrants from Eastern Europe formed a significant share of the vote — Carter beat Ford by just 11,000 votes, a third of a percent of the 4 million votes cast. If 6,000 Ohio voters had changed their decision, along with 7,500 Mississippians, Ford would have remained in the White House. It was the narrowest victory in a hundred years, and nothing since has been closer except the 2000 election.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Had Ford held on</b> to the presidency, it would have changed the trajectory of American politics — potentially by denying Reagan his time in the White House.</p><p>Notably, Ford would have won despite losing the popular vote — the first time a popular vote loser won the presidency at that point since Benjamin Harrison in 1888. Ford also would have faced a Congress dominated by the opposition party Democrats, with little mandate to try to bend them to his will.</p><p>Yet as the sitting president, Ford would have been the most visible target for the discontent that the late 1970’s would bring to an America grappling for the first time in decades with structural economic woes.</p><p>Inflation, which had proven impervious to Ford’s “Whip Inflation Now” public relations campaign, grew steadily, fueled by a second “oil shock” that once again led to long gas lines. Ford would have begun his first full term with a 5.2 percent inflation rate; by March of 1978 it had almost doubled, and it stayed in double digits throughout the next two years. That inflation meant trouble in a wide range of fields, from the cost of a mortgage to a new automobile to prices at the supermarket.</p><p>The plummeting approval ratings that hit Jimmy Carter — he was disapproved of by a 54-33 percent margin at the end of 1979 — would likely have befallen Ford as well.</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/e8/0b/ad8823cb46ffbb834b7a7e2471fe/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary5.jpg" /><br /><p>Of course, Ford would have been in a very different position than Carter; having served more than half of Richard Nixon’s second term, Ford would have been ineligible to run again for the presidency in 1980 under the provisions of the 22nd Amendment. It would have fallen to a new candidate to attempt to hold the White House for the Republicans for a fourth consecutive term — something neither party had done (with the exception of the FDR-Truman five-term run) since 1908.</p><p>In 1980, Ronald Reagan could run against the beleaguered Carter administration and the Democrat-dominated Congress by pledging a wholesale rejection of the party in power. With a Republican like Ford in the White House, it would be difficult for Reagan — or any other Republican — to make a blistering critique of business as usual. There is a reason why only one president in the last century has managed to turn the White House over to a candidate of their own party, and Ford would have faced that challenge with bleak economic conditions.</p><p>It’s also likely Ford would have sought to undermine Reagan’s 1980 bid. Ford always believed that Reagan’s 1976 primary challenge, and his lackluster support of the ticket in the fall, was one key reason for his defeat. Had Ford managed to beat Carter, he would almost surely have held Reagan in “minimum high regard” and done all in his power to damage him.</p><p>What about the Democrats?</p><p>With Carter effectively out of the picture, Sen. Ted Kennedy would have been the clear favorite, as he in fact was at the outset of his primary challenge to President Carter’s renomination in 1980. (“I don’t think he can be denied the nomination if he wants it,” House Speaker Tip O’Neill said at the start of Kennedy’s bid.) But the obstacles to Kennedy that emerged during his campaign would have been equally present had Carter not occupied the White House.</p><p><br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/35/1f/15fce1904b19860720edcaa932c2/mag-greenfield-closestcalls-1976-secondary6.jpg" /><br /><p>In 1980, there was still a significant cohort of moderate and even conservative Democrats who resisted Ted Kennedy as the champion of his party’s left. Beyond that, of course, was Chappaquiddick, his 1969 drive off a bridge in Cape Cod that left Mary Jo Kopechne, a young campaign aide, to drown. Yes, it was more than a decade in the past, but as we saw in 1980, the press — so often derided as a Kennedy-friendly apparatus — had a powerful instinct to turn its attention to the front-runner. The series of highly critical accounts of his behavior — in a Readers’ Digest article heavily promoted with TV ads, in a “CBS Reports” documentary, in sketches on “Saturday Night Live,” would have been even more pointed in a campaign where Kennedy was so obviously the favorite. And there’s no guarantee that Kennedy’s answer in an interview with CBS’ Roger Mudd would have been any less wounding. (“Senator,” Mudd asked, “why do you want to be president?” The answer was a minutes-long word salad, interrupted by frequent stumbles and hesitations, that left even liberal journalists and columnists appalled).</p><p>Would Kennedy have survived the scrutiny? He did win 7.3 million primary votes against a sitting president — 37 percent of the total — along with key states like New York, California, and Pennsylvania. Could he have been upset by a fresh face on the national scene, like Arkansas’ Dale Bumpers or Colorado Sen. Gary Hart? (In one chapter of my alternative history book “Then Everything Changed,” I recounted that possibility). Would a Reagan candidacy have been fatally wounded by the unpopularity of a departing Republican president?</p><p>There are no certainties here. What can be said is that had Gerald Ford remembered not to liberate Poland prematurely at that debate in 1976, the Reagan revolution might never have happened.</p><br />]]></content:encoded>

Yet a small group of deeply unserious people has consumed an inordinate and growing amount of the speaker’s time over the last 12 years.</p><p>Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has given us fresh evidence of that this week as she threatened to pull the trigger on a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson only to deescalate — at least temporarily — after multiple meetings with him. But the standoff, for all its foolishness, gives the House a chance to reverse this drift and serve as a turning point toward becoming a more deliberative body once again.</p><p>Over the House’s more than two centuries, there has no doubt been all manner of cranks and questionable characters serving in the institution. It is a modern phenomenon, however, that we pay them so much attention. Today, congressional politics revolve around a rump group of lawmakers who typically hold no significant role on committees, often have served just a few terms, and whose rhetoric implies only a tenuous grasp of political reality.</p><p>We must stop taking them so seriously. We need a bipartisan pact that we’re going to stop letting the people who delight in the absurd have an outsize influence in the House. It would be good for the institution, good for Republicans and even good for Democrats.</p><p>Both parties have their gadflies and their fringes, but the reality is that the forces fueling historic levels of congressional dysfunction are coming from a small but growing group of Republican hard-liners. And it’s infected the culture of the broader House GOP. I’ve seen that up close, having previously served as an adviser to Speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan.</p><p>Lately, Greene has accused Johnson, a conservative derided by the left as “MAGA Mike,” of literally being a Democrat. She’s among a swath of Republicans who insist a tiny House majority can foist a conservative agenda upon a Senate and White House controlled by Democrats.</p><p>Similar nonsense was thrown at Johnson’s predecessors whenever they would strike a necessary bipartisan agreement. Republicans have indulged this ridiculous thinking too long; indeed, doing so has only emboldened the hard-liners from one speakership to the next.</p><p>Boehner could barely tolerate many members of the Freedom Caucus, and he did little to hide it. Ryan believed a dash of inclusivity and an open line of communication would moderate their worst instincts, and he held a weekly lunch with members from different pockets of the conference, including Freedom Caucus leaders. Kevin McCarthy went so far as to give the chair of the Freedom Caucus a seat at the leadership table.</p><p>No matter the approach, the threats from the far right never subsided.</p><p>Johnson similarly spent much of his first six months in office chasing around their unrealistic demands until he, surprising many, decided to pass a domestic funding agreement and a large foreign aid package with broad bipartisan support.</p><p>Greene’s threat to try to boot Johnson using the motion to vacate is the latest turn in a cycle that makes the House a miserable place to serve.</p><p>That’s why this moment offers an opportunity for both parties to begin to fix the House.</p><p>Democrats have already pledged the votes needed to protect Johnson, but only once. If Greene does reverse herself and force a vote against the speaker, he should be prepared to go further than just defeating it. He should call another vote to change the House rules so that one member alone cannot trigger the motion to vacate. This will require Democratic help, but it can be presented as a commitment to govern honestly rather than continually at the mercy of Greene or others operating on bad faith. Similarly, if hard-liners keep defeating procedural votes on the floor as they have in record number this year, Johnson should normalize the practice of bipartisan rules — again working with Democrats to effectively govern the floor if he must.</p><p>What people like Greene crave more than anything is attention. And the motion to vacate is their most potent tool for commanding it. It is the weapon that has, even in quieter times, hovered over the thinking of four straight GOP speakers. When that weapon is taken away, there is a completely different equation for leadership, allowing for rational decision making about what is best for the Republican Conference and the House.</p><p>Of course, taking away the motion to vacate does not solve all the speaker’s troubles. As we have seen in spectacular fashion this Congress, hard-liners can still make it more difficult to bring bills up for a vote, and they will still be able to raise money and play to the conservative media in ways that undermine their colleagues.</p><p>That is why this is not a problem that leadership alone can address. The rank and file, too, must not tolerate criticism that defies the obvious realities of divided government. There is a cultural peculiarity in the House GOP where it is almost taboo to say out loud that a conservative priority is not immediately achievable. Even behind closed doors, few words are devoted to what can reasonably be attained. Everything must be grounded in a fight for the maximalist position. And whenever conservatives foil a more realistic plan, they do so with impunity.</p><p>Change starts with a shift in culture of the House GOP Conference. It must be okay to say true things, like that hard-liners are making policy outcomes less conservative, not more, by refusing to back their own speaker.</p><p>As we have seen, change also requires cooperation from Democrats. It is reasonable for the minority party to question why they should be in the business of protecting a Republican speaker from conservative hard-liners. We should not pretend that Democrats’ primary goal isn’t to take back the House. And it is fair to believe continued chaos in the GOP majority sends a signal that it is not a party capable of governing. At the same time, there is also little evidence that these leadership fights break through with voters, especially by the time they go to the polls.</p><p>What’s more, should Democrats take back the House, it’s entirely possible they too will have a tiny majority, given how few competitive districts we now have. Democrats are not immune from party infighting, and it would be good for the whole House if both parties commit to rewarding sanity, not hijinks.</p><p>The alternative today for Democrats is a speaker more beholden to the hard-liners and an institution incapable of doing even basic responsibilities. A short-term assist to Greene or like-minded conservative bomb-throwers would do more long-term damage to an institution that nearly all bemoan as dysfunctional.</p><p>Morale on Capitol Hill is as low as anyone can remember. And why wouldn’t it be? Most weeks, little gets done, and the House is constantly under threat by people who have no interest in governing. This has contributed to an unmistakable trend of members retiring while still in their legislative prime. The U.S. House of Representatives has become a place where serious people feel like they don’t fit in.</p><p>Whether that continues is a choice. Johnson, to his credit, has shown that governance is possible if the loudest, most disingenuous voices are ignored.</p><p>If the hard-liners don’t like it, there is an alternative: act like a majority and back your speaker. And then win more elections so there are the actual conditions for conservative governance, not the pretend ones they’ve been operating under.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Wednesday will be the last workday for the group’s roughly 25 employees, though staffers will continue to receive paychecks and health care benefits for the next few months.</p><p>The development brings to a close a period of turmoil for the organization. FreedomWorks laid off <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2023/03/08/freedomworks-lays-off-40-percent-of-staff-00086188" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;40 percent&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2023/03/08/freedomworks-lays-off-40-percent-of-staff-00086188&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4eb0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4eb0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">40 percent</a> of its staff in March of 2023, and as a result of a drop in fundraising, its total revenue has declined by roughly half, to about $8 million, since 2022, Brandon said.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with POLITICO Magazine, Brandon said the decision to shut down was driven by the ideological upheaval of the Trump era.</p><p>After Trump took control of the conservative movement, Brandon said, a “huge gap” opened up between the libertarian principles of FreedomWorks leadership and the MAGA-style populism of its members. FreedomWorks leaders, for example, still believed in free trade, small government and a robust merit-based immigration system. Increasingly, however, those positions clashed with a Trump-aligned membership who called for tariffs on imported goods and a wall to keep immigrants out but were willing, in Brandon’s view, to remain silent as Trump’s administration added $8 trillion to the national debt.</p><p>“A lot of our base aged, and so the new activists that have come in [with] Trump, they tend to be much more populist,” Brandon said. “So you look at the base and that just kind of shifted.”</p><p>This same split was creating headaches in other parts of the organization as well. “Our staff became divided into MAGA and Never Trump factions,” Brandon said in an internal document reviewed by POLITICO Magazine. It also impacted fundraising.</p><p>“Now I think donors are saying, ‘What are you doing for Trump today?’” said Paul Beckner, a member of FreedomWorks’ board. “And we’re not for or against Trump. We’re for Trump if he’s doing what we agree with, and we’re against him if he’s not. And so I think we’ve seen an erosion of conservative donors.”</p><p>Brandon, for his part, said some donors would contact him to complain that the organization was doing too much to help Trump, while others called to complain that they weren’t doing enough to help Trump. “It is an impossible position,” he said.</p><p>In trying to balance these competing pressures, Brandon said he resolved to “keep a working relationship [with the pro-Trump populists] on the issues we agreed upon.” This too created conflicts.</p><p>In an interview with POLITICO Magazine last September, an ex-FreedomWorks employee <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715180108675,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d8-d8b7-a9bb-f7ff620d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715180108675,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d8-d8b7-a9bb-f7ff620d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58b3-d37b-a3ff-78bb73e60001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;claimed that the organization&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58b3-d37b-a3ff-78bb73e60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">claimed that the organization</a> under Brandon’s leadership had turned its back on its values while Trump was in office; during this period, for example, the organization issued tweets spreading election conspiracies and deflecting criticism of the Florida legislation that came to be known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. “He let a bunch of right-wing nutjobs turn FreedomWorks into a MAGA mouthpiece,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the former FreedomWorks staffer said&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4eb0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4eb0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the former FreedomWorks staffer said</a>.</p><p>Brandon said he “did my best to balance the two competing ideologies.”</p><p>In the midst of this turmoil, FreedomWorks <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715180164128,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d8-d8b7-a9bb-f7ff620d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715180164128,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000189-31d8-d8b7-a9bb-f7ff620d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58b4-dcc8-addf-d8bf49eb0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;launched an effort&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58b4-dcc8-addf-d8bf49eb0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">launched an effort</a> last fall to rebrand itself as a more centrist organization, one that could target the independent voters that its leaders believe would be more receptive to libertarian ideals.

As a result, Brandon and the board began discussing the possibility of shutting down FreedomWorks altogether. </p><p>“This has been my life for so long and to turn the lights off, it's a real emotional thing,” said Brandon, who joined FreedomWorks in 2005 and has been president for about a decade. “The problem is that it’s just not the best vehicle for our [libertarian] principles and values set.”</p><p>FreedomWorks, which was founded in 1984, grew out of the Koch-funded group Citizens for Sound Economy. FreedomWorks split apart from the Koch political network in 2004.</p><p>Brandon said he has plans to launch a new organization focused on politically independent members of the millennial and Gen Z generations, whom he thinks will be receptive to libertarian policies. “If we started something new, you could build it from the ground up,” Brandon said. “You could build a brand that matches what these folks want, and you could get away around all the baggage [associated with the FreedomWorks brand].”</p>]]></content:encoded>

It’s the latest example of how the conflict is straining center-left politics across the globe — and challenging the place of Jewish leaders in mainstream progressive politics.</p><p>“I was so distressed with my government’s position on this issue, I really contemplated whether or not I still belonged,” he said in an interview with POLITICO Magazine.</p><p>The progressive New Democratic Party had introduced a motion that called for the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state and a suspension of arms trading with Israel. Dozens of Liberals were said to be supportive. Up against a divided caucus, Trudeau’s government negotiated softer language, including support for a two-state solution and a halt to “further authorization and transfer of arms” to Israel.</p><p>During a dramatic vote in March, the amended motion was <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/members/en/votes/44/1/658" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;approved over the opposition&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ourcommons.ca/members/en/votes/44/1/658&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4ef0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4ef0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">approved over the opposition</a> of Conservatives and just three Liberals. That included Housefather, who left the House in a huff following his caucus’ standing ovation for the NDP.</p><p>For weeks, the three-term MP agonized over his future in the party. He spoke at length to family and friends, constituents, Jewish Canadians outside of his riding, and to Conservatives who entertained the idea of Housefather crossing the floor to join them on the opposition benches.</p><p>Housefather’s exit from the Liberals would have rocked Parliament and exacerbated tension within Trudeau’s caucus on the war in the Middle East.</p><p>Ultimately, he decided against bolting his party. And he recently opened up about his monthslong political rollercoaster, rising antisemitism in Canada and around the world, and how he responds to Jewish constituents when they confide their fears.</p><p><i>The following has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p><p><b>During the past couple of months, you were at odds frequently with your own caucus on Israel’s war against Hamas.</b></p><p>Since December of last year, pro-Israeli Canadians — including the vast majority of Jewish Canadians — were not happy with actions the government took, whether on the U.N. vote [to <a href="https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/un-onu/statements-declarations/2023-12-12-explanation-vote-explication.aspx?lang=eng" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;demand a cease-fire&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/un-onu/statements-declarations/2023-12-12-explanation-vote-explication.aspx?lang=eng&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4ef0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4ef0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">demand a cease-fire</a>], whether on the inability to articulate in the International Court of Justice that Israel wasn't committing genocide, whether on the funding of UNRWA and whether on this motion that came before the House where instead of voting against the NDP motion, the government decided to amend it.</p><p>I've been able to speak my mind and speak out publicly when I disagreed with what my party did. It allowed many people in the country, Jewish Canadians of all political persuasions and many Liberals who are pro-Israel across the country, to know their voices were not alone — that within the Liberal Party, there are voices that remain strongly pro-Israel, and that are incredibly concerned about the antisemitism in demonstrations and on campuses in this country.</p><p><b>Do you think your vote on that NDP motion forced some Liberals to rethink their views on the Israel-Hamas conflict?</b></p><p>I can't speak for everyone. What I can say is that a large number of my colleagues reached out over the weeks following that motion to tell me how much they wanted me to stay in caucus and to also try to better understand why it was that I was so disillusioned.</p><p>I had made my views very clear to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and her team, and to the Prime Minister's Office. But my caucus colleagues hadn't had the opportunity to hear from me. Since then, they <i>have</i> had the opportunity to hear from me on why antisemitism needs to be a high priority for the government domestically.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/99/92/2662c4a34ee8856c90addcdafd3b/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1235395136" /><br /><p>When Iran attacked Israel [in April], MPs suddenly realized they had voted for a motion that stopped us from allowing Canadian manufacturers to ship defensive military technology to Israel. So our democratic Western ally is being attacked by the biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. And yet, if it were up to this resolution in Canada, nobody should be shipping Israel anything to defend themselves. That woke people up.</p><p><b>The prime minister asked you to work on “concrete actions” with Deborah Lyons, Canada's special envoy for combating antisemitism. What can you say about that work?</b></p><p>I'm working on an action plan with Deborah.</p><p>We should not need to get injunctions in order to stop protests directly outside of churches, synagogues, schools, community centers. There has to be a protective bubble around those buildings.</p><p>In Montreal, now there's an injunction that's been continued yet again, after an incident where people blocked the Jewish community offices where the Jewish public library and the Holocaust Museum are. Nobody could enter or leave the building for three to four hours. You can't use your free speech rights to deny others their free speech rights.</p><p><b>What do your constituents expect of you?</b></p><p>Of course, they come to their MP. I'm not a pastor, or a rabbi or a counselor with any experience in psychological training, but they expect me and my government, and also the provincial or municipal governments that are largely left out of this, to solve the problem.</p><p><b>What are you hearing?&#xa0;</b></p><p>We're all talking about what's going on with antisemitism: What's going on on college campuses? What's going on in demonstrations? Should we move to the United States? Should we move to Israel?</p><p>The idea that there are Jewish Canadians that don't even know if their future is in this country — it is something that is horrific after this community has been here for the last 264 years.</p><p>I don't think anybody my age, or even alive today, ever expected to see things like this after the 1930s. Psychologically, it's devastating, to pretty much all Jewish Canadians, whatever their political perspective, whatever their history.</p><p>It's just a shock. It's not only Canada. This is happening in Western democracies across the world. It's happening in the United States. It's happening in Australia. It's happening in England. It's happening in France.</p><p><b>What do you tell constituents who are worried?</b></p><p>I empathize. I tell them I understand your fears, I understand your concerns. I talk about the fact that I brought a motion to the House of Commons justice committee, where we're going to be doing a study on antisemitism focused on college campuses. I talk about the fact that I've written to university presidents across the country and gotten answers from the 29 biggest Canadian universities. I'm also following up with universities regularly, and following up with students on campuses across the country.</p><p>I try to give them the glimmer of hope. The vast majority of Canadians are on our side, the vast majority of Canadians are not the people in the streets yelling hateful things. And the vast majority of Canadians just don't know what to do. But they also look on with horror about antisemitism in Canada.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/23/bb/c34038ca4d919214a22d374b2335/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1247878922" /><br /><p>The worst thing is for people to feel that the government doesn't care. The government cares very much. We just need to find the right ways to address it.</p><p><b>There was a lot of anticipation around you potentially leaving the Liberals. How seriously did you consider that option?</b></p><p>When my colleagues joined in to give a standing ovation to the NDP member who sponsored the original anti-Israel motion, it was very disappointing. I was so distressed with my government's position on this issue, I really contemplated whether or not I still belonged. That was the struggle.</p><p>I'm much more of a centrist. My positions on not just Israel but on a number of issues are very centrist. I believe the Liberal Party has to be a place for the center-left and the center-right and the center — not just the left. I wanted to reconcile my views with the fact that on a number of issues, I haven't been in agreement. I ended up coming to the conclusion that if people like me left the Liberal Party, then the centrist values that I espouse would be absent from the party that's in power in Canada most of the time.</p><p>I had so many Canadians from across the country, that were non-Jewish liberals, who said, "Please, please stay. Because when you speak, you speak for me. I want to know that my views do have a place in the party." That made a difference.</p><p><b>Did you visualize yourself as a Conservative?</b></p><p>Political parties are not black and white. This party is not perfect, and this party is not horrible. Political parties are creatures of an amalgam of people and amalgam of values. I just don't believe that other parties are inherently evil, or are inherently good.</p><p>Is the right answer to leave and not be a voice for the values I stand for in the big broad Liberal Party? What does that accomplish? It makes it less likely the Liberal Party is going to ever espouse my values. Or do I stay and accept that sometimes I'm going to be on the losing end of the equation — but I still contribute and have meaningful input, and one day, maybe I'll be on the winning side of more decisions.<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

He’s bragged about grabbing women by the you-know-what. He’s in the middle of a court case over paying hush money to a porn star with whom he allegedly cheated on his wife — the third woman he’s married. And he’s the <i>de facto </i>leader of American evangelicalism.</p> <p>How could Christians embrace a leader who has seemingly treated half the “thou shalt nots” in the Bible as a challenge? The typical answer is that it’s a matter of political convenience. Donald Trump may not be a choir boy, the conventional wisdom suggests, but he offers Christians wins on socially conservative policies, and he appointed Supreme Court justices who delivered for evangelicals by overturning <i>Roe v. Wade</i>.</p><p>But anyone who’s so much as set foot in an evangelical church over the last eight years knows that Christians don’t describe Trump as an unfortunate necessity, but a literal God-send. Political convenience alone doesn’t explain that.</p><p>Sex might.</p><p>According to Samuel L. Perry, a sociologist of religion who has written several books on conservative Christianity including <i>Addicted to Lust: Pornography in the Lives of Conservative Protestants, </i>Trump’s sinful behavior may actually reinforce his support among at least some evangelicals.</p><p>Trump’s sexual misdeeds may break religious doctrine, Perry says, but they also affirm his masculinity — at least in the evangelical view. They demonstrate that Trump is a virile, red-blooded man, afflicted by God — like all “real men” — with lust. Not just lust for sex, Perry says, but for power. And much like Biblical warriors who themselves struggled with sexual temptation, Trump can wield that power to lead the faithful to glory.</p><p>In an interview for POLITICO Magazine, Perry spoke about how evangelical ideas about masculinity, pornography and sexuality help explain the most unusual but politically potent alliance in modern politics.</p><p><i>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p><p><b>How do you see evangelical theology and views of masculinity and sexuality impacting support for Trump?</b></p><p>In the Old Testament, you have these examples of flawed but wild and effective warriors for the Lord’s work, who also happen to be womanizers. Of course, you’ve got David, who is somebody who’s celebrated as the leader of Israel, who has his affair with Bathsheba. You’ve got Solomon, who has 1,000 concubines. But then you also have this character of Samson. I actually think Samson is the best metaphor for Trump.</p><p>Samson is just a full-time ass kicker. He’s this rampaging wild man who is like the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/03/31/john-wick-gun-violence-00089665" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715181367169,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-f8ec-dab7-a5ff-fced2e9d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715181367169,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-f8ec-dab7-a5ff-fced2e9d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/03/31/john-wick-gun-violence-00089665&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58c6-daad-a98f-7bcfa3330001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;John Wick&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58c6-daad-a98f-7bcfa3330000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">John Wick</a> of killing Philistines. That’s his favorite thing to do. His other favorite thing to do is to visit prostitutes, and his downfall ends up being this prostitute, Delilah. But that is often glossed over within the evangelical space — he’s still talked about as a hero, because God used him to fight the enemies of his people, and to do it fearlessly and even happily. So there was plenty of precedent in evangelical readings of the Old Testament to celebrate flawed but effective leaders who fail sexually. Maybe they aren’t representative of the best sexual morals, but God used them, and we still celebrate them as heroes.</p><p>Samson is another example, though, of something else. Samson is also thought of as this uber-masculine hero: He’s big, and he’s strong, and the representations of Samson are of this hyper-masculine guy. And part of that is his huge and enormous sexual appetites. The guy was the embodiment of physical superiority, and that includes his sexual superiority as well.</p><p><b>So Samson’s sexual appetites are sinful, but they’re also part of what makes him a strong man. Is sexual temptation seen as a fundamental part of the male evangelical experience?</b></p><p>In my research, I found that evangelicals tend to see sexual temptation as just a normal part of being a Christian man — that God gave men tremendous sexual appetites because he wanted them to be leaders and initiators and people who take charge. And this isn’t just about sexuality; this is about every area of life. This is what’s called <i>complementarianism</i>, that the ultimate male goal is to lead — in terms of politics, is to lead, in terms of moral authority, is to lead, and also in terms of sexual initiation. And that comes with a risk of those appetites being too strong, and somebody being overcome by their own sexual temptation — like a Samson.</p><p>So in Trump, you’ve got this guy who, yes, he has failed sexually. He has a history of being a womanizer. The Stormy Daniels thing is something that reflects poorly on him. And yet, it also reflects positively on his masculinity. Because this guy, he’s a man’s man. This guy is an initiator, he goes after what he wants. He’s going after women, and he now has a supermodel wife who looks like the embodiment of a kind of “trophy wife.” So Trump is representative of a kind of masculinity that is so masculine that his sexual appetites cannot be contained. That’s almost a good sign. In other words, he’s not Mike Pence — a kind of asexual, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/176764/said-it-mike-johnson-ned-flanders" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715181431494,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-f8ec-dab7-a5ff-fced2e9d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715181431494,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-f8ec-dab7-a5ff-fced2e9d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://newrepublic.com/article/176764/said-it-mike-johnson-ned-flanders&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58c7-daad-a98f-7bcf31090001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Ned Flanders kind of Christian&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-58c7-daad-a98f-7bcf31090000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Ned Flanders kind of Christian</a> that is effete and ineffective. No, Trump is power personified. He is a warrior. And with that comes all of the temptations of being a warrior.</p><p><b>What are some ways you see these gendered dynamics playing out in evangelical spaces?</b></p><p>The classic example — and this is such a cliche that we in evangelical spaces often joke about it — but you have the insecure youth pastor who’s getting up in front of the church or getting up in front of his students and says, “Hey, at the back, check out my smokin’ hot wife, Tiffany,” or whatever. And it’s almost inviting you to imagine him having sex with this woman. And that is an example of what I’m talking about, that a Christian man, a leader, would be the one who gets to have sex with hot ladies. And that is a benefit of being the kind of man that God wants you to be.</p><p>One response that we’ve seen in evangelical spaces is the phenomenon of the “tradwife.” So <a href="https://time.com/6962381/tradwives-history/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the tradwife movement&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://time.com/6962381/tradwives-history/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4f30002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4f30003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the tradwife movement</a>, you see social-media influencers embracing this idea of Godly femininity. And they’re going whole hog into this — baking bread and sewing clothes and really leaning into this identity of, “My man is the strong man, and he is the leader of our home. And even though I’m a social media influencer who is now making YouTube videos making money from that, let me just stress that I am a submissive wife and he is the strong, masculine husband who leads our home and our house spiritually.”</p><p>I think this is a response to a perceived loss of masculinity, of the idea that Christian men are no longer viewed as strong warrior-soldiers, that they are people who are passive and nice guys. That’s where you have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Driscoll" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;pastors like Mark Driscoll&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Driscoll&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4f30004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4f30005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">pastors like Mark Driscoll</a>, who was able to find that niche. He looked like a weightlifter. He always talked about how, in his former life as a non-Christian, he would beat people up. And he carried that persona: He was a tough guy, some kind of badass. He wore leather jackets and he cussed all the time. And with that, he was able to put on this persona of, Christians are tough; Christians are wild. Even before Trump, I think Driscoll was actually the example of what would eventually be the kind of masculinity Trump would sell — an untamable, virile leader who is flawed but gets the job done.</p><p><b>What role does pornography play in evangelical communities?</b></p><p>They call it a cancer — that’s a really common word they use for it. And some of them would say it’s the most dangerous threat to the church in history, primarily because of the way it fosters addiction among young people. This is in their words; there’s a lot of debate in the scientific community about the extent to which pornography is addictive. As somebody who’s spent a lot of time researching these things, I’m more inclined to feel that pornography is actually just fuel for a masturbation habit that is developed at young ages — it just carries on, and pornography just happens to be that visual stimulus that people seek out. It’s readily available and convenient. But among evangelicals, pornography use is thought of like heroin: It causes addiction, it ruins people’s lives, it ruins their marriages.</p><p>And yet, at the same time, it is something that is reflective of just being a natural man, being a red-blooded male that God made to initiate sexually. And so if you were to enter into a men’s accountability group or some kind of community group at an evangelical church, and you were to say, “You know what, guys, I don’t really understand where you’re coming from: I’ve never struggled with this temptation. I’ve never looked at porn. I’ve never masturbated. I’ve never been attracted to that at all. And, frankly, y’all are weird.” They would look at you as if you are the weird one. Like, “What is wrong with you? Are you asexual? Are you a closeted homosexual? Like, is this something that you are not attracted to women?” Because it’s such a common part of evangelical male life to struggle and fight against lust and sexual sin.</p><p>In that sense, Trump’s affair with Stormy Daniels makes him relatable. Because the battle with lust is something that every Christian man is supposed to deal with.</p><p>They’re supposed to be pursuing sex; God made them to do that so that they can make more babies — <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/compare/PSA.127.3-5" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;arrows in the warriors’ quiver&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.bible.com/bible/compare/PSA.127.3-5&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4f40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4f40001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">arrows in the warriors’ quiver</a> for the kingdom.</p><p>The flip side of that — when women exercise any kind of sexual agency, they are in fact acting outside of the balance that God created for them. Women are designed to be sexual responders; they’re not supposed to be initiators. One of the things that I found in interviewing so many women for this book, <i>Addicted to Lust</i>, was that when evangelical women struggled with sexual sin — say, watching pornography or masturbating, those kinds of things — they experienced this as a kind of double shame. One of the shames was failing sexually and watching pornography or masturbating. But the other part of it was what is called “sinning against your gender,” which is the idea that, “I’m weird for wanting this, I’m weird for being turned on visually, weird for liking sex and initiating that.”</p><p>So Stormy Daniels and any other women who are involved in these kinds of affairs are usually not given the benefit of the doubt.</p><p><b>How do evangelical leaders and institutions treat women who are cast in this Delilah role?</b></p><p>If you follow the narratives with, say, the <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/investigations/abuse-of-faith/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Southern Baptist sex scandals&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/investigations/abuse-of-faith/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4f40002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4f40003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Southern Baptist sex scandals</a> that have come out within the last few years, often the counter-narrative that I see, at least on social media and among some Christian right journalists, is to ask, “Well, what was the woman’s role in this?” The Christian right is now so partisan, that any of the darlings of the left — like minorities who are harmed in situations of police brutality, or women who are the victims of sexual assault — the first impulse on the Christian right is to say, “Well, what did they do? Did they have it coming? Did they ask for it? Were they initiating this in some way? Are they lying just to get some godly person in trouble? Are they lying to get the cops in trouble, to get a pastor in trouble?” There is an evangelical suspicion, or a Christian right suspicion, of women involved in these kinds of sexual affairs — that they are probably asking for it, probably tempting, probably not helping the situation, certainly not victims.</p><p><b>Whereas the men in this equation just succumbed to temptation and should be defended or redeemed.</b></p><p>Absolutely. In my book, I talk about how the language of addiction is actually a way that evangelical men can let themselves off the hook. Because when you say that I’m addicted, it creates a rhetorical distance between you and the sexual sin itself. It’s not you making conscious decisions every day to look at pornography. What am I supposed to do? I’m addicted.</p><p>It goes even further than this. When you say things like, “I’m enslaved.” That’s a common one. When you say, “I’m enslaved to porn,” or, “I’m enslaved to sexual sin.” You don’t have any agency at that point. It’s involuntary. Like all sin slaves, I’ve been trapped, I’ve been ensnared. It’s like this thing that’s outside of you — the devil or pornography or some temptress or whatever — captured you and dragged you off. And now you’re just a slave to that sexual sin. And it’s a way that you can redeem that sin in a way that sounds more forgivable. This is a common rhetorical move to make a sexual sin that is completely volitional, and very much habitual, conscious and oftentimes very planned out — you can make it seem more, “Oh, it’s kind of accidental.” It’s not something that reflects the character of that person.</p><p><b>Do you think all this has changed evangelicals’ political priorities?</b></p><p>What really matters is the culture war. It’s not family values, unless it’s like anti-LGBTQ values. It’s not being a good neighbor.</p><p>Mike Johnson, the House leader, is kind of a dinosaur when it comes to his representation of what a conservative Christian looks like. Because Johnson, he talks in this traditional Southern Baptist style — a good looking, clean-cut guy who would have been a great pastor back in 1995. He’s an old-school throwback to that kind of language and rhetoric about Christian character and leadership.</p><p>But that’s not what conservative Christianity looks like anymore. Now, conservative Christianity looks like Trump and his supporters. I think that is changing the character of American evangelicalism. Mike Johnson is a thing of the past and really doesn’t exercise any kind of political leadership in evangelical space. What exercises leadership in evangelical space now is the cultural warrior.</p><p><b>Does that emphasis on tough-guy politics and the sense among conservative Christians that they are under threat mean that the standard for religious leaders is lower — we don’t need you to be perfect, just on our side?</b></p><p>It used to be, when I was in college, you had people like <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/22/coronavirus-trump-robert-jeffress-evangelical-supporter-140355" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Robert Jeffress&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/22/coronavirus-trump-robert-jeffress-evangelical-supporter-140355&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4f40004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4f40005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Robert Jeffress</a>, who would have called Catholics and Mormons a cult, and that our number-one task was to try to convert and oppose this kind of influence. And now you’d have those same kinds of religious leaders saying that these are our allies, they’re on the team with us, we’re fighting for family values and freedom and faith and religious liberty. That makes you Christian enough. Trump is an example of that. Could you really nail somebody down and say, hey, Trump never goes to church. Look at the way he talks, look at the way he reacts to people. Has he ever confessed sins? Anything? They would probably say no. But he fights for our values. And honestly, that makes him Christian enough.<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

It marked the 10th time Trump’s comments had officially crossed the line, and Justice Juan Merchan has been fining him $1,000 per violation. Of perhaps more consequence to Trump, Merchan also warned the former and potential future president that he could be sent to jail if he continues to defy the gag order.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine Trump will stop railing against the case on social media and at his campaign rallies, but it’s possible that he can manage just enough impulse control to stay on the right side of the court’s orders going forward.</p><p>Unfortunately for Trump and his lawyers, he has already materially damaged his own legal defense in at least two distinct ways. First, he may have created more evidence that prosecutors might be able to use against him in the case.</p><p>Second, and much more importantly, Trump is increasing the odds that he will have to spend some time in prison if he is convicted and loses his reelection bid.</p><p>The recent statements at issue that Trump has made on social media and in interviews fall into two categories — attacks on witnesses and attacks on the jurors.</p><p>In particular, Trump recently took to Truth Social <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/gag-order-violations-trump-accused-making/story?id=109627332" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;to attack Stormy Daniels&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/US/gag-order-violations-trump-accused-making/story?id=109627332&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4f90004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4f90005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">to attack Stormy Daniels</a>, the adult film star with whom he allegedly had an extramarital sexual relationship.

Merchan concluded that Trump’s lawyers had opened the door to this evidence by attacking the witnesses in their opening statement and said that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/01/nyregion/trump-hush-money-trial-transcript-april-30.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;he would allow the government&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/01/nyregion/trump-hush-money-trial-transcript-april-30.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4f90010&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4f90011&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">he would allow the government</a> to introduce Trump’s comments in order “to explain what I will describe as a lot of back and forth amongst the witnesses” and to “explain that they have not made as much money as the defense would have people think” by turning against Trump.</p><p>The same logic would apply to Trump’s most recent attacks on Cohen and Daniels, which largely fueled the contempt rulings.</p><p>It’s slightly more likely that Trump’s attacks on the jurors themselves might be withheld. Those are so inflammatory that prosecutors — or the judge — might reasonably conclude that they <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/judges/evidence/4-RELEVANCE/4.06_EXCLUSION%20OF%20RELEVANT%20EVIDENCE.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;should be kept&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nycourts.gov/judges/evidence/4-RELEVANCE/4.06_EXCLUSION%20OF%20RELEVANT%20EVIDENCE.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4fa0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4fa0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">should be kept</a> from the jurors so that they can remain focused on the core issues at hand during their deliberations.</p><p>Regardless, prosecutors appear to see the value of using Trump’s own outbursts against him. At the start of the case in mid-April, prosecutors told Merchan that they might introduce some of the statements Trump made that they already believed were in violation of the gag order.</p><p>If they were to do that with Trump’s broadsides since the trial began, the effect could be potent: The jurors would get to see just how inappropriately Trump has been acting outside the courtroom while he has been on trial — and while the jurors, whose lives have been upended and permanently changed by their participation in the case, have been trying to carry out their civic responsibility.</p><p>In a bizarre twist of fate, however, Trump may have been saved by none other than Harvey Weinstein — or, more to the point, the recent decision from New York’s highest court that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/25/alvin-bragg-harvey-weinstein-00154418" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;threw out Weinstein’s 2020 conviction&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/25/alvin-bragg-harvey-weinstein-00154418&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4fa0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4fa0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">threw out Weinstein’s 2020 conviction</a> on sex crimes. The court concluded that prosecutors in the Manhattan D.A.’s office had improperly introduced irrelevant and unduly prejudicial testimony about alleged sexual assaults by Weinstein that were distinct from those directly charged in the case.</p><p>The jury has so far been shielded from Trump’s contempt proceedings. Particularly given the Weinstein ruling, prosecutors are now likely to be wary of a higher court later concluding that the judge inadvertently let the government back-door the contempt finding in this way when it otherwise would not have been admissible.<br /></p><br /><p><b>The much bigger problem</b> for Trump, however, is that he is materially increasing the odds that he will be sent to prison if he is convicted at the end of the trial.</p><p>Since the start of this case, many observers — myself very much included — have questioned whether Trump would serve any sort of prison sentence if he is convicted at the close of the case.

But it is an interesting window into the Washington industry of pre-campaign memoirs — where the goal of defining a brand is often at odds with the goal of producing interesting copy, and where nobody puts a great deal of emphasis on quality control or literary drama.</p><p>Even within the grandiose political-memoir category, the rising-national-candidate subgenre historically stood out in its formulaic dullness. A big shot at the end of a career can at least describe being in the room when important things happened, or use a book to settle scores with folks readers might actually have heard of. A governor trying to establish a national footprint doesn’t have that kind of material to work with.</p><p>Which means that the tomes have typically been paint-by-numbers affairs in which a ghostwriter tries to spin some log-cabin yarns from the pol’s childhood, dramatize otherwise obscure old clashes over local political issues, and maybe toss in a nod to the noble responsibility that came with commanding their state’s National Guard.</p><p>“It was their calling card,” said Larry Weissman, a New York-based literary agent who sells lots of political books and was involved with then-Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper’s (actually well-reviewed) 2016 memoir. “It gave them an excuse to do more media and tour around the country. But they always play it incredibly safe and so they’re boring AF. And so nobody really reads them.”</p><p>But just because they’re not usually meant to be read doesn’t mean they’re not meant to be purchased. Especially now, in an age when the line between cable-TV political provocateur and actual elected official has blurred, a book by a telegenic rising political star might sell for the same reason as a book by a talking-head figure like Mark Levin: People buy it as a sort of tribal emblem for their politics.</p><p>Noem’s first book is a case in point: It sold 100,000 copies across all formats and made the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list, an easy win for its publisher. “The industry doesn’t think much of these books but they may make easy money for a publisher,” is how one top agent put it to me, speaking anonymously, perhaps because the agency would like to keep working in this line of business.</p><p>Thanks to the economics of book publishing — where a single smash hit balances out a string of mediocre sellers — publishers also know that there’s always a chance that the vicissitudes of politics could lead to gold even with mediocre sellers: Consider the memoir by the unknown Harvard Law School graduate Barack Obama, which became a bestseller years later when the future president’s star rose.</p><p>But for every book like that, there are volumes by supposedly can’t-miss candidates like Marco Rubio that disappear along with the politician’s fortunes.</p><p>Now the second Noem book is unintentionally highlighting that often-overlooked other factor in campaign books: Quality control.</p><p>Ordinarily, few of the players have much motivation to care about excellence. For the publisher, it’s the politician’s name that’s going to make a book sell or flop. For an ambitious pol trying to build a brand, repeating political nostrums often seems a better way to do so than pushing the literary envelope.</p><p>It doesn’t help that the pols’ production process can be hasty — and facilitated by loyalists. “They will often be crashed, so they come in late, and then they’re edited quickly,” said Weissman.</p><p>“There is this tendency among politicians to hire staffers or somebody who maybe doesn’t have the wherewithal or stature to be able to push back and say, hey, the story you want to tell isn’t imparting the point that you want to make,” said Keith Urbahn of the Beltway literary agency Javelin, which has sold scores of political memoirs from pols ranging from Adam Schiff to Ted Cruz. (Javelin also represented Noem on her first book, though they declined comment on the behind-the-scenes processes for any specific authors.)</p><p>The campaign-book genre is so widely mocked that even its most convincing defense involves a calculus more interesting to journalists than to regular people who just want to curl up with a good book: The longtime book critic Carlos Lozada, whose recent collection, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Washington-Book-Read-Politics-Politicians/dp/1668050730/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Py230-XRa3B2Nt5O8UNQtPNpFaEKknUaWpPNrexVGuRQP2QWRHPgH2y32N7s4OOFWGp0-So9cGyxfkQp8xcOsw.t5Z0syg3e5PdKXReHkhTIepcYX8TIJVVypfC4gPUdBI&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_-GxBhC1ARIsADGgDjsmBW0BDt4ZfPEeW50yzcfjHbuTkJREo-9EtDKHrR_46iA58yKqgPMaAgzpEALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=692760139675&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1027027&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=3188828545569043181&amp;hvtargid=kwd-2472808083112&amp;hydadcr=15334_13517973&amp;keywords=carlos+lozada+the+washington+book&amp;qid=1715005058&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;i>The Washington Book&lt;/i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Washington-Book-Read-Politics-Politicians/dp/1668050730/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Py230-XRa3B2Nt5O8UNQtPNpFaEKknUaWpPNrexVGuRQP2QWRHPgH2y32N7s4OOFWGp0-So9cGyxfkQp8xcOsw.t5Z0syg3e5PdKXReHkhTIepcYX8TIJVVypfC4gPUdBI&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_-GxBhC1ARIsADGgDjsmBW0BDt4ZfPEeW50yzcfjHbuTkJREo-9EtDKHrR_46iA58yKqgPMaAgzpEALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=692760139675&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1027027&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=3188828545569043181&amp;hvtargid=kwd-2472808083112&amp;hydadcr=15334_13517973&amp;keywords=carlos+lozada+the+washington+book&amp;qid=1715005058&amp;sr=8-1&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4ff0012&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee4ff0013&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>The Washington Book</i></a><i>,</i> is all about Beltway lit, has argued that campaign books are a place pols tell on themselves by the way they shade things or position stories. But that requires a kind of delving between the lines that for most civilians is different from actually reading for pleasure.</p><p>Noem’s new book — which doesn’t officially publish until May 7 — meets that standard: Whatever you think of putting down a dog for attacking a neighbor’s chickens, the decision to keep the story in the book also seems to show a political culture so devoted to shocking establishment nostrums that it fails to recognize how loving dogs is a pretty mainstream piece of American culture.

Newspapers and magazines stand behind the things they put out, but in book-publishing, the veracity of a work is entirely on the writer.</p><p>Javelin’s principals told me they thought the embarrassing round of publicity around Noem’s new book might be a reminder that quality actually matters, whether the goal is selling books or selling a candidacy. “You can’t fake being a bestseller for weeks,” Urbahn said.</p><p>“Somebody who has a big platform can get on TV the week their book comes out and sell a certain number of copies,” said Matt Latimer, who runs the agency with Urbahn. “But if your book isn’t any good content, or there are all kinds of errors in it, you don’t have that tail — and what you really want, and what a publisher wants, is a book by someone prominent that lasts more than a week.

It causes some people to subscribe and others to cancel their subscriptions, and gives journalists the necessary courage and direction to do their best work. Swagger was once journalism’s calling card, but in recent decades it’s been sidelined. In some venues, reporters now do their work with all the passion of an accountant, and it shows in their guarded, couched and equivocating copy. Instead of relishing controversy, today’s newsrooms shy away from publishing true stories that someone might claim cause “harm” — that modern term that covers all emotional distress — or even worse, which could offend powerful interests.</p><p>Every aging generation of journalists must have complained, at one point or another, about swagger’s demise. But this time, the fall is demonstrable. A recent <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/03/17/2024/very-few-have-balls-how-american-news-lost-its-nerve" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;piece by Max Tani in &lt;i>Semafor&lt;/i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.semafor.com/article/03/17/2024/very-few-have-balls-how-american-news-lost-its-nerve&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee50a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee50a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">piece by Max Tani in <i>Semafor</i></a> attributed the new timidity to legal threats from subjects of news stories. “In 2024, it’s harder than ever to get a tough story out in the United States of America,” Tani writes, citing the risk of lawsuits and increased insurance premiums. The new equation “has given public figures growing leverage over the journalists who now increasingly carry their water.” Tani cited several examples of publications backing down, including <i>Esquire </i>and the <i>Hollywood Reporter </i>backing off from a critical story about podcaster Jay Shetty, the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/01/19/india-judge-reuters-story-00136339" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;surrender by Reuters&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/01/19/india-judge-reuters-story-00136339&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee50a0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee50a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">surrender by Reuters</a> and other outlets to India’s legal demands about an exposé, and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/03/05/formula-one-road-track-kate-wagner/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;unpublishing of a biting Formula 1 story&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/03/05/formula-one-road-track-kate-wagner/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee50a0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee50a0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">unpublishing of a biting Formula 1 story</a> in Hearst’s <i>Road &amp; Track</i>.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/e0/e3/20db4177419ebcea2310543c03ae/pentagon-papers-82516.jpg" /><br /><p>Perhaps the clearest marker of swagger going AWOL is the fact that nobody has risen to replace the late Christopher Hitchens on the lecture circuit, on cable news, in books and in the pages of our best publications. If he were resurrected today, who would hire him? And if they did, how long would it take for the staff to petition the bosses to fire him?</p><p>The loss of journalistic swagger can be measured partly in numbers. A generation ago, the profession summoned cultural power from employing almost a <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2016/employment-trends-in-newspaper-publishing-and-other-media-1990-2016.htm" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;half-million people&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2016/employment-trends-in-newspaper-publishing-and-other-media-1990-2016.htm&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee50a0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee50a0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">half-million people</a> in the newspaper business alone.

The psychological approach journalists bring to their jobs has shifted. At one time, big city newspaper editors typified by the <i>Washington Post</i>’s Ben Bradlee strode their properties like colossuses, barking orders and winning deference from all corners. Today’s newspaper editor comes clothed in the drab and accommodating aura of a bureaucrat, often indistinguishable from the publishers for whom they work. These top editors, who once ruled their staffs with tyrannical confidence, now flinch and cringe at the prospect of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/28/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc-newsroom-power-shift-00149408" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;newsroom uprisings&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/28/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc-newsroom-power-shift-00149408&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee50a000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee50a000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">newsroom uprisings</a> like the ones we’ve seen at NBC News, the<i> New York Times</i>, CNN and elsewhere. You could call these uprisings markers of swagger, but you’d be wrong. True swagger is found in works of journalism, not protests over hirings or the publication of a controversial piece.</p><p>Treading softly so as not to rile anybody, these editors impose that style on their journalists, many of whom do their work in a defensive crouch instead of the traditional offensive stance. Often throttled by their top editors, today’s journalists also find themselves fighting a second front against politicians who now direct their campaigns at reporters as much as they do their opponents. The public appears to hate them too, according to polls that claim they’re <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/512861/media-confidence-matches-2016-record-low.aspx" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;not trustworthy&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/512861/media-confidence-matches-2016-record-low.aspx&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee50a0010&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee50a0011&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">not trustworthy</a>.

The press has become no weakling. Obviously, good work is still done but with blunted rather than sharpened teeth compared with previous decades. Nor will the craft vaporize upon some near future event horizon. But like its other sister institutions of influence — Hollywood, religion, the novel, the courts, public schools, et al. — it no longer strides with its former confidence. Ask any journalist about their depleted esprit de corps and you will hear a litany of lamentations.<br /></p><br /><p>Swagger should not be mistaken for shouting and galumphing in the newsroom or for its cousin, gonzo journalism, invented by <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas </i>author Hunter S. Thompson and imitated by so many lesser writers for the last five decades.

Now, the press’ status as a pacesetter and respected authority has evaporated, and journalists know it.</p><p>As readers look away, it’s led to the primary cause of journalism’s decline: lack of advertising.

Journalists don’t need to consult the latest round of layoffs at their outlets to understand they’ve lost prestige in the culture, or to see that acquaintances with similar educations out-earn them.</p><p>“Journalism’s imperiled economic basis reduces the total number of jobs available and creates less-than-ideal work conditions,” Powers and Vera-Zambrano write. It’s not uncommon for a barrage of layoffs to be followed by demands by bosses that reporters and editors do more with less. Meanwhile, new information ecosystems “have loosened journalism’s monopoly on the production and distribution of legitimate information and erode[d] the sense of importance that stemmed from that exclusivity.”</p><p>Nobody ever became a journalist in order to become popular. The broad-stroke portrayals in movies and novels taught us, accurately enough, that journalists tend toward the coarse, vulgar, impudent and nosy. For many years, journalists were generally admired for those attributes in the way that the beef butcher is admired for the scars on his hands.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/92/b9/d89a20c44f809e1a6c1aa1be971e/end-of-gawker-biggest-moments.JPEG" /><br /><p>But thanks, in part, to a fall in status, as well as ever-irrational attacks from politicians like Donald Trump, today’s journalists routinely experience ridicule and harassment at public events like rallies and demonstrations. They’re not precisely pariahs in the new environment, but they’re no longer considered heroes in many places. Journalists don’t deserve any special pity, it should be noted. Police officers, teachers and even doctors often suffer more from the slings and arrows of the mob. But for journalists, the fall has been spectacular and seems never-ending.</p><p>Hanging over journalism like a gibbous moon is Terry “Hulk Hogan” Bollea’s successful lawsuit against <i>Gawker</i>, financed by the billionaire Peter Thiel, which Tani notes in his <i>Semafor</i> piece. Thiel’s successful action, which forced the site to shutter in 2016, has journalists everywhere looking over their shoulders in worry. In the new climate, law firms have built practices devoted to blocking the publication of tough-minded stories with formal legal warnings.</p><p>Perfectly fine publications do exist, and they deserve our support. For instance, there’s the <i>Atlantic</i>, which couldn’t win more National Magazine Awards if the contest were fixed. With stalwart writers like Caitlin Flanagan and Mark Leibovich, the magazine shows it can go full bravado when it wants to. But what’s its excuse for not breaking more icons? Too often, our media seems like it was produced to be consumed by our parents, most of whom are dead.</p><p><i>Reason</i> magazine’s Nick Gillespie blames the decline of swagger, in part, to generational forces.</p><p>“Millennials and Gen Z have been bred like human veal by their Boomer and Gen X parents who made sure their kids were constantly being surveilled and optimized for success in SATs, sports and entry into the Establishment pipeline,” he says. “Can we be surprised that such a system has produced generations of journalists who endlessly describe anything they disagree with as misinformation and want to control and regulate everything like the room temperature in an after-school enrichment program?”</p><p>This attitude has permeated the press, as editors recoil from publishing anything that might cause anyone offense.</p><h3 style="text-align: center"></h3><h3 style="text-align: center">The Pipeline Runs Dry</h3><p>For the next generation, the future is dismal.

Elsewhere on the media horizon, we catch the sniff of swagger at outlets like Punchbowl News, the Ankler, Tablet, the Ringer, County Highway and 404 Media, to name a few, where challenging readers instead of coddling them comes first. If Substack has proved there’s an ample supply of readers willing to be challenged by bracing copy, perhaps editors will be willing to unleash the storehouses of repressed swagger in their newsrooms to feed the need. On the other hand, it could be that the fall of citadels of swagger like Buzzfeed News, the relaunched Gawker <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/4484059-vice-stop-publishing-website-lay-off-hundreds/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1714756363481,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-86a8-d221-a5c5-a6aaa8970005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1714756363481,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-86a8-d221-a5c5-a6aaa8970005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/media/4484059-vice-stop-publishing-website-lay-off-hundreds/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-3f71-de5e-a19f-ff779d1e0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;and Vice&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-3f71-de5e-a19f-ff779d1e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">and Vice</a> portend doom for swagger’s future.</p><p>Sometimes the emergence of a single new publication can alter the journalistic current. <i>Spy </i>magazine, founded in 1986 by Kurt Andersen and Graydon Carter, struck the journalism world <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMMbaG6sm_Y" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;like the Chicxulub asteroid&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMMbaG6sm_Y&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee50e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee50e0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">like the Chicxulub asteroid</a>. <i>Spy </i>brought equal measures of swagger, moxie, attitude, gumption and pinpoint reporting to magazine and newspaper journalism. Louis Rossetto’s <i>Wired </i>magazine, launched in 1993, did some of the same. Perhaps swagger’s resurrection will come in the form of a new publication or website that tosses off the zip-ties for freer expression.</p><p>Chapman, for one, doubts that the industry’s swagger will return any time soon.</p><p>“Journalism is so fragmented, and readers, viewers and profits so much harder to come by, that journalists have to be more careful with their audiences,” he says. “In some ways, journalism is better than it used to be, with higher standards of writing, ethics, accountability and analysis. Journalists are generally more respectful of and sensitive to groups that once got ignored or disparaged. I don’t want to go back to the old days. But we have lost some qualities that made journalism entertaining.”</p><p>If journalism is to regain the kingdom, it will need to call on top editors to lead the restoration with brass and daring. The same goes for the owners who shriek at the possibility of lawsuits. As former <i>Vanity Fair </i>and <i>New Yorker </i>editor Tina Brown put it to Tani, “Very few owners have balls anymore.” That’s true, but journalistic history show us they can be grown.</p><p>Like fighter pilots, journalists must be well-trained and confident but without being cowboys. Meekness produces journalism as gray as dishwater and no more tasty. If journalism is ever to regain its former — and rightful — status, it must first regain its swagger.</p><p>******</p><p><i>No, Fox News does not swagger.

Less than 17 percent of the money Congress approved has been spent so far.</h2><p><b>What we found:</b> Out of more than $1.6 trillion these laws provided for climate, infrastructure and energy, roughly $1.1 trillion was to be direct spending — largely in the form of grants, loans and contracts.</p><p>But it’s taken a while to get the dollars moving.</p><p>For the infrastructure, pandemic and CHIPS laws, agencies have formally awarded $242 billion to date, meaning the federal government has committed to pay out this sum. For the IRA, the government has announced roughly $60 billion in potential funding.</p><p>The amount that agencies have actually spent is even smaller, between $125 billion and $186 billion, according to POLITICO’s review of federal data. That number is a broad range because no public resource offers a full accounting of formal awards or spending under the IRA. As a result, we’ve included the full scope of funding announced under the IRA in our estimate in order to reflect the maximum amount of spending that could have taken place.</p><p><b>Why this matters: </b>The administration isn’t legally required to spend this money in Biden’s first term — and some of the infrastructure cash can’t legally be spent until next year or later. Biden White House officials predict a continued surge of formal commitments through at least January.</p><p>But the fact that only a relatively small percentage of the overall investment has been spent means the real-world effects may not yet have touched some parts of the country, including key voters in the election.<br /></p><br /><h2 style="text-align: left">2. Look beyond Biden's big announcements</h2><p><b>What we found:</b> The administration prefers to focus on a very big number — the amount of money agencies have announced they will provide to recipients under one or more of the laws.</p><p>These multibillion-dollar announcements have become a routine staple of the Biden era, often featuring a public appearance by the president or a member of his Cabinet. As of April, the announcements have totaled more than $543 billion, or half of the full value of what Congress appropriated.</p><p>Private companies, including those hoping for a share of the new grants, loans or tax breaks, have followed through with their own announcements. Those have totaled more than $866 billion in planned investments for industries such as advanced chips, electric vehicles and clean energy manufacturing.</p><p>But an announcement doesn’t necessarily mean the money will flow quickly — or that the announced recipient will ever see it. Agencies typically announce tentative awards after identifying a recipient and a funding amount, but the awards could still be under negotiation, and either side might back out.</p><p>Similarly, changing market conditions or worries about federal policy have prompted some companies to cancel or delay major electric vehicle, battery, solar and wind projects.</p><p><b>Why this matters:</b> Funding announcements can show that agencies are pushing to make progress on Biden’s agenda. Many published analyses of the administration’s policies have focused at least partly on the announcements. But the big-dollar proclamations may give an inflated picture of the impact that Biden’s policies are having so far.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">3. Spending over $1 trillion is a lot of work</h2><p><b>What we found: </b>There are several explanations for the gap between announced and actual spending.</p><p>For one, negotiations for this money can take time, with the federal government sometimes awarding money weeks or months after it makes the announcement. State governments and other recipients also have significant leeway to decide where the money goes — or even how quickly Washington can put it out. For instance, states that want federal funding for electric vehicle chargers must first compile plans for using the money. For large-scale infrastructure projects, recipients typically have to do the work before Washington reimburses them. That lengthy process can take years.</p><p>And not all announcements necessarily lead to the intended recipient getting the cash. For instance, the Energy Department announced it had selected a Texas-based company for a $200 million grant to support a battery project in Tennessee, only to withdraw the award last spring. DOE didn’t offer a specific explanation, but the company had drawn criticism from Republican lawmakers because of ties to China.</p><p>Another company told POLITICO that a behind-schedule environmental review is holding up the money that the federal government awarded it.</p><p><b>Why this matters: </b>The administration stresses — and our data shows — that it has made progress moving the money forward. But federal money comes with a lot of strings that frustrate some would-be recipients.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">4. Would these efforts survive Trump?</h2><p><b>What we found: </b>Trump has lambasted Biden’s green energy programs and <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-using-impoundment-to-cut-waste-stop-inflation-and-crush-the-deep-state" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;called for “impounding”&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-using-impoundment-to-cut-waste-stop-inflation-and-crush-the-deep-state&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee5180000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee5180001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">called for “impounding”</a> congressionally approved spending he considers wasteful. He has been especially critical of the climate law and attacked Republican lawmakers who voted for the infrastructure law.</p><p>That increases the urgency for the Biden administration to implement the money effectively and quickly.</p><p><b>Why this matters: </b>A Trump victory would create massive uncertainty for whatever federal dollars remain un-obligated. He could halt or slow the remaining grant approvals and applications, and a Trump Treasury Department could revise stalled rules for clean energy tax credits to restrict access. And he could shift the speed and focus for the Energy Department’s approximately $200 billion in remaining energy loan authority — a program he proposed abolishing when he was president.</p><p>Read <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2024/biden-trillion-dollar-spending-tracker" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1715091457112,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000187-1473-d989-a7a7-bfffa9da0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1715091457112,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000187-1473-d989-a7a7-bfffa9da0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/interactives/2024/biden-trillion-dollar-spending-tracker&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5032-daad-a98f-7b3f4a150001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the full story here&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-5032-daad-a98f-7b3f4a150000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the full story here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The poll found greater awareness of the Inflation Reduction Act, but still only 17 percent said they’ve heard “a lot” about it, and 35 percent said they’d heard “some” about it.</p><p>Of the four, the CHIPS and Science Act has the lowest profile. Only 9 percent of respondents said they’d heard “a lot” about it, while another 23 percent said they’d heard “some.”</p><p>Voters with higher incomes and higher levels of educational attainment tended to be slightly more likely to say they had heard about the laws.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">2. There’s a clear partisan divide over the laws</h2><br /><p>The greatest divide in the survey data falls along party lines. Self-identified Democrats are more likely to say they have seen, read or heard about the laws than Republicans or independents — and are far more likely to see them as personally beneficial or helping their communities.</p><p>For example, 37 percent of Democratic voters said the Inflation Reduction Act has impacted them positively, compared with only 12 percent of Republicans and 15 percent of independents. And 44 percent of Democrats said the bipartisan infrastructure law has positively impacted their community — far more than the 15 percent of Republicans and 23 percent of independents who agreed.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">3. Voters say they don’t see the benefits</h2><br /><p>The poll also suggests another problem for Biden: Broadly speaking, few voters say they’re seeing the federal government’s efforts to revitalize the nation’s infrastructure or build up a clean energy sector.</p><p>Only a quarter of voters, 25 percent, said “the clean energy and infrastructure projects approved since 2021” had increased jobs in their community. Thirty percent said they’ve had no impact, and another 28 percent didn’t know or had no opinion.</p><p>For the four specific laws tested — even when restricted to poll respondents who said they’d heard something about them — only around 25 percent said they had positively impacted them personally.</p><p>Asked about the combined impact of federal spending on infrastructure in their community since Biden became president, 26 percent said it had a “major impact,” another 26 percent said it had a “minor impact” and 30 percent said it had “no impact.” Eighteen percent of respondents had no opinion.</p><p>Biden can keep trying to champion infrastructure during the course of the campaign, but voters aren’t praising it right now.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">4. Many voters credit Trump, not Biden, for doing more on infrastructure</h2><br /><p>Many voters aren’t giving Biden credit when they do see positive benefits.</p><p>When he signed the infrastructure bill into law in 2021, Biden famously succeeded where Trump had failed. But asked who has done more to promote infrastructure improvements and job creation, nearly as many voters said Trump (37 percent) as Biden (40 percent). Twelve percent said they’ve both done about the same, and another 12 percent had no opinion.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, party identification is the key driver on this question. About three-in-four Democrats, 74 percent, said Biden has done more to promote infrastructure improvements and jobs — but an almost identical number of Republicans, 70 percent, said it’s Trump who’s done more. Among independents, roughly the same number picked Biden (34 percent) and Trump (32 percent).</p><p>Biden also has a slight edge among voters in the presidential battleground states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — leading Trump on the question of who gets more credit, 42 percent to 36 percent.</p><p>The Biden campaign’s most-aired TV ad seeks to make this point specifically: “For four years, Donald Trump tried to pass an infrastructure law — and he failed,” Biden says in the spot, which has been backed by $4.6 million in spending, according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political advertising. “I got it done. Now we’re rebuilding America.”</p><p>But on virtually every question about the spending bills — including whether Biden or Trump gets more credit — the poll numbers among respondents in electoral swing states did not meaningfully differ from the overall results. Some voters give him credit for the benefits they see — but nearly as many voters credit Trump instead.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Wade</i> nearly two years ago created a patchwork — and ever changing — landscape of abortion access in the United States, with roughly a third of states prohibiting the procedure in nearly all circumstances. That includes almost all of the southeastern United States, after a recent Florida Supreme Court ruling triggered a six-week abortion ban in the state that will take effect May 1 and cut off a key regional access point for the procedure.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a 160-year old aw outlawing abortions at any stage of pregnancy unless the patient’s life is in danger, with no exceptions for rape or incest. That decision could take effect as early as the end of May, though it is unclear how, whether and when the law will be enforced.</p><p>And ongoing litigation in other states, such as Nebraska, Iowa and Utah, could mean more changes to state abortion laws this year.</p><p>Abortion-rights groups are also pushing this year to pass constitutional amendments that would protect abortion access in states like Montana and Nevada and overturn abortion bans in Florida and Missouri.</p><p>Explore the map and table below for more on each state’s abortion laws:<br /></p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Every week political cartoonists throughout the country and across the political spectrum apply their ink-stained skills to capture the foibles, memes, hypocrisies and other head-slapping events in the world of politics. The fruits of these labors are hundreds of cartoons that entertain and enrage readers of all political stripes. Here's an offering of the best of this week's crop, picked fresh off the Toonosphere. Edited by Matt Wuerker.</description>

He shook his head at times. His anger was so visible and distracting that the judge asked his lawyers to tell him to cool off.</p><p>But for all the eye-popping stories about their alleged tryst — which Trump has denied — the former president and his allies believe it will do little to dent him in the court of public opinion. Privately, they acknowledge that while Daniels’ details have been embarrassing, Trump’s messy personal affairs and love life have been tabloid fodder for decades.</p><p>“I think most Republicans — even ones who dislike him — recognize this as a complete and total B.S. trial in a kangaroo court that should’ve never been brought,” said Republican strategist Scott Jennings.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352606317112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Trump is under a gag order that prevents him from publicly commenting on jurors, witnesses or other people involved in the case, so he has leaned on surrogates and allies to spread his message. <a href="https://x.com/EricTrump/status/1787870712876671379" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;On X, Trump’s son, Eric&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/EricTrump/status/1787870712876671379&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee5300000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee5300001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">On X, Trump’s son, Eric</a>, who previously showed up in the New York courtroom, questioned the relevance of Daniels’ salacious details.

To hear lies and disloyalty from whoever it is, that is a tough scenario for him,” said a Republican strategist close to the Trump campaign who was granted anonymity to speak freely.</p><p>And then there is the question of how the trial will impact Trump with voters. While a recent PBS <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/poll-majority-of-americans-arent-paying-attention-to-trumps-hush-money-trial" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/poll-majority-of-americans-arent-paying-attention-to-trumps-hush-money-trial&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee530000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee530000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll</a> found that 55 percent of Americans said they were not following the trial much or at all, Daniels’ testimony could hurt him with female voters, according to Jennifer Horn, the former chair of the New Hampshire GOP and a co-founded of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group.</p><p>“Her testimony makes [clear] what we already know about Trump — essentially that he's a sleazy, narcissistic, cheater,” said Horn, who said Daniels’ testimony was specific and detailed, lending her credibility. “Did she sound angry? Was she eager to see him held accountable? Yes, of course ... she speaks of experiences and fears that most women can relate to.”</p><p>As Daniels was on the stand, Trump had to sit silently and listen as she revealed a series of embarrassing details about her alleged sexual encounter with him. The case centers on accusations that the former president falsified business records to hide a $130,000 payment to Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. It’s one of four separate criminal cases Trump is facing. </p><p>The warning from the judge on Tuesday — that his audible cursing and head shaking was “contemptuous” — appeared to work. On Thursday, as Trump watched the cross examination, he was less visibly animated as his defense team was determined to put Daniels on her heels and try to paint her as inconsistent and greedy for fame and money.</p><p>“Your story has completely changed, hasn’t it?” Susan Necheles, an attorney for Trump, asked Daniels.</p><p>“No, not at all. You’re trying to make me say it’s changed but it hasn’t changed,” Daniels said.</p><p>Trump’s team pointed to moments where Daniels claimed Trump was wearing different clothing, whether or not they had dinner, or whether or not she “blacked out” during the encounter.</p><p>But Daniels also pushed back as Trump’s defense team cross examined Daniels for the second time in the New York trial.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352468420112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Necheles noted Daniels has an online store where she sells merchandise, like a $40 “Saint of Indictments” candle, which shows her draped like Christ and with a halo, and described it as “shilling.”</p><p>“Not unlike Mr. Trump,” Daniels said in reply. The former president recently hawked Bibles online and has sold steaks, hats and silk ties on his own website. She added that there were times she did not receive compensation for the publicity around her allegations, including a “60 Minutes” interview.</p><p>At the end of the day, Trump attorney Todd Blanche asked Justice Juan Merchan to declare a mistrial again in light of Daniels’ testimony. They also asked if Trump could publicly respond to Daniels’ testimony despite the gag order. The former president is scheduled to hold a rally in New Jersey on Saturday. </p><p>“He needs an opportunity to respond to the American people and the reasons for the gag order as it relates to Ms. Daniels is over. She’s no longer a witness,” Blanche said.</p><p>Prosecutors argued that allowing Trump to go after Daniels would have a chilling effect on future witnesses.</p><p>But Merchan bluntly <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/09/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/judge-dresses-down-trumps-lawyers-00157187" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;criticized Trump’s attorneys' overall strategy and their failure to object&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/09/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/judge-dresses-down-trumps-lawyers-00157187&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee530000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee530000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">criticized Trump’s attorneys' overall strategy and their failure to object</a> at key moments during Daniels’ testimony.</p><p>“For the life of me, I don’t know why Ms. Necheles didn’t object,” Merchan said. He also questioned why Trump’s team kept going back over questions about consent.</p><p>“I don’t know why you went into it ad nauseam on cross-examination,” the judge said. “You drummed it over and over again into the jury’s ears. I don’t understand the reason for that.”</p><p>He ruled against the Trump team’s motion for a mistrial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Trump’s defense team presented a much less flattering picture of her as an extortionist and liar eager to cash in on an unlikely brush with fame.</p><p>Officially, the audience for the tense exchanges that sometimes approached shouting was the jury of seven men and five women seated in the shabby, 15th-floor courtroom in lower Manhattan. But the packed gallery, the intense security and the TV trucks outside were all reminders that Trump’s potential political liability in the case is at least as significant as his legal exposure.</p><p>For about three hours, prosecutor Susan Hoffinger sought to convince the jury — and the broader audience — that Daniels is far more than the image conjured by tabloid headlines.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352468420112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Hoffinger met the formidable challenge of trying to render a porn star relatable by stressing her protectiveness of her daughter, her work on movies and music videos outside the pornography industry, the three books she has written and even a flirtation with a 2009 Senate candidacy in Louisiana.</p><p>Daniels bluntly described her entry into the adult entertainment industry as an exotic dancer at age 17 as a simple question of dollars and cents. “I could still make more in two nights than I did shoveling manure eight hours a day,” she said, a reference to how she toiled on a horse farm.</p><p>It took only about 15 minutes before Daniels was asked to address the elephant in the room: her encounter with Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, where she claims she had sex with him in 2006. She said she knew little about him at the time, except that he had a TV show she had never seen.</p><p>Daniels said the celebrity golfers met her and several other porn stars from the same studio at a photo line at the event. Upon hearing that she’d directed some films, Trump was quick to comment on her intellect, she said.</p><p>“You direct, too? You must be the smart one,” Daniels recalled Trump saying at their first brief meeting. After another brief encounter where he again called her “smart,” Daniels said she heard from Trump’s then-bodyguard that the real estate mogul wanted to meet her for dinner.</p><p>With that, Hoffinger triggered one of the more dramatic moments of the day by asking Daniels: “Do you see Mr. Trump in the courtroom today?” Daniels, whose line of sight to Trump was blocked by the judge’s bench, craned her neck around it and pointed at the former president.</p><p>“Navy blue jacket at the table,” Daniels said.</p><p>Trump remained stone-faced and did not look in her direction.</p><p>Daniels went on to give a meticulously detailed account of how she wound up in Trump’s hotel suite that night, describing the “black-and-white tile floors” and a table decorated with flowers near the door. “This hotel room was three times the size of my apartment,” she declared, drawing a smile from one of the female jurors.</p><p>Daniels said she was expecting to go to a restaurant in the hotel, but got the sense Trump might have other intentions when he made his appearance wearing pajamas.</p><p>“I told him to go change. So, he obliged very politely,” Daniels said. Her account of the evening was buttressed by the fact that it was not entirely critical of Trump. While he spent a lot of time talking about himself and often interrupted her, she lauded him for asking about details of the adult film business beyond the on-screen sex, like labor unions, health insurance and screening for sexually transmitted infections.</p><p>“He was very interested in a lot of the business aspects of it, which I thought was very cool,” Daniels said, adding that Trump also raised with her the possibility of featuring her on his TV show, “The Apprentice.”</p><p>Daniels said at one point she inquired about his wife, Melania, to which Trump replied: “We actually don’t sleep in the same room.” Daniels mouthed the word “Wow” to the jury after relaying that alleged comment.</p><p>Daniels said that when he took out a magazine cover with his picture on it, she dressed him down. “Are you always this rude?” she said she told him, before whacking him with the magazine. “I took it from him and I swatted him with it … right on the butt,” she said.</p><p>As Daniels recounted that story, Trump appeared to mutter the word “bullshit” under his breath, while still not looking in Daniels’ direction, although her image was on TV screens in front of him. That earned Trump a warning from the judge during a sidebar with attorneys.</p><p>“I understand that your client is upset at this point, but he is cursing audibly, and he is shaking his head visually and that's contemptuous. It has the potential to intimidate the witness and the jury can see that,” Merchan said, according to a transcript released later. “You need to speak to him. I won't tolerate that.” Blanche said later he conveyed the message to the former president.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6352362261112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Trump and his attorneys appeared to grow particularly irritated as Daniels recounted the alleged sexual encounter itself, which she said occurred after she returned from a trip to the bathroom and found Trump sitting on a bed wearing just boxer shorts and a T-shirt.</p><p>“At first, I was just startled. I wasn’t expecting to see him there, especially minus a lot of clothes. I had that moment where I felt the room spun in slow motion. I felt the blood leave my hands and my feet like you do if you stand up too fast. I was just like, ‘What did I misread to get here?’” Daniels said.</p><p>Daniels said she tried to leave and the ensuing events were a blur but led to the two of them having sex on the bed.</p><p>“I never said I was drugged. I was not drunk,” Daniels said during an exchange that triggered a flurry of objections from Trump’s lawyers. “There was an imbalance of power, for sure. He was bigger and blocking the way, but I was not threatened either verbally or physically.”</p><p>“The next thing I know is I was on the bed,” Daniels said. “I had my clothes and my shoes off. I believe my bra was still on. We were in missionary position.”</p><p>That level of detail appeared to make some jurors uncomfortable, with one turning away and holding her head with her hand. Merchan also sustained an objection and asked that some of Daniels’ comments be stricken from the record.</p><p>The vivid testimony was a dramatic change in tone from the day before, when prosecutors spent most of the day <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/06/trump-hush-money-trial-paper-trail-checks-00156408" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;meticulously showing jurors bank and accounting records&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/06/trump-hush-money-trial-paper-trail-checks-00156408&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee5350002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee5350003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">meticulously showing jurors bank and accounting records</a>.</p><p>Daniels said that after the encounter Trump suggested they meet up again soon and tried to kiss her, but she was deeply upset. “My hands were shaking so hard, I was having a hard time getting dressed,” she said.</p><p>After the lunch break and outside the earshot of the jury, Trump’s lead lawyer Todd Blanche asked for a mistrial, complaining that Daniels’ testimony ventured into details that the judge had deemed off limits and that she’d suggested the sex — which Trump denies ever happened — was coerced.</p><p>“The court set guardrails for this testimony and the guardrails for this witness … were just thrown by the side. That testimony that came in was just so unduly and improperly prejudicial to President Trump. … This is the kind of testimony that makes it impossible to come back from,” Blanche said, before making an aside that it was particularly “unfair” because Trump “is going to go out and campaign this afternoon.”</p><p>Blanche also said Daniels’ description of the alleged sexual encounter was irrelevant to the charges against Trump: 34 felony counts of falsifying business records that prosecutors say are connected to $130,000 in hush money that Daniels received in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>“All of this has nothing to do with this case. … It’s still extraordinarily prejudicial to insert safety concerns into a trial about business records. … How can you unring the bell?” Blanche said.</p><p>Hoffinger insisted that prosecutors had been “extremely mindful” about not getting into too much detail about the alleged sex act, and she noted Daniels said “directly” that Trump didn’t threaten her or get violent. But the prosecutor said the porn star’s credibility is relevant.</p><p>“At the end of the day, this is what defendant was trying to hide,” Hoffinger said.</p><p>Merchan denied the mistrial motion, while saying: “I agree there were some things that would probably have been better left unsaid.” He called Daniels “a little difficult to control,” but also faulted Trump’s lawyers for not objecting more. “The defense has to take some responsibility for that,” the judge said.</p><p>Daniels returned to the stand looking a bit shaken from the morning testimony and relayed in detail to whom she’d disclosed the alleged encounter with Trump and how she interacted over the years with people who approached her to tell or sell her story.</p><p>One potentially damaging moment for Trump came as jurors heard Daniels read a Truth Social post from March 2023 in which he wrote: “I did NOTHING wrong in the ‘horseface’ case … She knows nothing about me. Never had an affair with her just another false accusation.”</p><p>For her part, Daniels seemed calm during most of the friendly questioning by the prosecution. She turned toward the jurors and delivered many of her answers directly to them. Her credibility seemed bolstered by the ample detail she offered about events nearly two decades ago.</p><p>During the several instances where Daniels walked in and out of the courtroom Tuesday, she folded her hands across her stomach. Clad in a black hooded sweater cape over a dark blouse and pants, she conveyed a somewhat studious appearance on the witness stand by lowering her eyeglasses from her head to her face each time she sat down.</p><p>At times, Daniels seemed to betray nervousness by speaking at such a rapid-fire pace that the court reporter and even the judge repeatedly implored her to slow down.</p><p>While Daniels seemed candid — perhaps to excess — as she was questioned by the prosecutor, on cross-examination by the defense she sometimes resorted to hair-splitting that seemed lawyerly. She acknowledged having sometimes issued false denials about her encounter with Trump, but at other times she insisted her attempts to throw cold water on the story were literally true.</p><p>As defense lawyer Susan Necheles unleashed a fusillade of questions, jurors who’d seemed bored with financial evidence on Monday watched intently. During the volleys, some whipped their heads back and forth like fans at a tennis match.</p><p>Early in the cross-examination, Daniels denied having engaged in “mock” questioning with prosecutors outside court, but later admitted she’d practiced so she “wouldn’t be too upset” on the stand.</p><p>While prosecutors generally avoided dwelling on Daniels’ main vocation, Necheles seemed to relish the word ‘pornography’ as she peppered her with questions about it.</p><p>“Do you recall testifying you started acting in pornography because you wanted to make more money?” Necheles said.</p><p>“Don’t we want to all make more money in our jobs?” Daniels countered.</p><p>Later, Daniels seemed evasive when she insisted she had not lost a libel suit against Trump that a judge dismissed. “He was prevailed, but I was not found to have lost,” Daniels declared.</p><p>Nearly shouting at Daniels, Necheles accused her of defying court orders to pay Trump hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees and suggested that undercut her credibility.</p><p>“In fact, you have not taken one penny out of your pocket to pay these awards,” Necheles thundered. “That was you saying, ‘I don’t care about a federal court order,’ right?”</p><p>Necheles also sought to defuse the “horseface” insult by contending Daniels gave as good as she got.</p><p>“You call him names all the time, right? … You despise him,” the defense lawyer said, noting a Daniels tweet that called Trump an “orange turd.”</p><p>“He made fun of me first,” Daniels replied.</p><p>Daniels grew emotional and raised her voice as Necheles suggested that Daniels had made up a story about being threatened by a man in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011 in what she viewed as a bid to keep her silent about Trump.</p><p>“This man never existed, did he?” Necheles said.</p><p>“He absolutely existed,” Daniels said.</p><p>But the defense’s main thrust was to portray Daniels as an unscrupulous profiteer. “You’re looking to get — extort money from President Trump, right?” Necheles said.</p><p>“False,” Daniels replied.</p><p>While Daniels’ credibility seemed to suffer somewhat from the exchanges with Necheles, her quick retorts to many of the defense lawyer’s barbs may have mitigated the damage.</p><p>“You’ve been making money by claiming that you had sex with Donald Trump for more than a decade. … That story has made you a lot of money, right?” Necheles ventured in one such volley.</p><p>“It has also cost me a lot of money,” Daniels replied sharply.</p><p>Necheles’ grilling of Daniels is expected to resume Thursday morning, after a previously-scheduled day off for the trial.</p><p><i>Ben Feuerherd contributed to this report.</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

There is no set trial date, and proceedings were derailed in recent months over allegations that the lead prosecutor, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, had committed ethical lapses stemming from a romantic relationship with a special prosecutor she hired.</p><p>After the trial judge, Scott McAfee, rejected a bid to kick Willis off the case, Trump and his co-defendants sought permission to appeal that ruling.

But the Georgia decision ensures that Trump’s other three criminal cases remain in limbo and are increasingly unlikely to reach a verdict before voters cast ballots this fall.</p><p>In addition to the Florida case, Trump’s other federal criminal case — on charges that he criminally conspired to subvert the 2020 election — is also teetering as the Supreme Court considers whether to declare him immune from the charges altogether. A trial this year is still possible if the justices do not grant Trump the sweeping presidential immunity he says should block the prosecution.</p><p>But the legal snags have raised the odds that Trump might never face a jury in either of the two federal cases, both of which were brought by special counsel Jack Smith. If Trump wins the election later this year and the two federal cases remain pending, he is all but certain to order the Justice Department to unravel them. And his lawyers have foreshadowed efforts to postpone the Georgia trial during a potential presidency, even if it is allowed to proceed by the state courts.</p><p>McAfee has said that for practical reasons at least two trials would be required in the case to deal with the sprawling roster of 15 defendants. Trump and 18 others were charged in the indictment Willis obtained last August, but four of the defendants pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.</p><p>Prosecutors have asked that Trump be tried alongside all other defendants, but McAfee hasn’t ruled on that request.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.) and Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), wrote in a letter to President Joe Biden first obtained by POLITICO.</p><p>Last week, the leaders of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus made <a href="https://chc.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/chc.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Tri%20Caucus%20Chair%20LTR_President%20Biden_AFFH%20Rule%20Support_0503024.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a similar request&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://chc.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/chc.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Tri%20Caucus%20Chair%20LTR_President%20Biden_AFFH%20Rule%20Support_0503024.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee53a0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018f-6b4e-dfb4-a1ef-6f6ee53a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a similar request</a> to Biden.</p><p>An administration spokesman declined to comment on a pending regulation. A HUD spokesperson said the rule is going through the interagency process.</p><p>A chief concern of the AFFH rule supporters is that the clock is ticking for the Biden administration to release regulations that cannot easily be rolled back if Trump is reelected, along with GOP majorities in both chambers. Regulations finalized within the last 60 legislative days of the term are subject to such rollback. When that will hit in 2024 is not yet clear because legislative days can change.</p><p>“Renters face unacceptable discriminatory barriers when accessing quality and affordable housing, and fair housing laws on the books aren’t being properly enforced since this critical rule was eliminated by the Trump administration,” Gomez said in a statement. That’s why Democrats are “urging the Biden administration to right this historic wrong, properly regulate fair housing laws and allow them to actually be enforced.”</p><p>The AFFH rule implements the Fair Housing Act’s requirement that HUD and groups that receive HUD funding don’t just pledge to avoid discrimination in housing policy, but also take affirmative steps to avoid it and to make up for decades of discriminatory actions in housing.</p><p>The Obama administration wrote the policy, which was undone in the Trump administration, when officials argued it placed too much of a burden on localities and represented federal overreach. The Biden administration rewrote the rules in a way that are similar to the Obama administration’s policy.</p><p>“The No. 1 thing I hear from my constituents is that housing is increasingly and consistently unaffordable,” Jayapal said in a statement, calling the AFFH rule “a step in the right direction.”</p>]]></content:encoded>
