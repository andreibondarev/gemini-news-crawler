The setting, a bodega where a man was fatally stabbed in 2022, certainly was. And maybe Trump’s freewheeling performance was, too.</p><p>But not far from where he rode <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/06/14/donald-trump-campaign-announcement-tower-escalator-oral-history-227148/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;down the escalator&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/06/14/donald-trump-campaign-announcement-tower-escalator-oral-history-227148/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e7a0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e7a0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">down the escalator</a> on his way to the White House in 2015, Trump’s appearance on Tuesday was a reminder of Trump’s ability not only to manufacture a sideshow, but to turn it into the main act — more Trump the thirsty tabloid character than Trump the former president or Trump the accused.</p><p>And if the opening two days of Trump’s criminal trial exposed the cost to his presidential campaign of his confinement to a New York courtroom, his bodega visit laid bare the opportunities.</p><p>“There’s something to be said for him believing that this trial — and the timing of this trial — could have a reverse effect on silencing him,” said Alice Stewart, a Republican strategist and veteran of past presidential campaigns. “Hours on end in a courtroom are tiring and excruciating. But once he’s outside the courtroom, he’s able to make up for lost time.”<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/d2/37/5b9b643d42759fa31d378b5fc273/useuntil-05-16-2024-trumptrial-026.jpg" /><br /><p>On Tuesday, Trump said he will “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/trump-bodega-alvin-bragg/index.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;campaign locally&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/trump-bodega-alvin-bragg/index.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e7a0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e7a0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">campaign locally</a>” during the trial. And the bodega visit was likely just the first of many such appearances. His advisers have said, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/13/trump-campaign-plans-trial-00152070" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;even on some trial days, to expect in-person and virtual events&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/13/trump-campaign-plans-trial-00152070&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e7a0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e7a0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">even on some trial days, to expect in-person and virtual events</a>. This week, it was almost like a “Trump for governor” or “Trump for mayor” campaign that never was — the whole episode barely connected to the idea of the presidency.</p><p>“Everything is screwed up in New York,” Trump said, “and the whole world is watching.”</p><p>It was a stretch for Trump to say that he will “make a heavy play for New York,” a state that has not voted for a Republican for president since 1984, and one where Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/new-york/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;lost to now-President Joe Biden by more than 23 percentage points in 2020&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/new-york/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e7a0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e7a0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">lost to now-President Joe Biden by more than 23 percentage points in 2020</a>.</p><p>But as he spoke with reporters in New York, a bastion of Democratic politics, Trump’s read of the news landscape — if not the political one — seemed spot on. In the media capital of the world, Trump said he suspected there was “more press here than there is if I went out to some nice location.”</p><p>“He’s right,” said Dave Catalfamo, a Republican consultant in New York.</p><p>Trump’s prosecutors had given Trump a “platform,” Catalfamo said, and the former president “takes advantage of his masterfully.”</p><p>“The way we consume our news now, and the way that he gets covered, he’s utilizing the stage that’s before him,” Catalfamo said.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/fa/ec/dcd60f0544c0bcdd5635ebe6ea6f/useuntil-05-16-2024-trumptrial-018.jpg" /><br /><p>The substance of Trump’s visit was a throwback to Trump’s messaging in the 2020 campaign, when, following the anti-police protests in the wake of George Floyd’s murder — and in an effort to replicate the Nixonian “law and order” rhetoric of half a century ago — he laced into Democrats for crime in the nation’s largest, Democratic-run cities.</p><p>But now, amid Trump’s own legal entanglements, the subject served another purpose for him — casting doubt on the legal system, much as he did the electoral system in 2020, portraying his accusers as partisans in an effort to discredit them.</p><p>Outside the bodega, Trump called his trial “rigged” and said of the judge overseeing his case, “There’s never been a judge so conflicted as this.”</p><p>Trump has repeatedly claimed that Justice Juan Merchan has conflicts of interest, and Trump's lawyers have unsuccessfully asked the judge to step down from the case. Last year, a New York judicial ethics panel <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/ipjudicialethicsopinions/23-54.htm" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;rejected Trump's allegations&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nycourts.gov/ipjudicialethicsopinions/23-54.htm&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e7b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e7b0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">rejected Trump's allegations</a> that Merchan is biased, concluding “the judge's impartiality cannot reasonably be questioned.”<br /></p><br /><p>There’s reason to think Trump may be having some success in this line of critique. Earlier this week, an <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/as-trumps-hush-money-case-begins-about-a-third-believe-he-has-done-something-illegal/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apnorc.org/projects/as-trumps-hush-money-case-begins-about-a-third-believe-he-has-done-something-illegal/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e7b0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e7b0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll</a> found 44 percent of Americans are “not very” or “not at all” confident that prosecutors in New York are treating Trump fairly, and another 22 percent who are only “somewhat confident” they are.</p><p>But no matter where viewers stood on Trump, they could at least see in his appearance on Tuesday the kind of joy-riding former president they recognized.</p><p>That is in sharp contrast to his time in court, which by most accounts has been a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/16/trump-trial-reality-criminal-defendant-00152421" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;comedown for him&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/16/trump-trial-reality-criminal-defendant-00152421&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e7b0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e7b0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">comedown for him</a>.

Ahead of the November elections, he has spoken with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, dined with British foreign secretary David Cameron, and met with Argentine President Javier Milei and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, according to two people familiar with the talks. Cameron has said that he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/10/trump-david-cameron-russia-ukraine-aid/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>discussed&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/10/trump-david-cameron-russia-ukraine-aid/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e7e0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e7e0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>discussed</u></a> the question of funding for Ukraine with the former president, according to the Washington Post.</p><p>Trump and Duda have long had a warm relationship. Duda has once proposed naming a military base in Poland “Fort Trump” and he visited the White House in 2020, when Trump was in the middle of his reelection campaign.</p><p>But Duda, whose term ends in 2025, has pushed the Biden administration to provide more aid to Ukraine, which borders Poland.

Then the weird emails started to arrive.</p><p>At least one state legislative office received a message — purporting to be from the commission charged with drafting the budget language — with a bill document written in a Cyrillic language.</p><p>It was a sign of a bigger problem: It was likely sent, officials assumed, by the same people who had launched a cyberattack on the commission’s computers and are now demanding a ransom.</p><p>The incident left the state budget deal in limbo and raised new questions about states’ ability to protect its critical digital infrastructure.</p><p>The problem was so befuddling that Gov. Kathy Hochul said the state commission had to turn to a computer system from 1994 so it can continue work as the state Legislature and the Democratic governor try to finalize the $237 billion spending plan.</p><p>One state official familiar with the details of the attack, and granted anonymity because of the ongoing investigation, said no specific dollar amount was being sought by the attackers at the moment. A ransomware attack occurs when a perpetrator blocks access to a system until a specific amount of money is paid.</p><p>“We’ve been more concerned about finding the source, finding how we can remedy this, how we can get back to normal so it’s something we’ve been dealing with since the wee hours of the morning,” Hochul said in a radio interview on WNYC.</p><p>The incident is another reminder of how federal and state governments, private entities and other municipalities continue to be at <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/12/pentagon-cyber-command-private-companies-00115206" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;heightened awareness&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/12/pentagon-cyber-command-private-companies-00115206&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e810002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e810003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">heightened awareness</a> for cyberattacks and struggle to find ways to thwart them. In New York alone, attacks on critical online infrastructure rose by 53 percent between 2016 and 2022, <a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/files/reports/pdf/cyberattacks-on-new-yorks-critical-infrastructure.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a report last year by&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.osc.ny.gov/files/reports/pdf/cyberattacks-on-new-yorks-critical-infrastructure.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e810004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e810005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a report last year by</a> the state Comptroller’s Office found.</p><p>Hochul and top legislative leaders insisted the attack would not hinder budget negotiations, but all lawmakers wanted to talk about the newest twist thwarting a final deal — joking about how the Russians are attacking, but also offering a dose of reality that it might keep them in Albany longer.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/fe/3d/8cfa1bfc45f498e76113801e68a0/img-5540.jpg" /><br /><p>“I think on the light side, it’s mildly entertaining at such a tense period in our budget negotiations,” state Sen. Jessica Ramos, a Queens Democrat, said. “And at worst, it can cause a delay to make me late to pick up my kids from school – so I don’t appreciate that.”</p><p>Lawmakers wrapped up their regular legislative sessions without any immediate plan on how to proceed as the threat was still being investigated.</p><p>Senate Finance Committee chair Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat, said she was told it was a ransomware attack.</p><p>“The implication was it was a hacking type of thing. I don’t know if someone sent us a bill,” she told POLITICO.</p><p>The state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services was involved in reviewing the incident. The office declined to comment on an ongoing investigation.</p><p>Hochul in the radio interview said “it will take a little bit longer to deal with the legislative side of” passing the budget due to the attack. But she promised there are workarounds.</p><p>Her office said it would not comment further, citing the investigation.</p><p>The 1994 system was what the Legislature used for most of its time before cyberspace. It was replaced by a system that was created after Democrats assumed the majority in the state Senate in 2019.</p><p>The old system “was very antiquated,” said a person familiar with the Legislature’s technological infrastructure. “For something that important, you shouldn’t use 30-year-old technology.”</p><p>For now, the return to the old system seems to be working. The state’s legislative tracking service was updated throughout the day to include new resolutions that had been introduced and account bills that passed the Senate.</p><p>New York last dealt with a widespread cyberattack in January 2020 when multiple state agencies, including the Department of Motor Vehicles, were targeted.</p><p>With the state budget already 17 days late, lawmakers are hoping the attack will not cause further delay in passing a spending plan.</p><p>"It's a bit of Murphy's Law, where you think everything that could go wrong has already gone wrong and then this happens,” Buffalo Sen. Sean Ryan told POLITICO. “Hopefully it’s a temporary glitch.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

Shafik seemed far more prepared than the presidents of Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who testified before the committee that month.</p><p>She told one GOP lawmaker that she spent “many hours” preparing, and another GOP lawmaker congratulated her on “saying the right things.”</p><p>“Columbia beats Harvard and UPenn!” Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/aa338d02-bfc3-48a3-9c87-d7842e7af1f6" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Aaron Bean&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/aa338d02-bfc3-48a3-9c87-d7842e7af1f6&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e860000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e860001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Aaron Bean</a> (R-Fla.) said. “Y'all have done something that they weren't able to do.

Republicans, and even some Democrats, focused on getting rid of university faculty who they say used antisemitic rhetoric.</p><p>Shafik, who testified alongside Board of Trustees Co-Chairs Claire Shipman and David Greenwald, and law professor David Schizer, one of the university’s antisemitism taskforce chairs, answered personnel questions about faculty and students, and attempted to address some of the bizarre questions from GOP lawmakers about the Bible and the definition of the term “folx.”</p><p>Questions about whether protests on campus were anti-Jewish or anti-Muslim, or if phrases used by students were antisemitic, however, gave Shafik pause. In those moments the other Columbia leaders chimed in — but that didn’t stop lawmakers from poking holes in Shafik’s testimony. </p><p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/19aaa822-11fd-4f17-b003-e0291965010d" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Virginia Foxx&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/19aaa822-11fd-4f17-b003-e0291965010d&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e860002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e860003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Virginia Foxx</a> (R-N.C.), who helms the House education panel, called some of Shafik’s testimony misleading, and Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/84d7d4ed-17f5-46aa-b486-b25a755a4a87" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Elise Stefanik&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/84d7d4ed-17f5-46aa-b486-b25a755a4a87&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e860004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e860005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Elise Stefanik</a> (R-N.Y.), who had previously given the other presidents the toughest grilling, tried to accuse Shafik of changing her testimony.</p><p>Here are the top five moments from the hearing.<br /></p><h2></h2><h2 style="text-align: left">Stefanik tried, and tried, and tried, to create a memorable scene</h2><p>The No. 4 Republican in the House, who was the first lawmaker to take her seat in the hearing room, showed up with a thick stack of documents littered with yellow sticky notes.

The chair of the Senate committee that oversees aviation says she wants to act fast with a fresh bill — but doing anything quickly in a Congress mired in disagreement is a tall order.</p><p>One hearing included testimony from whistleblowers who said bosses at Boeing had threatened them for calling attention to shoddy safety practices, with one saying the company also sought to cover up information about the flaws.</p><p>Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour described a company culture of putting production over safety — which he said included practices such as trying to make parts fit together by jumping on them, which he called the “Tarzan effect.” But the part of his testimony that drew gasps from people in the room was his description of how he says his supervisors reacted to his attempts to report the problems.</p><p>“My boss said, ‘I would have killed someone who said what you said in a meeting,’” Salehpour told members of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.</p><p>In a statement on Wednesday’s hearings, Boeing said retaliation is “strictly prohibited” and that though it has taken “important steps to foster a safety culture that empowers and encourages all employees to raise their voice,” the company knows it has “more work to do.”</p><p>The testimony was “more than troubling,” Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151822" target="_blank" data-person-id="151822" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1713393808831,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f766-d6b4-a7e5-f7ee71fe0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1713393808831,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-f766-d6b4-a7e5-f7ee71fe0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;151822\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151822\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Sen.

In the other, the embassy emphasized that not all ByteDance board members were Chinese nationals.</p><p>The embassy also sought to claim the company as Chinese, the staffers said, despite TikTok’s public efforts to distance itself from the origin of its founders. TikTok, unlike ByteDance, is based in Singapore and the United States. In one of the meetings, the embassy argued that the legislation amounted to a forced data transfer of a Chinese company, according to the House staffer. In the other, the embassy argued that the effort was not fair to a Chinese company because the U.S. would not treat a company with a different national origin the same way, according to the Senate staffer.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350650744112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>TikTok said in a statement that the embassy meetings were “news to us, and it's absurd to ask us to comment on anonymous sources we know nothing about.”</p><p>“Since the bill's introduction, we've been publicly vocal about why we oppose the ban bill,” said Alex Haurek, a TikTok spokesperson. “This so-called reporting doesn't pass the smell test and it's irresponsible for Politico to print it."</p><p>The Chinese Embassy, however, did not deny having held the meetings. In a statement, embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said that the “Chinese Embassy in the US tries to tell the truth about the TikTok issue to people from all walks of life in the US.”</p><p>“This is not about lobbying for a single company,” the spokesperson added, “but about whether all Chinese companies can be treated fairly.”</p><p>The statement went on to repeat some of the arguments that staffers said had been made at the meetings, including pushing back on national security concerns, and emphasizing international investment in ByteDance.</p><p>The statement also emphasized that although TikTok’s operation is legal, the United States “has tried every means to use state power to suppress it.”</p><p>TikTok has armed itself with dozens of lobbyists and spent millions of dollars to push back on the narrative around the company in Washington, where the app’s opponents have repeatedly argued that it’s a powerful tool for China to influence sentiment in the United States. The company has also spent millions on advertisements to rally public support against the legislation and leveraged its consumer base via push alerts that allowed the app’s users to easily call Congress.

Aaron Dean, the adjutant general of the D.C. guard at the time, told House Administration Committee staffers that if Trump had reached out that day — which, by all accounts, he did not — he might have helped cut through the chaos amid a tangle of conflicting advice and miscommunication.</p><p>“Could the president have picked up the phone, called the secretary of defense, and said, you know, ‘What’s going on here?’ Our law enforcement is getting overrun, make this happen!’” a committee staffer asked Brooks, according to the transcript of a previously unreported March 14 interview reviewed by POLITICO.</p><p>“I assume he could expedite an approval through the Secretary of Defense, through the Secretary of the Army,” Brooks replied.</p><p>But Trump never called any military leaders on Jan. 6, per testimony from senior administration officials to the Jan. 6 select committee — a fact that the panel emphasized in its final report that concluded Trump was uniquely responsible for the violent Capitol attack by his supporters. Rather, he was observing the riot on TV and calling allies in his quest to subvert the 2020 election, as outlined by committee witnesses and White House records.</p><p>Brooks’ exchange with the committee staffer underscored the reality of Trump’s inaction: “And to your knowledge, did that happen on January 6th?” the staffer continued.</p><p>“No,” Brooks said.</p><p>Dean, similarly, noted that if Trump had placed a call to Pentagon leaders at 2 p.m. — around the time the Capitol was first breached — and said “go,” the guard would have reached the Capitol sooner than it did that day.</p><p>“I think if the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of Defense, or the president had said ‘Go,’ … or a combination thereof had said ‘Go,’ then we would’ve gone and we would’ve been there much faster,” Dean told congressional investigators on March 26.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/dc/4f/38758f43414aabe4de707d38e517/capitol-riot-newspaper-editor-33208.jpg" /><br /><p>Brooks and Dean are among four witnesses slated to testify Wednesday before a House subcommittee probing security failures that exacerbated the breach of the Capitol. All four were top advisers to William Walker, the commander of the D.C. guard on Jan. 6. Other witnesses include Timothy Nick, who was the aide-de-camp to Walker, and Earl Matthews, a top lawyer for the National Guard at the time. POLITICO reviewed transcripts of closed-door interviews that all four men gave to the Administration Committee over the past five weeks.</p><p>The bulk of their testimony focused on deep disagreement between the D.C. guard leadership and the Pentagon about when and whether an order was given to deploy to the Capitol. The witnesses told the Administration Committee that military leaders seemed reluctant to send guard troops to the Capitol until hours after violence had broken out.</p><p>Further, they described mixed messages on phone calls with the Pentagon that left them in a holding pattern, lacking clarity about whether they had permission to deploy. All four also indicated they had testified to the Jan. 6 committee in an “informal” capacity, meaning there were no transcripts of their interviews.</p><p>And they said they had virtually no contact from Ryan McCarthy, the then-Army secretary, even though he was a key player who was in frequent contact with the D.C. guard in the run-up to Jan. 6.</p><p>McCarthy did not respond to a request for comment. He has <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000042158/pdf/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000042158.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;told the Jan. 6 committee&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000042158/pdf/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000042158.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e970002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e970003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">told the Jan. 6 committee</a> that a call from Trump would not have hastened the National Guard response because he was already moving as quickly as possible.</p><p>The testimony is the latest addition to a complicated picture of the military’s response to the violence, which raged for hours on Jan. 6 until the D.C. police and National Guard helped the Capitol Police contain it that evening. The riot select committee found that Trump made no calls to senior leaders of the Justice Department, Pentagon or Department of Homeland Security while the violence raged — nor did he reach out to his vice president, Mike Pence, who was sheltering from the mob at the Capitol.</p><p>Rather, Trump watched the riot unfold on TV and made phone calls to lawmakers who he hoped would support his bid to block President Joe Biden’s victory.</p><p>The men, whom the panel described as “whistleblowers,” sharply dispute claims by former Pentagon leaders — from McCarthy to then-Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller to former Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley — that the National Guard was deployed to the Capitol as quickly as possible on Jan. 6.</p><p>Rather, they say, they had no contact from Miller or McCarthy until much later in the day, and they sharply dispute claims that McCarthy authorized the guard’s deployment to the Capitol by 3:04 p.m. on Jan. 6.</p><p>That’s the context in which Brooks and Dean suggested that perhaps a phone call from Trump — as conditions at the Capitol were clearly deteriorating — could have cut through the clutter and resulted in a quicker deployment.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6348435513112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Matthews differed from Brooks and Dean on the question of whether Trump’s involvement could have made a difference. Because Trump had already delegated authority to Miller and McCarthy, there was little for him to do, according to Matthews, who told the Administration Committee that it’s not clear whether McCarthy would have heeded his call.</p><p>“The president wasn’t going to call us because he’s trusting the chain of command,” Matthews told the Administration panel. He noted that some testimony to the Jan. 6 committee underscored concerns among military leaders that Trump might try using a troop presence at the Capitol for nefarious purposes.</p><p>In his testimony to the Jan. 6 committee, McCarthy denied harboring concerns that Trump might misuse the National Guard.</p><p>“I mean, in the lead-up to it, [I] did not see anything that would give you the sense he was going to order us to send troops to the Capitol in support of anything untoward,” McCarthy said.</p><p>In a statement Matthews issued ahead of his public testimony, he elaborated on his belief.</p><p>“The committee knew that even if President Trump had called down personally to the Secretary of the Army, who had effective operational control of the D.C. National Guard, to direct the immediate movement of the Guard, it would have had no impact.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

But it is a clear acknowledgment that Johnson’s proposal is the closest Democrats may get to approving much-needed aid to Ukraine and Israel.</p><p>It would also mark a significant victory: The House plan hews closely to the Senate’s White House-backed bill, down to the dollar figures. The House plan would also allow some of economic aid to Ukraine to be repayable.</p><p>The White House had held back commenting on Johnson’s proposal until text was released mid-day Wednesday.</p><p>Biden cited the need to get “critical support” to Israel and Ukraine, send humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza and bolster security in the Indo Pacific as the reasons for their support.</p><p>“Israel is facing unprecedented attacks from Iran, and Ukraine is facing continued bombardment from Russia that has intensified dramatically in the last month,” he said.</p><p>The White House’s support comes after the final proposals largely mirrored what Johnson personally outlined to Biden during a phone call on Monday night. Crucially, the bill providing aid to Israel also includes more than $9 billion in humanitarian assistance to Gaza, a top administration priority that was seen as critical to convincing Democratic lawmakers to get behind Johnson’s plan.</p><p>Biden and his allies had long supported the Senate’s bill, arguing as recently as this week that it remained the simplest way of delivering aid to the U.S.’s allies. But officials granted Johnson leeway to chart his own path over the last few days in part out of a fresh recognition that battlefield conditions had grown dire — and delivering assistance as soon as possible was essential.</p><p>The administration’s backing could risk further alienating some House conservatives who have come out against the measure.</p><p>The White House has warned for months that Ukraine’s ability to defend its territory was compromised without more U.S. aid. But a bleak first-person evaluation provided last week by Gen. Christopher Cavoli, the top U.S. commander in Europe and NATO, ratcheted concerns within the administration to new levels.</p><p>“All signs are blinking red right now, and I think the White House is really concerned about where things are headed,” said one foreign policy expert in touch with the White House, granted anonymity to provide a candid assessment.</p><p>Biden has repeatedly stressed the need for the House to approve aid to Ukraine by the end of the week, amid fears that the nation is running out of munitions needed for its air defense ahead of a potential major Russian offensive early on in the summer.</p><p>In particular, one worry expressed by Ukrainians in recent days is that Russia will take advantage of the country’s flagging air defense to target energy infrastructure — crippling the power grid, grinding its defense industry to a halt and tanking the overall economy.</p><p>“They are within weeks — literally within weeks — of potentially really losing a lot of territory,” said Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and former U.S. ambassador to NATO. “Everybody should realize that a Ukrainian defeat brings the possibility of direct military conflict between the United State and Russia closer.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s How We Lost America’s Trust,” which <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/npr-editor-how-npr-lost-americas-trust" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;napalms NPR’s reputation&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.thefp.com/p/npr-editor-how-npr-lost-americas-trust&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e9e0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e9e0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">napalms NPR’s reputation</a> and the news standards of his NPR colleagues. The piece enjoyed an extended run on X, where everybody who hates NPR and everybody who worships it <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=berliner&amp;src=typed_query" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;queued up to debate it&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=berliner&amp;src=typed_query&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e9e0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e9e0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">queued up to debate it</a>.</p><p>But as is often the case when employers punish their workers, Berliner’s transgression was not as much about what he did (write an outside piece without permission) but what he said. Let’s not kid ourselves. He was docked a week’s pay for his message, not his conduct. If Berliner had, say, written a poem for the <i>New Yorker</i>, or reviewed a book for the <i>Washington Post </i>without first getting a sign-off from NPR, he might have gotten congratulations from his bosses or at the very worst, a polite scolding for not following the rules. Berliner’s real “crime” is that he trashed his own institution in public, and did it loudly, and when you do that in most places of employment, a sharp reprimand is sure to follow.</p> <p>Editors have, of course, been contending with increasingly contentious staffers over the past decades who take their grievances public. Social media has proved a powerful amplifier of their beefs.</p><p><br />Some observers might think the Berliner reprimand shows that fed up bosses are finally starting to crack down on rowdy employees. But that’s too generous of an interpretation. Berliner could have dumped bilge on NPR and still gotten a clean getaway if he had indemnified himself by bringing a posse of similar malcontents with him, as this <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/28/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc-newsroom-power-shift-00149408" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;previous column&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/28/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc-newsroom-power-shift-00149408&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e9e000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e9e000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">previous column</a> demonstrates.</p><p>When Chuck Todd ripped NBC News for having hired Ronna McDaniel as a paid commentator, he took his case to an NBC News show, <i>Meet the Press</i>, indicating that he had buy-in from other NBCers. Indeed he did, as they vocally seconded his protest of the hiring.</p><p>Another way to bring your posse with you is to launch your rebellion on your outlet’s internal Slack account. Newsroom staffers are natural complainers and fault-finders. That’s one of the reasons they chose the profession in the first place. If you assemble a newsroom of journalists, you can confidently predict an altercation unless you’ve got a lion tamer on retainer. It also benefits a protester to bring to the revolt an identarian complaint that includes race, sexual orientation, religion or gender. Bosses get wiggy when forced to parse an identity-based complaint. Unfortunately for Berliner, he couldn’t take that route.</p><p>We have learned in recent years that when staffers start shouting at the bosses on Slack or in a petition, the bosses squirm. It happened at POLITICO after bosses gave <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/politico-ben-shapiro_n_60009e8dc5b6efae62f6f2f7" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Ben Shapiro an assignment&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/politico-ben-shapiro_n_60009e8dc5b6efae62f6f2f7&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e9e000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e9e000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Ben Shapiro an assignment</a>; it happened at the <i>New York Times </i>after it published <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/5/21280425/new-york-times-tom-cotton-send-troops-staff-revolt" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Sen.

Coordinated Slack and social media posts on X give staffers new-found leverage in their tussles with management. How can you beat down a newsroom when everybody holding down a desk is shouting, “I am Spartacus”? It’s impractical to crucify your entire staff.</p><p>If Berliner had dropped his bomb after organizing like-minded colleagues at NPR to support him — or even enlisted a gaggle after publishing the broadside against his network — he would have remained untouchable. Bosses everywhere are good at admonishing individuals. But they wilt against numbers.</p><p>Perhaps Berliner didn’t assemble a posse because support for his anti-NPR views, so publicly visible and voluble on the outside, is not common inside the broadcaster, even though Berliner told NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo that he has “<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/16/media/npr-suspends-editor-uri-berliner-who-called-out-left-wing-bias/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a lot of support&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nypost.com/2024/04/16/media/npr-suspends-editor-uri-berliner-who-called-out-left-wing-bias/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e9e0012&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e9e0013&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a lot of support</a>” inside the newsroom. It’s likely that Berliner thought the best way to achieve maximum impact for his anti-NPR diatribe would be to intentionally draw an official rebuke from the network and thereby become a martyr and then resign in protest. It doesn’t require a Ph.D. in game theory to see that Berliner, who was <a href="https://findingaids.smith.edu/repositories/2/resources/1123" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;born in 1956&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://findingaids.smith.edu/repositories/2/resources/1123&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e9e0014&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e9e0015&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">born in 1956</a> and now qualifies for Medicare, got what he wanted. Surely a book contract and speaking engagements will follow.</p><p>Most of Berliner’s complaints about how progressive groupthink has tarnished NPR track well under scrutiny. What does not is his observation that only “in recent years” has the network stopped resembling “America at large.” Even a casual NPR listener knows that what Berliner says about NPR has been true for at least 40 years, and surely for the 25 years he has worked there. NPR knows its listeners’ preconceptions well, and has indulged them for a long time. What took Berliner so long to discover the self-evident?</p><p>Steve Oney, whose history of NPR, <i>On Air</i>, comes out next year, says in an interview that the network has never been good at managing its own press.</p><p> <br /></p><br /><p><br />“They think they’re small time when in fact they’re big time,’ he says, and it shows whenever the network finds itself in the news. Oney goes on to cite the departures of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna4586432" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Bob Edwards&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna4586432&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e9f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e9f0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Bob Edwards</a> two decades ago, when he left NPR after his demotion from anchor, and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/10/21/npr.analyst.fired/index.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Juan Williams&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/10/21/npr.analyst.fired/index.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e9f0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4e9f0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Juan Williams</a> in 2010, who was let go on charges of veering from analysis into opinion, as prime examples of that flat-footedness.

Both Trump and Lake have sensed electoral danger in the court’s decision as Republicans have struggled with how to talk about — and set policy on — abortion in the post-<i>Roe</i> era.</p><p>The status quo threatens to leave unresolved an issue that Trump had hoped to put behind him last week when he said that it is now up to the states and voters to set abortion policy. When the Arizona high court ruled the following day on the 1864 law, which has no exceptions for rape or incest, Trump quickly said the ruling went too far and that state lawmakers would rewrite the law.</p><p>“I think it’ll be straightened out and, as you know, it’s all about state’s rights and it will be straightened out,” Trump said last week. “And I’m sure the governor and everybody else have got to bring it back into reason and that it will be taken care of I think.”</p><p>But the last week has shown how difficult that can be even with Trump’s prodding.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350697049112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>The moves by state House Republicans, who twice rejected efforts <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/AZ_24R_HB_2677?q=hb2677" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;to bring a repeal forward&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/AZ_24R_HB_2677?q=hb2677&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ea40002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ea40003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">to bring a repeal forward</a>, highlights the deepening divide between the more socially conservative wing of the party, which opposes abortion on moral grounds, and the more populist, MAGA branch, including Trump and Lake, that is seeking a more politically pragmatic approach.</p><p>“Abortion is a very complicated topic. It is ethically, morally complex,” Republican House Speaker Ben Toma said Wednesday on the floor. “I understand that we have deeply held beliefs, and I would ask everyone in this chamber to respect the fact that some of us believe that abortion is in fact the murder of children.”</p><p>It also is likely to fuel efforts by abortion-rights groups to pass a ballot measure in November protecting the right to abortion until fetal viability in the state constitution.</p><p>Shortly after the House vote, two Republicans in the state Senate — Shawnna Bolick and T.J. Shope — voted with Democrats to <a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/81538" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>allow the introduction of a Senate bill&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/81538&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ea40004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ea40005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>allow the introduction of a Senate bill</u></a> similar to the legislation the House declined to vote on Wednesday. However, even if Bolick and Shope continue to stand with Democrats and pass the Senate version, the proposal’s future remains dim in the House.</p><p>Republican divisions over a path forward on abortion policy in the post-<i>Roe</i> era are not unique to Arizona. GOP legislative leaders in Indiana, South Carolina and West Virginia similarly grappled with crafting policies that would appeal to enough members of their caucus to pass, but none of those debates have happened in a state so critical to the 2024 election.</p><p>The Senate can now advance its repeal proposal, and Democrats in the House are likely to continue trying to persuade another Republican to join them before they reconvene next week. But if Republicans can’t reach a consensus, they risk ceding the issue to Democrats who have spent the last week reminding people that Arizona’s abortion law predates not only its statehood but a woman’s right to vote and the legal end to slavery.</p><p>“This is what we are arguing about right now whether or not we should overturn something that is archaic, something that is going to really impact women in Arizona,” said state Rep. Alma Hernandez, a Democrat, on the floor.</p><p>Prior to the House vote, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs spoke with a few Republicans about repealing the 1864 law and indicated she would sign legislation doing so, according to a source familiar with negotiations between the governor’s office and Republican lawmakers, who was granted anonymity to speak about private discussions.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350582126112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Ultimately only one House Republican, state Rep. Matt Gress, joined Democrats in supporting their repeal efforts. Democrats needed two House Republicans to side with them to move a vote forward and repeal the ban.</p><p>“Republican extremists in the House have yet again failed to do the right thing. In just one week living under this new reality, women, doctors, and healthcare providers have already begun to feel the devastating effects of living under a total abortion ban,” Hobbs said in a statement Wednesday. “We cannot go on like this.”</p><p>Some House Republicans who in recent days voiced openness to supporting a repeal of the law, including state Rep. David Cook, voted against suspending the rules that would have allowed them to do so.</p><p>But anti-abortion groups, including the Center for Arizona Policy, lobbied hard against the measure. Still, the group’s president, Cathi Herrod, said in a text prior to the vote that it was “not clear how things will go.”</p><p>Republican lawmakers have also floated pushing for a ballot measure on abortion that would punt the question directly to voters. Three options were presented to lawmakers in a slideshow shown during a legislative caucus meeting on Monday: protecting the legislature’s ability to set abortion policy without setting a limit on the number of weeks; prohibiting abortion after 14 weeks of pregnancy; or banning it after roughly six-weeks gestation.</p><p>Linley Wilson, general counsel for the Arizona House, wrote in the presentation that the strategy not only “changes the narrative” on abortion by allowing Republicans to insist that they “have a plan,” but that any ballot measure could draw votes away from the other effort by abortion-rights proponents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A decision on that is still pending in the lower court.</p><p>Wednesday's decision from the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals preserves a lower court’s preliminary injunction that changes New Jersey’s unique ballot design from what’s known as the “county line” to office-block ballots — where candidates are grouped together by the office they are seeking. All other states use such ballots. But for about a century, New Jersey has grouped candidates by party-backing, a system that critics say gives local parties unique influence over elections.</p><p>“[T]he record before us supports the District Court’s ruling. It shows that the county-line system is discriminatory — it picks winners and punishes those who are not endorsed or, because of their political views, want to disassociate from certain endorsed candidates,” Judge Kent Jordan wrote for the court. "Those disfavored candidates are put in undesirable ballot positions and, by random coupling, can end up paired with potentially objectionable candidates. Those outcomes amount to a severe burden on the Plaintiffs’ rights.”</p><p>Kim and two Democratic House candidates, Sarah Schoengood and Carolyn Rush, filed a lawsuit in February seeking to eliminate the county line. Studies have shown candidates being on the line gives them a nearly insurmountable electoral advantage, while candidates “off the line” seldom win. Kim’s lawsuit named 19 county clerks as defendants.</p><p>The lawsuit was filed when Kim was in a hotly contested Democratic primary for Senate against New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy. At the time, she had the backing of Democratic party bosses, meaning she would have had the favorable ballot positioning in a majority of the state, but she dropped out amid backlash to her candidacy that largely focused on her institutional support that seemed to give her an advantage.</p><p>While most county clerks initially appealed the preliminary injunction, all of them quickly dropped their appeals after the 3rd Circuit <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/03/new-jersey-ballot-andy-kim-00150411" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;declined to block the preliminary injunction&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/03/new-jersey-ballot-andy-kim-00150411&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ebc0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ebc0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">declined to block the preliminary injunction</a>. The Camden County Democratic Committee, which intervened in the lawsuit, was the only appellant remaining. Bill Tambussi, an attorney for Camden Democrats, said the organization "respects the decision" of the court but did not explicitly say what the committee’s next steps would be in the lawsuit.</p><p>Kim’s lawsuit still seeks a permanent end to the county line — the preliminary injunction applies only to this year’s primary election — and a separate federal lawsuit from 2020 also seeks to do so. The 3rd Circuit judges said the plaintiffs “have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their First Amendment claims.” </p><p>The lawsuit has attracted attention outside of the initial parties in the case. The New Jersey Republican Chairs Association and Middlesex County Democratic Organization — one of the state’s leading political machines — submitted legal filings in defense of the county line. Civil rights and good government groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, League of Women Voters and others have submitted filings against the county line.</p><p>(The preliminary injunction ordered by U.S. District Judge Zahid Quraishi in late March only applied to this year’s Democratic and not Republican primary).</p><p>New Jersey politics has been dominated by talk of the county line in recent months, in large part because of the Senate race. Top Democratic and GOP state lawmakers have said they will address ballot design (they have not committed to what that would look like). And it has spilled over into the 2025 governor’s race, with Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop’s campaign submitting legal filings against the line.</p><p>New Jersey’s primary elections have long been defined by who does and does not receive the line. Each county in the state differs in how the county line is awarded. In some counties, hundreds of low-level party officials vote by secret ballot. In others, a handful of party leaders — or a single party boss — decides who gets the line.</p><p>The Camden County Democratic Committee had argued that eliminating the county line would breach its own First Amendment rights to association. The appellate judges dismissed that claim.</p><p>“Nothing in the preliminary injunction prohibits the CCDC from including county parties’ slogans on the ballot, endorsing candidates, communicating those endorsements, or associating by any other constitutional means. The injunction simply means that the CCDC does not get to bracket its preferred candidates together on the ballot,” Jordan wrote. </p><p>The county party also invoked the Purcell Principle, a U.S. Supreme Court precedent that generally advises courts to not change election rules close to an election so as not to cause confusion among voters.</p><p>But Jordan wrote that the lower court’s decision wold “reduce, if not eliminate voter confusion” and said that the arguments of the Camden County Democrats in court and the Middlesex County Democrats in their amicus brief “appear contrary to the record and based on nothing but speculation.” </p><p>Read the court’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000018e-edeb-dd90-a5ee-edeb51bb0000" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;opinion here&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000018e-edeb-dd90-a5ee-edeb51bb0000&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ebc0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ebc0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">opinion here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

"The topic, however, remains of great interest to me and to those who have supported this bill thus far."</p><p>Her bill would have expanded the state’s current End Of Life Options Act to allow patients without a specific prognosis to request life-ending drugs if they are suffering from a “grievous and irremediable medical condition.” Current law in California and all other states says patients can only request these drugs when they have six months left to live.</p><p>It also added dementia to the list of conditions that could qualify, but specified that only having a mental health condition does not.</p><p>The proposal faced opposition from all sides, even from lobbying groups and legislators that have pushed for similar laws in the past. Compassion &amp; Choices, a national group that lobbies for end of life options, was against it from the start for straying from the six-month standard for terminal patients and for including dementia. </p><p>Sen. Susan Talamantes Eggman, who authored the original End of Life Options Act in 2016, came out against the most recent expansion, posting on X that, “While I have compassion for those desiring further change, pushing for too much too soon puts CA &amp; the country at risk of losing the gains we have made for personal autonomy.”</p><p>Religious groups like the California Catholic Conference have long opposed California’s aid-in-dying law on moral grounds. Disability rights advocates have also argued that aid-in-dying laws create a two-tiered system where people with disabilities or chronic illnesses who want to die are given the option to do so, but people without disabilities who express suicidal thoughts are not. Several groups sued the state over the 2021 expansion of the End Of Life Options Act, but the case was dismissed by the U.S. District Court in March.</p><p>“It’s clearly an overreach,” said Tim Rosales, a spokesperson for Patients Rights Action Fund, which opposes the bill. ”They probably had not done their due diligence on the issue.”</p><p>With just a few weeks left to pass bills through policy committees before the Legislature’s summer recess, it’s unlikely another lawmaker would proposal a similar measure this year. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Adams spokesperson Fabien Levy declined to confirm City Hall was hiring Mastro, or discuss how the administration intends to win support for the pick.</p><p>“No appointment is confirmed until, and if, it is announced, but if there was an appointment, of course we’d work collaboratively with our partners across the hall,” he said, referring to the council.</p><p>Mastro has earned a reputation as an aggressive litigator, and one person close to the mayor suggested the council should be happy with a “bulldog” representing the city government.</p><p>If confirmed as the administration’s corporation counsel, Mastro would represent the city as a whole, not just the mayor.

This includes but is not limited to sending to the house file, prospecting vendors, and advertising,” Trump co-campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita wrote in the letter, which is dated April 15.</p><p>They add: “Any split that is higher than 5% will be seen favorably by the RNC and President Trump's campaign and is routinely reported to the highest levels of leadership within both organizations.”</p><p>Trump officials insisted that the purpose of the 5 percent request was not to raise money for themselves but rather to dissuade “scammers” from using Trump’s brand without his permission and diluting his ability to raise cash.</p><p>The letter comes as Trump is struggling to close a fundraising gap with President Joe Biden. Biden’s campaign has said that it has raised over $190 million, more than double what Trump has taken in. Trump’s campaign has acknowledged that it will be outraised by Biden, though it has been looking to make up ground, with large and small donors alike. By asking Republican candidates to break off a chunk of their proceeds, the Trump campaign would enlarge its bank account. </p><p>The letter was sent the same week Trump’s hush-money trial began in New York. The trial is expected to last at least six weeks and will greatly hinder the former president’s ability to hit the campaign trail with just seven months left before the November election.</p><p>Down-ballot Republican candidates and committees have long used Trump in fundraising appeals, recognizing that he has support among the party’s small-dollar fundraising base. But in the letter, Wiles and LaCivita reiterated their request that Republicans “avoid” using certain “language and tactics” while using Trump’s name, image and likeness. </p><p>The letter, for example, asks that candidates not speak “on behalf of President Trump,” “mention of the President's family without their consent or the consent of the campaign,” or [impersonate] President Trump or his campaign.”</p><p>After taking over the Republican National Committee last month, the Trump campaign established a joint fundraising committee with the RNC that allowed for the campaign to take in checks in excess of $814,000.</p><p>The letter warns that “Any vendor whose clients ignore the guidelines mentioned above will be held responsible for their clients' actions,” and that “Repeated violations will result in the suspension of business relationships between the vendor and Trump National Committee JFC. This includes list rental agreements.”</p><p>The campaign has made similar requests in the past.

Roh Moo-hyun, from the liberal party, died of suicide while he and his close circle were investigated for bribery. Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye were convicted and sentenced to prison over bribery and abuse of power. Yoon Suk Yeol, the current president of South Korea, played a key role in the indictment of Park Geun-hye as prosecutor general at the time, and his achievement catapulted him to the stardom he needed to run for the presidency.</p><p>With the U.S. now facing its first criminal trial of a former president, I called up Nathan Park, a fellow at the foreign-policy focused <a href="https://quincyinst.org/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1713301995071,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82d4-d747-a9be-ced69b5e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1713301995071,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000018c-82d4-d747-a9be-ced69b5e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://quincyinst.org/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-e8c1-d3bc-adfe-f8edad4a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Quincy Institute&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-e8c1-d3bc-adfe-f8edad4a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Quincy Institute</a> and a left-leaning Korea watcher, to ask how the U.S. can learn from Korea’s long history of locking up past leaders. Park, who is critical of the current Yoon administration, discussed the consequences of prosecuting leaders, how to prevent it from becoming a political weapon and why a future president should consider pardoning Trump if he does get convicted.<br /></p><br /><p>Once lauded as victories for democracy over corruption, the prosecutions have now thrust Korea into a new and paranoid era, with government officials riddled with fears of lawsuits and criminal charges. Even worse, it makes lawmakers afraid to admit fault for fear of their apologies being used against them in court.</p><p>“On a very ground level … you can sense it from government officials that they’re freaking terrified to do anything outside of the manual,” Park says. “Everything they do is extremely defensive.”</p><p><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p><p><b>Park Geun-hye’s impeachment and conviction was seen as a democratic win at the time — but now it seems like we’re stuck in a loop of non-stop prosecution of the opposition party. What have the political implications been like since her sentencing?</b></p><p>What happened afterward is pretty unique and pretty wild. What it did was it legalized politics. Not legalized as in going from illegal to legal, but legalized as in politics became sort of lawfare. It became more about, Did you break the law? Did you not? Can you prove this in court? Can you not? And the people who are the most powerful in this lawfare are the prosecutors. What ended up happening is that the Prosecutor General — Yoon Suk Yeol — the most powerful prosecutor of them all, became the president on the strength of that. He became a political star first by prosecuting Park Geun-hye.</p><p>On a very ground level, I have been feeling — just because I do a lot of work and business in Korea — you can sense it from government officials that they’re freaking terrified to do anything outside of the manual, and everything they do is extremely defensive. Korean government used to be a very, very efficient thing relative to other governments. Now it’s still more efficient than other governments, but you can feel that the gears are slowing down a little and a lot of it is the fact that even minor officials are completely terrified of doing something that is outside of the manual and potentially prosecuted for some reason or another.</p><p>The other thing that happened is that Yoon Suk Yeol is also afraid of the same thing happening to him. So the other side of the coin is that you end up having an administration that never compromises and never admits any fault. And I think you really see that in the aftermath of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/30/world/asia/south-korea-itaewon-crowd-crush-victims.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Itaweon disaster&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/30/world/asia/south-korea-itaewon-crowd-crush-victims.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ec80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ec80001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Itaweon disaster</a>, which was this really unbelievably awful thing. And what happens is nobody apologizes, nobody resigns. They just generically say that, “Oh, we’re sorry this happened.” This is all sort of like the litigious mindset where the moment you admit fault you feel like you’re exposing yourself to a potential liability.</p><p><b>Is that because once you do expose yourself to liability, people will try to prosecute you and use that against you in court?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Yeah, because now, instead of normal politics, the expectation is that everything will be reduced to a lawsuit and indictment. So in that sense, one could argue that prosecuting leaders was a negative.</p><p><b>Do you think that politicians see prosecution as an opportunity now? Do they see the prosecution of a president as an opportunity to gain strength?</b></p><p>Oh, absolutely. In Yoon’s case, it was absolutely the direct motivation. He leveraged these prosecutions to become a political star himself.</p><p>I have a hard time imagining that this could happen in the U.S., just because of the way our justice system is structured. But imagine someone making a gubernatorial run or presidential run on the strength of being a strident opponent or prosecutor of Trump.</p><p>Or you could do it on the other side too: Someone who decides that, OK, this is going to be my star moment, and I’m going to be the next star Republican politician and try to leverage it that way.</p><p><b>We’ve now seen three former Korean presidents out of four be investigated. One died of suicide, and the other two were sentenced to prison. How concerned are you that the process has become politicized and used as a tool of retaliation?</b></p><p>I think there is a right way and wrong way of doing this. The short version is that if the legal process is rigorous and the crime seems very plain and obvious, then there is more legitimacy behind it. And the more it seems like a fishing expedition, the more it seems like, “OK, we struck out on this theory. So let’s try another theory. And another theory, another theory.” If it looks like that, that undermines democracy, because it’s starting to look like persecution.</p><p>And I think that’s what really distinguished the investigation of Roh Moo-hyun versus the investigation of Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak. The crimes of Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak were really obvious. They weren’t hard to understand. And it was pretty well established what they did in terms of a paper trail. Whereas the Roh Moo-hyun case is more like, there <a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20231129000761" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;really wasn’t any evidence connecting him directly to any bribes&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20231129000761&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ec80002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ec80003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">really wasn’t any evidence connecting him directly to any bribes</a>. And it was fairly clear that it was driven by sensationalism. And it was driven by a desire to humiliate Roh Moo-hyun.</p><p>People are not stupid, they can sense if a prosecution is driven by legitimate needs versus a desire to target somebody. And the difference is when the legal process is done in a rigorous way versus sort of this sensationalistic fishing expedition sort of way.</p><p><b>How about the post-Park Geun-hye era? I know Yoon at one point wanted to investigate the past Moon administration and has been cracking down on Lee Jae-myung, his main political rival. And in recent months, there also have been murmurs of wanting to impeach Yoon by his opponents. Do you think there’s more of a weaponization and distrust against prosecutions of politicians since Park’s conviction?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I think it’s still in flux. It’s kind of interesting, but I do think they still trust the legal system. And when someone is vindicated, then they take it seriously. Like, for example, Lee Jae-myung was in danger of getting arrested pretrial, and the judge denied the arrest warrant. And that was a big moment because in people’s minds, that sort of indicated that the criminal case against Lee Jae-myung was pretty weak. Whenever that kind of news plays out, people see that as the legal system working, it’s sorting out the people who committed crime versus people who did not.</p><p><b>Why do you think the Korean public still has so much trust in the courts, despite all the political chaos that the prosecutions of presidents might cause?</b></p><p>When you look at just the straight-on level of trust in government in OECD surveys, South Korea actually scores really low, much lower than the U.S.</p><p>My basic thesis is this: Koreans overall have much lower trust in government than Americans would. But I think that lower trust is actually the flipside of high expectations. Koreans have a high standard of what the government is supposed to do. And when you meet that standard, I think Koreans will lend a great deal of trust, regardless of the fact that their baseline of trust is rather low. I think that’s what goes on with Koreans.</p><p>And I think that works the same way as I described: If the process of prosecuting a president seems vindictive and without real standards, then it will be seen as a type of persecution. If the process of prosecuting the president meets the high standard that people set, then people accept the fact that this is how justice is carried out.</p><p><b>Donald Trump is on trial now. How does the U.S. avoid the politicization of prosecutions that has happened in South Korea?</b></p><p>I think the process should be rigorous, and there needs to be a clear distinction between people who have threatened democracy versus other categories of crimes and violations. Basically, I think that there’s a danger in this “whatabout-ism” in the sense that the attempt to end democracy on January 6 is seen as the same thing as Hunter Biden’s laptop. When you start giving both sides the same coverage when they belong to different categories altogether, I think that is what invites the legalization of politics. It incentivizes people to dig up whatever small little dirt you can dig up and say, “No, you're just as bad as we are.” So I think there needs to be a clear denunciation and clear demarcation of what is so truly offensive that it merits prosecution against the president versus not.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350968717112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><b>Who should we trust to make that distinction though?&#xa0;</b></p><p>Now I’m traveling in a more idealistic direction, but my general sense is that people are not dumb and an engaged and civil society can see this through. They can understand what’s real and what’s not as long as they’re fed good information.</p><p><b>What should the U.S. learn from South Korea as it embarks on the prosecution of a former president?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I think the prosecution of Trump has been handled well. Moving cautiously and making sure that everything as a legal matter is perfectly tied out — I think it’s very good.</p><p>In my view, it seems pretty clear that Trump’s side is the one that’s putting on this clown show. And on the other side, the prosecution is conducting themselves with professionalism. That really will be the most important thing.</p><p>The same thing happened with Park Geun-hye. Park Geun-hye’s attorneys were clown shows. Rather than trying to make a serious argument, they would show up draped in a flag and give a long speech about how everybody’s communist. She already lost credibility as a general matter, but she could not — much like Trump — get good, professional attorneys to represent her. So in the eyes of the public, she lost pretty quickly.</p><p>I also want to touch upon one thing: The fact that Korea prosecutes a lot of presidents is usually coupled with the fact that they’re pretty quickly pardoned in just a few years. There are differing opinions on this, but I sort of fall on the side that maybe it’s not such a terrible thing. There is sort of a ritualistic aspect to the law, right? You go through the process of going through a trial, being sentenced and going to prison like everyone else, and you’re not above the law. You go through this process to feel some level of catharsis but you don’t permanently alienate the people who supported that president by giving them a pardon and not letting them die in prison basically.</p><p><b>Is that something the U.S. should emulate?&#xa0;</b></p><p>It is. It wouldn’t be so terrible, especially because U.S. criminal law is relatively unique in the sense that the penalties are incredibly harsh. This is a very strong criticism I have as a criminal lawyer, that everything in the U.S. is punished with way too much prison sentence. So especially with Trump, if some of these charges stick, I don’t see him getting anything less than like a 20-year term because they’re serious charges. He’s not a young man, obviously that means he’ll die in prison. And I don’t think you want to go down that road. It would be fine for him to, for example, be convicted, maybe spend three to four years in prison. If his health deteriorates, maybe pardon him and let him at least have his final days look dignified.</p><p><b>And that’s what South Korea did with Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye, right?&#xa0;</b></p><p>That is definitely what they did, especially with Park Geun-hye. Park Geun-hye’s health was genuinely bad and she also had genuine fans that if she should die in prison, she would have been a martyr. I mean, she's already a martyr a little bit but even more so than now.<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

Then, the official said, “You know, a lot of people inside the administration ask that same question. Sometimes they ask it on the first day. Sometimes they ask it six months later.”</p><p>I have an answer for them: There is no Biden strategy for Iran.</p><p>If he wants to end the growing chaos in the Middle East, he might want to come up with one.</p><p>The Islamist regime in Tehran is, by many measures, at the root of much of the destabilization across the Middle East and more of a threat to U.S. interests than ever before. Iran is on the verge of obtaining a nuclear bomb. Its proxy militias are spreading mayhem outside its borders. It has stomped out internal revolts, and — as shown by its recent attack on Israel — the regime’s ballistic missile program is going strong.</p><p>But for most of Biden’s time as president, his aides’ No. 1 goal hasn’t been to solve this puzzle, but to keep it off the president’s desk.</p><p>“The strategy is to keep it on low boil on all fronts — nuclear, regional, whatever. That’s been the approach for some time now,” said a second U.S. official, who, like several other people I spoke to for this column, is familiar with U.S. Middle East policy and was granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350978905112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>People in Washington have good-faith disagreements on how to define “strategy,” and many use the term generically. I’ve heard plenty of policymakers grumble about how documents labeled as strategies aren’t truly strategies. But those are abstract debates that often fail to address urgent and concrete foreign policy challenges.</p><p>I’ve come to believe that if the end goal of your effort isn’t to solve a problem, then you don’t have a strategy.</p><p>So when policy wonks use words like “containment,” “de-escalation,” “deterrence” and “risk management” to describe Biden’s approach to Iran, I hear only tactics, not strategies.</p><p>He believes Iran is a problem, but doesn’t appear to have a coherent plan for how to solve it.</p><p>During Barack Obama’s presidency, the administration wanted to solve the problem of Iran’s growing nuclear program. It also had a way to reach that goal: sanctions and diplomacy combined, an effort it inherited from George W. Bush’s team.</p><p>The strategy worked, and <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/foreign-policy/iran-deal" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the Iran nuclear deal was born&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/foreign-policy/iran-deal&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ecc0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ecc0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the Iran nuclear deal was born</a>.</p><p>Many observers said the deal wasn’t good enough, and some questioned what Obama’s real strategy was about.

The attack was a retaliation for an airstrike by Israel earlier this month that killed a top general with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus. But Haass believes Tehran has miscalculated and will come to regret its decision to shift from its longtime strategy of using proxy forces in places like Syria and Iraq into launching a direct attack on civilian areas in Israel, which has only rekindled sympathy for Israelis.</p><p>“The Iranians have lost control of the narrative,” Haass says.</p><p>Haass, the author of multiple books about foreign policy, retired as president of the Council on Foreign Relations last year after nearly 20 years. Previously he was director of policy planning at the State Department under Secretary of State Colin Powell in the run-up to the Iraq invasion in 2003. Today Haass publishes a <a href="https://richardhaass.substack.com/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;weekly substack&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://richardhaass.substack.com/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ed00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ed00001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">weekly substack</a> called “Home &amp; Away.”</p><p>The question for the Middle East now is whether Iran’s miscalculation will be followed by an Israeli one.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350978905112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>“I like to quote Napoleon's dictum: When your enemies are making a big mistake, don't interrupt them,” he says. “Iran interrupted its enemy at a time when Israel was increasingly isolated and on the defensive, both internationally and in its relationship with the U.S.”</p><p><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p><p><b>With the attack by Iran, the Mideast crisis has become an even more complex situation, with a lot of moving parts. What would you be advising President Biden today?</b></p><p>I’m not sure I agree 100 percent that Israel shouldn’t respond. I think there are two big questions here. Should Israel respond? And if so, how should it respond? The Iranians essentially seem to want to say, “We’re even now, or tit or for tat.” And the president and the administration basically seem to be saying, “Okay, let’s not let things get out of hand.” So, as best I can tell, they are telling Israel at a minimum, "We won’t be with you if you do respond."</p><p><b>“You got a win. Take the win,” is what Biden reportedly told [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu in urging him not to counter-attack.</b></p><p>The only danger in that is whether deterrence has been weakened, because Iran crossed a significant threshold. The homeland-on-homeland attack was an unfortunate precedent. Which is not to say the right response would be to attack Iran’s homeland. There's a case for Israel responding in some ways along the lines of the action that may appear to have precipitated this: going after Iranian proxies, or elements of the Iranian security establishment outside of Iran. But I believe they would be wise to avoid an attack on the Iranian homeland.</p><p><b>But realistically, don't you think the Israelis, particularly a government as right-wing as this one, would view anything less than a response in kind — that is, a direct attack on Iran — as weak?</b></p><p>Certainly, there will be voices that will say that. Netanyahu will probably find himself caught, once again, between competing tendencies in his unwieldy coalition. I would argue for keeping the response very targeted. If Israel decides to act against Iran directly, I would suggest they target, for example, a factory where drones are being produced or a storage facility for drones. It ought not to be something that kills large numbers of Iranians.</p><p><b>One question is whether the Israelis may be thinking about attacking Iran’s nuclear program, which they have already targeted in various ways. Would that be appropriate?</b></p><p>The nuclear program in Iran is so distributed geographically and so protected that a response would have to be enormous. It still wouldn't destroy a significant portion of the program, though it could well set it back by a factor of months or a year or two. But the danger is that, in addition to whatever immediate retaliation would come from Iran, such an attack would provide justification for Iran going for nuclear weapons at a pace and to a degree that is not yet the case. The Iranians could say to the world: “Look, Israel is a nuclear weapons country, and they attack us with impunity. We therefore need nuclear weapons to stop that.” Attacking Iran’s nuclear program would not meet the thresholds or the criteria of proportionality, in my view.</p><p><b>It’s not clear what Tehran was trying to achieve with this attack. Was this a huge mistake by Iran, because until it happened Israel and the U.S. were on the defensive over the humanitarian issue in Gaza?</b></p><p>Yes, so much of the last 48 hours has been many of us just head-scratching over this. Why would Iran do what it did? I like to quote Napoleon's dictum: When your enemies are making a big, big mistake, don't interrupt them. Iran interrupted a situation when Israel was increasingly isolated and on the defensive, both internationally and in its relationship with the U.S., which had reached something of a nadir. At the United Nations, too, the narrative was working in Iran’s favor. Iran had so many other ways to respond effectively — perhaps using Hezbollah to militarize the West Bank or to do things elsewhere in the region. That has been the essence of Iranian national security policy for decades. So this seems to be a major strategic error on the part of Iran.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Perhaps that is what Biden was referring to — the strategic victory as well as Israel’s success in knocking down the missiles and drones.</b></p><p>Yes, the Iranians have lost control of the narrative. And even worse, they've introduced a new narrative, which like Oct. 7 casts Israel as the offended party. What Iran has done is throw Bibi Netanyahu the lifeline of lifelines that allows him to change the narrative. Now it’s about Iran — and Iran is an issue that, unlike Gaza, unites Israelis.</p><p><b>There's been a lot of self-congratulation in the last 48 hours about the effectiveness of Israel’s defense shield, with help from the U.S., and extraordinarily from Jordan as well, in shooting down 99 percent of the attack projectiles. But as I understand it, Iran deliberately did not fire off some of its best missiles. What do you make of that?</b></p><p>It was as if they were going through the motions of retaliation for what happened in [Damascus] Syria, rather than trying to really do something that would be militarily significant. I mean, it almost looks like a compromise. They didn't throw everything they had at it. It looks almost as though it was designed to fail. And then they were so quick to have their mission at the U.N. declare that this concludes things. It’s almost as though, for whatever domestic reason, they had to be seen as responding, but it was more of a political response than a military one.</p><p><b>What does that tell you? Was this about satisfying Iranian public opinion? Are the mullahs concerned about the domestic weakness of the regime?</b></p><p>It tells me that there may be differences between the IRGC and other factions. It’s quite possible the IRGC was demanding a [hard-line] response but others in Iran didn't want it to lead to an all-out conflict. Sometimes compromises that make no sense are the result of competing factions. Because again, on its merits, it makes very little sense to me why Iran didn't simply go with its normal playbook of indirect responses, perhaps targeting a Jewish or Israeli target halfway around the world. I was actually much more worried about them funneling more arms into the West Bank. That to me was a more frightening prospect.</p><p><b>Let's talk about how Biden and his administration have been handling this crisis overall. With the election seven months away, Biden’s under an extraordinary amount of pressure on the Palestinian issue. Would you say this is unprecedented?</b></p><p>Heretofore, if presidents paid a political price, it was for not being sufficiently pro-Israel. What's different now is that Biden is paying a political price for being “too pro-Israel.” So what's unprecedented is that, given the views of younger Americans — Americans of color and larger numbers of Muslim and Arab Americans — the domestic politics of the Middle East have changed. It's now become two-sided, not one-sided, which actually makes it harder for presidents. Biden is the first to learn this the hard way.<br /></p><br /><p><b>Before Oct. 7, the Biden administration was discussing normalization with Saudi Arabia but there wasn’t much attention to the Palestinians. In fact, Biden seemed to be going along with the approach of the previous administration, the so-called Abraham Accords, which basically sidelined the Palestinians. Then after Oct. 7, Biden and his team rediscovered the two-state solution, but they don't seem to be pushing that very hard.</b></p><p>There are four issues of contention with Israel and [the Biden administration] has focused mainly on two. First, humanitarian aid flows. And second, the Israeli use of military force and the lack of sufficient effort to avoid civilian casualties. But missing has been the issue of settlements on the West Bank — either land expropriation or settlement activity — and the other is the political content of a peace process. I'm largely fine with the first two. … But the real oversight, it seems to me, has not been to confront Israel on settlements and to articulate in detail what the United States believes ought to be the parameters of a political process. Of course, right now, neither Israel nor the Palestinians are [ready to negotiate a state]. But sometimes in diplomacy, you put forward ideas not to negotiate but to stimulate a process that will lead to political changes that will allow negotiations to happen.</p><p><b>Do you think that if either this Israeli government or a successor government could address the Palestinian issue, there might be reason for hope in terms of a larger Middle East peace structure — especially with the prospect of Arab normalization and so forth?</b></p><p>It's a long shot at best, but I refuse to give up on it. I’m a firm believer that it’s not just the Palestinians who need a Palestinian state, it’s Israel too. I have no illusions about the odds, and how long this could take and how difficult it would be and so forth. But I really do worry about the consequences of drift, about the idea of one-state “non-solution.” I really worry, not simply that you get a generation of even more radical Palestinians, but that it poses real challenges to Israel's Jewishness or democratic status or both. I think that's bad for Israel. I think it's terrible for the U.S.-Israel relationship. I’m not naïve, but if I could paraphrase [Winston] Churchill, I think a two-state solution is the worst possible solution, except for all the others.</p><p><b>You worked for the administration of President George W. Bush, and you left not long after the Iraq invasion in 2003. How much would you say the United States is still paying for its own errors in the Middle East going back to the Iraq war?</b></p><p>That's a good question. The principal strategic beneficiary of the Iraq war was none other than Iran. And one of the things that struck me the other day when the missiles and drones were being shot at Israel was, look where they were coming from. They were coming not just from Iran but also from Yemen and Iraq. This is the new Middle East. This is the Greater Iran. And to me, that was a reminder of how the Iraq war so imbalanced the region in Iran’s direction. So yes, we are and will continue to pay a real price for the strategic blunder that was the Iraq War.<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

None of the hundreds of projectiles launched at Israel hit a major target. </p><p>So, what was the point? </p><p>The latest crisis to erupt in the region left many longtime analysts wondering what Iran’s real intention was — whether the direct attack was mainly a face-saving exercise or a genuine effort to escalate — and whether the United States can still manage to prevent what it’s been trying to avoid for more than six months, a full-scale regional war.</p><p>Israel and Iran have been involved in a gradual, tit-for-tat escalation since Oct. 7. On April 1, the tensions worsened dramatically when Israel — retaliating for attacks on Israeli citizens allegedly orchestrated by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps along the Syrian border — destroyed an Iranian consulate building in Damascus, killing Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior IRGC commander, and seven other IRGC officers.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350970320112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, declared afterward that Israel would be “punished,” according to the state-run IRNA news agency. And the Iranian response on Saturday — a direct hit on Israel launched from Iran — marked a dramatic and very dangerous departure for Tehran, which until now has preferred to operate mainly through proxies in Lebanon, Syria and elsewhere around the region.<br /></p><br /><p>“There is a greater willingness to run risks by Iran than ever before,” said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the right-leaning Foundation for Defense of Democracies and an expert in Iran’s missile capabilities. “Until now, Iran had never directly targeted Israel from Iranian territory in an overt and attributable fashion,” said Taleblu. “The strike also was the first ballistic missile attack from Iranian territory against a defended target.”</p><p>“Iran wanted to break the taboo of targeting Israeli territory,” he said. “After being able to support the October 7 terrorist attack and orchestrate a multi-front proxy campaign against Israel and not have to pay the price, there's no doubt Tehran was tempted to press its advantage.”</p><p>Until now Tehran has signaled that it doesn’t want an all-out war, having <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/18/iran-proxies-middle-east/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;restrained its Hezbollah ally&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/18/iran-proxies-middle-east/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ed40004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ed40005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">restrained its Hezbollah ally</a> in Israel’s north from launching more than sporadic token attacks. But “Iran's government appears to have concluded that the Damascus strike was a strategic inflection point, where failure to retaliate would carry more downsides than benefits,” said Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350970702112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>At the same time, Vaez added, Tehran’s choice of weaponry was cautious. “They could have used a much higher number of projectiles, synchronized drones and missiles in a way that would have swarmed the air defense systems, and could have fired their new hypersonic missiles,” he said. “They clearly wanted something spectacular but not fatal.”</p><p>Officials said more than 99 percent of the drones and missiles were shot down and there was only one reported injury, that of a 7-year-old Bedouin Arab girl who was hospitalized.</p><p>“The matter can be deemed concluded," Iran's mission to the United Nations said in a post on social media platform X hours after the start of the operation late Saturday. "However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran's response will be considerably more severe."</p><p>U.S. President Joe Biden is now in the tricky position of persuading Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his hawkish war cabinet to restrain his response to avoid all-out war.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/d9/d8/cedcd22e499785264727cea336e6/biden-mideast-tensions-59507.jpg" /><br /><p>So far, Biden has aimed to deter Tehran by signaling that war with Israel also means war with the United States. In a statement, Biden said the U.S. military had “moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the course of the past week” in anticipation of the Iranian attack, and “we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles.”</p><p>While some Republicans called for a <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4592547-gop-senator-calls-for-us-retaliatory-strikes-on-iran/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;tougher U.S. response&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4592547-gop-senator-calls-for-us-retaliatory-strikes-on-iran/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ed50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ed50001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">tougher U.S. response</a>, even some longtime critics of Biden on the right praised the president’s careful approach.</p><p>“I have to give the Biden administration credit. They have responded better than they did when Jerusalem whacked Zahedi in Damascus,” said Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former CIA official and a Farsi-speaking scholar at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “When that happened, the White House was very quick to signal that the-Israelis-did-it-not-us; this time round, Washington ran towards Israel and has intervened on Israel’s behalf. This will induce greater Iranian anxiety.”</p><p>“Does Khamenei want to escalate against Israel? Yes. Does he want to escalate against the U.S.? No,” said Gerecht. “Unfortunately for the clerical regime, Israel is going to respond directly against it. They have to. The only open question is the magnitude. We are in an escalatory spiral that likely favors Israel more than Tehran in great part because the White House chose not to sit this out and now will be unable to change its commitment to Jerusalem.”</p><p>Even so, Biden <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/14/biden-netanyahu-u-s-wont-join-counter-strike-iran-00152130" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;reportedly told Netanyahu&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/14/biden-netanyahu-u-s-wont-join-counter-strike-iran-00152130&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ed50002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ed50003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">reportedly told Netanyahu</a> during a call on Sunday that he won’t support an Israeli counterattack against Iran. (Biden has said he would coordinate a diplomatic pressure campaign against Iran by the G7 nations.) Biden reportedly told Netanyahu, “You got a win. Take the win,” according to Axios.</p><p>Despite that, Israel’s hard-line government is all but certain to continue its habit of defying Washington and strike back at Iran directly.</p><p>Netanyahu is “a leader who simply would not want to be remembered for not having responded to a direct attack from Iran,” said Hussein Banai, co-author of <i>Republics of Myth: National Narratives and the US-Iran Conflict</i>. He added: “A U.S.-led limited counterattack might be the best option in terms of escalation control; but that would mean getting to a consensus between Biden and Bibi, which may be hard to get at this time.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pérez, who attended Berkeley as an undergraduate, is used to the political spotlight, having served for four years as the state’s Assembly speaker. In an interview, Pérez told POLITICO that the student protest at Chemerinsky’s home crossed a line and described how campus leaders can do more to push back on what he sees as a dangerous surge in campus antisemitism.</p><p><i>This transcript has been condensed and edited for clarity.</i></p><p><b>Let’s start with the protest and confrontation at Dean Chemerinsky’s home in Berkeley. Do you think that the students stepped over the line by interrupting this dinner? Did the dean or his wife, Professor Catherine Fisk, step over the line in shutting down their remarks?</b></p><p>The students overstepped the line by disrupting a purely social event at a private home that was intended to celebrate the collective accomplishments of all the third-year law students. They telegraphed their opposition by calling for a boycott [in advance of the event] — that was fine, that was completely within their rights. But they did it in a horrific way, by <a href="https://twitter.com/sfmcguire79/status/1778037351723258077" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;employing an antisemitic caricature&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/sfmcguire79/status/1778037351723258077&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ed9000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ed9000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">employing an antisemitic caricature</a> of Dean Chemerinsky.</p><p>What’s interesting is Dean Chemerinsky is a nationally renowned First Amendment expert. And even though he was offended and hurt by the caricature, he defended their right to employ it. He has been the most consistent protector of First Amendment rights of students and student protests as well as others, even when he’s the target of it. </p><p>That’s different than what the students ended up doing, which is going to the house, disrupting the event, refusing to leave when asked to leave, confronting and asserting a First Amendment right that I don’t believe they had at a private home and then asserting that they had legal representation to do it. When Professor Fisk again asked them to leave and they didn’t, and then she confronted and tried to take away the mic, I’m sure in retrospect, she wished she would have handled that slightly differently. But that doesn’t forgive the act of the students disrupting and violating the private personal space and refusing to leave when asked.</p><p><b>What should be the consequences for these students?</b></p><p>So these are my individual opinions as somebody who believes in the right to protest, somebody who’s engaged in a lot of protest on the Berkeley campus, myself, and somebody who’s deeply concerned about campus climate and creating an environment that neither stifles free speech, but also doesn’t victimize and marginalize people. </p><p>Students broadly have been put on notice that if there’s further disruptions, folks will be turned over to Student Conduct and appropriate evaluations will be made. The question becomes whether the campus decides to engage in a student conduct investigation of this and whether the students involved will say they didn’t have fair notice that this crossed the line. That’s something that the campus has got to wrestle with. And I think the campus could come to either conclusion in defensible ways. They can come to the conclusion that students could have misinterpreted this because it’s hosted by the dean as being the same as anything on campus. And the campus can also come to the conclusion that my God, these are third-year law students at one of the top law schools in the country, and that they should have a better understanding about the consequences of their actions.</p><p><b>UC Berkeley, in particular, is in the national imagination as a place of protests — during the Vietnam War in particular. Do you feel like these current protests on campus are different than protests in the past? And if so, how?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I do think they’re different. </p><p>In each of those waves of previous protests, there was a notion from students that engaging in the protest had to serve the purpose of bringing people along in an area of debate, creating space to protest, but also to change minds and bring people in the direction of the justice that they were trying to seek. But there was also a concept of consequences associated with protest. If you want protest without consequence, what you really want is performance. And I think that right now we’re seeing folks engaging in disruption, without an understanding or appreciation for what consequences can come up with it, which I think can sometimes be performative.</p><p>Second, it feels like much of the protest now isn’t, at least from my perspective, effective in trying to move debate and create space to find a new common ground that aligns with the justice that the protesters are seeking. When it’s disruption for the sake of disruption, as opposed to civil disobedience to capture attention and create space for debate, I think it serves a fundamentally different [purpose].</p><p>When you look at the Free Speech Movement, it was about creating the space for all debate, including debate that one disagrees with. What we’ve seen of late is something very different, which is shutting down debate. Last year, at Berkeley Law School, student groups passed a series of resolutions, essentially banning debate, saying that holders of “Zionist viewpoints” would not be allowed to come [to their events]. That’s very different. It’s one thing to say any given organization shouldn’t be compelled to invite somebody who has a viewpoint that’s contrary to theirs. But to say that we want to ban a whole section of debate is inherently problematic in society. It’s particularly problematic in law school, and particularly problematic in a law school centered in a place that in many ways was the birth of the free speech movement on university campuses.</p><p>There has been a horrible spike in antisemitic activity across college campuses across the country, but particularly at elite universities, and there’s been a spike in the community more broadly as well. And I don’t think that we, societally and we, as university leaders, have done enough to push back against this spike in antisemitism.<br /></p><br /><p><br /><b>You talked about these flashpoints across the country, not just at Berkeley or the UCs. Why do you think this war has lit up so intensely on these elite campuses throughout the country?</b></p><p>I don’t know. I struggle with this. One theory is that there’s been significant funding of organizations on elite campuses to push back against the policies of the state of Israel. Second, you look at a student population that is generationally different in its worldview than folks of my age. I’m in my 50s. My fundamental experiences looking at the state of Israel are different than somebody in their 20s. Somebody in their 20s has grown up with an Israel that’s been disproportionately governed by the Netanyahu government, and a government that has been more conservative. Somebody of my age would’ve seen a variety of different expressions of leadership in Israel. I think it’s allowed for a certain shorthand that I think is ahistoric. </p><p>I think you can be, as I am, a supporter of the existence of the state of Israel and the ability of Israel to defend itself and a critic of the current administration leading Israel and the policies of the administration. You can be a critic of government there just like you can be a critic of government here. So I could be a critic of a Trump administration and a supporter of America, somebody else can be a critic of the Biden administration and still a supporter of America. We don’t seem to have a generational ability to afford that same duality with respect to viewing Israel.<br /></p><br /><p>But it goes further than that. What we’re seeing is stuff that we saw in the Chemerinsky caricature, which goes back to old antisemitic tropes — blood libel with respect to the way they depicted Erwin with the bloody knife and fork — and a sense that we’re holding all Jews accountable for anything that we find problematic with respect to the situation [in Gaza] unless and until they actively renounce and reject Israel. That’s really problematic. It really goes against all of the standards of community that we have. </p><p>If it was any other group, we wouldn’t do it. We’re not seeing on college campuses, attacks and questioning every student of Russian heritage because we take issue with the Putin administration, and what they’ve done in Ukraine and other places around the world. We’re not seeing where we’re attacking every Muslim student, because we take issue with what Hamas did on Oct. 7. One can debate the space between anti-Zionism and antisemitism. But one would have to have serious blinders not to recognize that what’s happening on college campuses, UCs included, is a series of activities that are targeting Jewish students because of their identities, making them feel unsafe and apart from the rest of the community in a way that really should have no place in our society and no place on our college campuses.</p><p><b>But we have seen spikes in incidences of Islamophobia and anti-Arab sentiment, too</b><i>.</i></p><p>Absolutely.</p><p><b>Are you saying that the antisemitism we’re seeing is disproportionate?&#xa0;</b></p><p>The antisemitism is absolutely disproportionate. We reject both. We reject all forms of hatred. But what we’re not seeing is massive student protests targeting every Muslim-identified student, asking students of Muslim or Arabic background to denounce or renounce something that they have no part in. The numbers and the spikes are vastly different, and the types of incidences are vastly different. </p><p>I was on the Los Angeles City Human Relations Commission, I think I was president at the time in 2001 when 9/11 happened. We immediately came together and said, ’how do we avoid an irrational targeting of Muslim members of our community in the wake of the response to 9/11?' Now that said, we saw spikes in anti-Muslim activities, Islamophobic activities. That was problematic and offensive. And we've seen some of that now, and we have to speak out against that.</p><p>It’s interesting to me that the only time where we have to do this both sides-y rejection is when the victims are Jewish. When we saw a spike in anti-Asian hate crimes over the last couple of years, there was no immediate pushback that said, now you have to reject these other forms [of hate]. In fact, after George Floyd, when we were talking about Black Lives Matter, there was a clear distinction that if you responded by saying, “All Lives Matter,” that yes, that’s true that all lives matter, but if you were doing it reflexively you are denying the real pattern and problem of what was happening in the African American community. So we’ve got to be careful in that we should be able to have a conversation about the spike in antisemitism, the very clear expression of antisemitism, without then having to do a litany of [denouncing other forms of hate in order] to renounce the antisemitism.</p><p><b>There are a number of California campuses, including three UC campuses — Berkeley, UCLA and San Diego — that at the moment are under investigation by the federal Department of Education in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks because of discriminatory incidents. What can you tell us about where those investigations stand?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I can’t tell you anything about where those investigations stand. I’m not fully read in on the moment to moment of the investigations. And to the extent that I know anything in the middle of an investigation, it would be inappropriate for me to comment.</p><p>But at a certain level, there’s got to be a gut check. When you look at something, does it look right? And then can you go and figure out a way to confirm that your inclinations are correct, and that you can create defensible policies based on that? It was right that you asked about the 1960s in the Free Speech movement, and the antiwar movement. We’re 60 years later. We should have learned from 60 years. How do we adjust in real time? On many college campuses, there’s been such an orthodoxy around the First Amendment that there hasn’t been enough debate about how it exists in conflict with these other protections. </p><p>Let me give you an example of where I think students broadly would say the First Amendment should have limits — sexual harassment. We know that we can regulate certain speech that is, in fact, sexual harassment. At what point does the First Amendment come into conflict and into tension with other sets of laws and other protections? Again, I’m not a lawyer. I’m not a constitutional scholar. But there’s some basic common sense questions that are asked.</p><p><b>Another question around these free speech issues is directly on your plate as a regent.

It’s largely been seen as a response to faculty groups posting critical statements of Israel and its conduct in Gaza. That vote has been delayed twice.</b></p><p>Who’s the person that moved to delay the votes?</p><p><b>It was you.</b></p><p>It’s an important area of debate and there hasn’t been enough work to land in the right place. And this does cut to the core of who we are. We shouldn’t have unreasonable restrictions on speech. And that speech can take many forms including posting on websites. When the first policy came forward, I didn’t think enough work had been done. So I moved to put it off. And this last one, I don’t know if I made the ultimate motion to put it off or not, but I think I did, again, because there’s more work.</p><p>Any regulation has to be content neutral. What I did say at the last meeting is the timing of it makes the action suspect. Had we done this a few years before, without the current tension, it would be less suspect than it is right now. Now, college campuses have free speech zones. Public buildings have places where free speech is and is not allowed. I think it’s reasonable to say that as we move to a world that significantly exists and people interact with online, you can make distinctions between places where you have official business versus opinion. It’s appropriate. Newspapers have editorial and opinion pages and letters to the editor. Websites don’t do as good a job, in my opinion, of moderating comments, but there’s a distinction between editorial space, news space, opinion space. I think it’s reasonable to try to find that distinction if it’s 1) content neutral, and 2) provides an equally accessible way to access people’s opinions.</p><p><b>I’d like for you to put on your jersey as a lifelong Democrat for a moment. You know that a crucial part of your party’s coalition depends on young people. When you see the intensity of the reaction to the Israel-Hamas war on campus and the criticism that Biden is getting for how he’s been handling this, does that make you worried for November?&#xa0;</b></p><p>You’ve seen the Biden administration’s view and interaction with Israel evolve in real time based on real circumstances. Biden, who has a lifetime record of having a very positive relationship with Israel, has also been trying to hold the Netanyahu administration accountable and pushing back. Is that enough to satisfy the critics? Of course not. It’s appropriate to have tension. But in the end, elections are about choices. This is going to be a question about Biden versus Trump. Students, like everybody else, need to look at the totality of everything that they’re offering as candidates and I think that young people will once again overwhelmingly vote for Biden.</p><p><b>That sounds to me like you’re not very worried.</b></p><p>No, no. I’m worried. But I’m also hopeful. This doesn’t happen magically. It happens by having conversations, by engaging voters, by talking to voters, by looking at what’s at issue. It’s not enough to say, “Hey, young people are going to be so offended by what Trump is doing on abortion..." You have to speak to the concerns that they’ve articulated. <br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350278288112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><b>You’re Mexican American and grew up with deep ties to the Jewish community in east L.A.

Does it concern you that these two communities that you have been so much a part of seem to have a fraying relationship?</b></p><p>It worries me that Americans writ large are becoming more isolationist. There’s not only an interest in us playing less of a role in the conflict in the Middle East, but there’s a spike in folks wanting us to play less of a role in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. But yes, it bothers me that there’s less of a connection between communities that have historically been connected. But Latinos exist in the same world that everybody else does. Latinos are a disproportionately young community — younger on average than just about any other ethnic group. And young people have grown up with 20 years of the Netanyahu administration that they increasingly take issue with. </p><p>Latinos also are horrified by what happened on Oct. 7. Absolutely horrified — by murder, by rape, by torture, by kidnapping. Part of the problem with a poll is what question you’re asking. What does cease-fire mean? Does cease-fire mean a temporary cease-fire, does it mean an effort at sustainable peace? I’m somebody who’s supportive of cease-fire. It can’t be unilateral. It doesn’t work that way.</p><p><b>Putting the polls aside, do you sense a fraying in the relationship between Jews and Latinos?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I think there’s a little fraying in the relationship but what I think we’re seeing is a national spike in antisemitism and it expresses itself in every community. Latinos don’t exist in a bubble. And there has been a persistent rise in antisemitism. And it goes unchecked in ways that discriminatory actions against other communities do not go unchecked.</p><p>When somebody on a college campus targets a Muslim student for identity, targets a Muslim woman for wearing traditional garb, there is offense taken and a pushback. The same isn’t expressing itself when we’re seeing antisemitic acts. At the last Regents meeting, protesters erected an effigy, in violation of policy, of a bloody pig holding a cage, bags of money and [it] said “UC regents time is running out.” Protesters came and took over the Regents meeting and the room was cleared. I think three of us stayed in the room to listen. Nobody took the opportunity to speak to the three of us. It was just chants. And the chants weren’t about a policy, the chants were about Jews. They were about Jews. It wasn’t about this university policy or that university policy, it wasn’t even that the regents need to divest. It was about Jews. It was antisemitic.</p><p><b>What were the chants?&#xa0;</b></p><p>“We've got to go after these Jews.” “We got to stop the Jewish lobby.” It was very clear.</p><p>We have gotten to a point of both sides-ism in this question, which is completely not constructive. When I go around to different college campuses, I tend to meet with a cross section of students and faculty. I have only in my 14 years on the board been challenged once about trying to meet with a group of students. And it was trying to meet with a group of Jewish students on a campus where there have been efforts to target their Hillel. The campus told me that if you meet with Jewish students, you have to meet with the Muslim students. I said, “I’m meeting with students at Hillel because Hillel was targeted.” There’s no balancing that needs to happen. If you asked me to meet with Muslim students because I’m on campus, I’m happy to do it. But it can’t be because I’m meeting with Jewish students. When I go meet with Latino students, I don’t have to go balance that by meeting with somebody else. When I go meet with LGBTQ students, I don’t have to balance that with meeting somebody else. When I go meet veteran students that are dealing with the complexity of coming back after having served and navigating a college campus, I’m not told you now have to go meet with another group. The only time it’s ever happened was in one instance trying to meet the Jewish students. It shouldn’t be the case.</p><p><b>Anything else you’d like to add?</b></p><p>I take all of this personally. I take it a little more personally at a UC because I have responsibility for UC. I take it a little more personally still at Berkeley because it’s such an important part of my life experience. Berkeley is the first place where I ever experienced a Ramadan. Berkeley was the first place I ever meaningfully engaged with the Muslim student community and navigated making sure that we were an inclusive campus for Muslim students. As you mentioned, I have a clear, very personal tie to the Jewish community. But that’s not an exclusion of a tie and an interest in the Muslim community. Having a deep connection to one community doesn’t mean that there’s not a concern and care for another.<br /></p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

References to America’s past litter his public remarks, and the portraits of historical figures like Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan that hung in his office on Capitol Hill were frequently mentioned in his stump speeches. A riff where he discussed the reproduction of <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11417" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>Washington Crossing the Delaware&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11417&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ede0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ede0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>Washington Crossing the Delaware</u></a> in his conference room was so often repeated that it became a punchline in McCarthy world. Joe Biden has his Scranton roots, Donald Trump has his border wall and Kevin McCarthy has Emanuel Leutze.</p><p>Six months after his <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2023/10/03/congress/mccarthy-out-speaker-conservatives-oust-boot-00119732" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>ouster as speaker of the House&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2023/10/03/congress/mccarthy-out-speaker-conservatives-oust-boot-00119732&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ede0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ede0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>ouster as speaker of the House</u></a>, McCarthy is trying to write his <i>own</i> history. Although still comparatively young at 59 in an era of octogenarian politicians, it’s hard to imagine a world in which the first line of his obituary is not that he was the first speaker ever removed from office. So now, McCarthy seems to have set himself to the task of shaping how future generations remember that moment and the eight months he spent wielding the gavel — even if it requires a selective retelling of what happened with a few big omissions.</p><p>This past Tuesday, McCarthy brought his effort to shape his legacy to a windowless auditorium on the campus of Georgetown University for an event called “How Strong Is Our Democracy? With Kevin McCarthy.” If the name of the event is any indication, he wants to be remembered as someone who buttressed American democracy during his time in public service.</p><p>In the late-arriving crowd of around 100 students, one could see the full range of those who would stay inside on the first warm spring night of the year to listen to a retired politician. There were those clad in suits who sat close to the stage to listen while others were busy multitasking, working on assignments or playing word games with their laptops open.</p><p>After the customary introduction, McCarthy, along with former Democratic operative and current Georgetown professor Mo Elleithee, who served as the interlocutor, sat down on the stage and began the program with polite jokes before asking the former House speaker why trust in democracy was so low in the United States.</p><p>Even at an event about the strength of American democracy, there was little urgency in how McCarthy spoke. At a time when both Democrats and Republicans — for very different reasons — warn that “democracy is on the ballot” in 2024, he didn’t seem to have that level of concern about the stakes. Instead, McCarthy offered a broader critique of modern American politics that mixed platitudes about media and the fragmented state of the two main parties with a healthy dose of whataboutism offered in a friendly, self-deprecating manner. He mourned the siloing of how Americans consume media. “You can go home, and you get your news from an outlet that philosophically agrees with you” that offers opinion rather than reporting, he said. “You have social media that's providing something very quickly. There's no editor in charge of what somebody says.”</p><p>And when he had to specifically apportion the blame, McCarthy tried to strike a pose as detached from partisanship as possible for someone who spent the past half decade <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/2022-midterms-kevin-mccarthy-is-the-man-in-the-maga-middle.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>leading a political party in Congress&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/2022-midterms-kevin-mccarthy-is-the-man-in-the-maga-middle.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ede0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ede0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>leading a political party in Congress</u></a>. For him, the failed lawsuit to throw Trump off the ballot in Colorado and the suppression on social media of the story of Hunter Biden’s laptop were threats just as real as January 6 — an event he took pains to condemn. “What happened on January 6 was wrong; I don’t apologize for anyone who did it,” he said. But it was a critique of those who stormed the Capitol, not those, including Trump, who spent months egging on MAGA loyalists to do so. He bemoaned the increase in partisan politics in Washington. It could have been out of the No Labels handbook, save for the fact that he only blamed Democrats and of course the member of Congress he holds most responsible for his ouster, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).</p><p>He conflated Democratic election denialism and Republican election denialism as he waxed on about what he described as Democratic efforts to overturn past presidential elections, ranging from the hanging chads of 2000 to comments Hillary Clinton made about the 2016 election, before finally addressing his vote against the certification of the 2020 presidential election in Arizona and Pennsylvania.</p><p>McCarthy argued that his vote was simply about expressing some concern over procedural changes during the Covid pandemic rather than any desire to change the result of the 2020 presidential election. It was part of the normal cut and thrust of politics. In contrast, he argued, the Democrats were the ones who tried to overturn elections.</p><p>“The one point I would raise to you is, those who questioned the race when George Bush won challenged Ohio. Had they been successful, Bush would not be president,” said McCarthy, referencing an effort after the 2004 election by a handful of congressional Democrats without the backing of John Kerry to protest voter irregularities, including long waits, for many voters in the state. In contrast, McCarthy argued, “had Republicans who challenged the 2020 race been successful in their two challenges, Joe Biden would still be president. He just wouldn’t have the same electoral votes. A challenge doesn’t mean you’re overturning something. A challenge is a challenge.”</p><p>That wasn’t quite the whole story. Trump allies had initially planned significantly more challenges than just to the electoral votes of Arizona and Pennsylvania, including Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin. This <i>would</i> have been sufficient to overturn the election. However, the number of challenges was pared back after the debate on the first challenge was delayed for 10 hours due to the violent invasion of the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.</p><p>McCarthy also offered his defense of the infamous picture of him with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in the weeks after Trump left office. The visit was viewed as a dramatic boost to the former president’s political fortunes in the immediate aftermath of his second impeachment trial. For McCarthy, this was just supposed to be a quiet visit to a friend going through a tough time.</p><p>As McCarthy described his philosophy of friendship: “Whether I like you or dislike you, if something bad happens in your life, I want to be the first person to call you. … The first thing that happens when something bad happens, [is that] everyone abandons you. I want to call you. … I just want to know how you’re doing as a person.”</p><p>In the former speaker’s telling, he just happened to be in Palm Beach for a fundraiser when he got a call asking him to visit Trump. McCarthy turned down dinner but said he could “come by for lunch.” But then, 30 minutes later, the<i> New York Times </i>knew about the visit, which was supposed to be private. As McCarthy said, “I didn’t tell my staff.”</p><p>(In former Rep. Liz Cheney’s 2023 book, <i>Oath and Hono</i>r<i>, </i>she said McCarthy told her that he went because Trump “wasn’t eating”: “They’re really worried,” McCarthy said. “Trump’s not eating, so they asked me to come see him.”)</p><p>McCarthy then recounted a conversation where Trump quizzes him immediately after sitting down together for lunch. Trump asks the following questions to McCarthy:</p><p>“Did you leak it?”</p><p>“Did your staff leak it?”</p><p>“Do you think my staff leaked it?”</p><p>Each time, McCarthy answered in the negative.</p><p>Finally, the former president asked him ‘Who do you think leaked it?’”</p><p>McCarthy replies “You” to laughter in the room of Georgetown students. Then, in the former speaker’s telling “[Trump] looks at me, and he goes, ‘Well, it’s good for both of us, you know.’” As he was telling the story, McCarthy shrugged, eliciting even louder laughter from the crowd.</p><p>The faux-intimate revelation of these private conversations added to McCarthy’s appeal to the crowd. What went unremarked was how simply resigned McCarthy apparently was to the fact that Trump leaked the story and the sense that dealing with the former president was more akin to managing a tantrum-prone child and a political ally — after all, McCarthy once infamously presented the then-president with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kevin-mccarthy-relishes-role-as-trumps-fixer-friend-and-candy-man/2018/01/15/a2696b4e-f709-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>handpicked Starburst candies&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kevin-mccarthy-relishes-role-as-trumps-fixer-friend-and-candy-man/2018/01/15/a2696b4e-f709-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ede0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ede0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>handpicked Starburst candies</u></a> to ensure that he only received his favorite flavors.</p><p>Yet for all the emotional support that McCarthy may have provided after Trump left office, the former president also left McCarthy dangling when he was ousted as speaker. This, too, went unmentioned.</p><p>He was diplomatic when asked about more controversial parts of Trump’s record. “I didn’t know that he had a fake electors scheme,” McCarthy said when asked about the former president’s actions in the immediate aftermath of the 2020 election. When asked about Trump’s references to immigrants poisoning the blood of our country, McCarthy said “I’ve never heard him say that.” He added eventually, “I don’t think that’s what President Trump believes in my time around him. Never heard it.” Trump has repeatedly used the phrase in recent months, including in a March interview on Fox News.</p><p>And as for his ouster in 2023? At one point, he asked, “Want another inside story?” to the crowd, after which he reiterated a familiar complaint that Democrats had betrayed him by supporting the effort. He also blamed the vote as driven by the bad-faith efforts of Gaetz. Gaetz, <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/04/09/congress/mccarthy-on-gaetz-00151412" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;u>he said, had a vendetta because McCarthy&lt;/u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/04/09/congress/mccarthy-on-gaetz-00151412&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ede000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ede000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>he said, had a vendetta because McCarthy</u></a> did not “stop an ethics complaint because [Gaetz] slept with a 17-year-old.” (The Justice Department dropped its investigation into Gaetz for sex trafficking in 2023, and the Florida Republican has denied having a relationship with a minor.)</p><p>It was all part of a tale that put the best spin possible on his political career.</p><p>At least at Georgetown, McCarthy’s act worked among a crowd where many experienced Trump’s first election before they experienced puberty. The ambitious students all were hesitant to use their names with the typical caution of online undergrads. One junior from Connecticut leaving the event clutching a bag of Sour Patch Kids found McCarthy, “actually really funny, very personable guy.” A Democrat, she said “she didn’t have a lot of expectations” from the event and was just curious to hear the “other side of the aisle’s thoughts going on in Congress and his personal experience.”</p><p>Another sophomore from California, leaving the event in a Zach Bryan t-shirt, also left with a more favorable opinion of McCarthy. He described himself politically as “center-left leaning” and said that while he didn’t agree with McCarthy’s politics, he thought that what the former speaker said about “different people having different experiences and you have to understand that was important.”</p><p>A single event at a college campus won’t determine what goes in the history books. McCarthy held an event the following night at Harvard Kennedy School — this one was called “The 2024 Election, Trump, and the Future of American Democracy” — which went very similarly to the Georgetown event; at times, McCarthy repeated himself word for word. Eventually, they add up. History is a slippery thing, and the way in which figures are enshrined in historical memory constantly changes. Heroes often turn to villains, and sometimes, villains even turn into heroes.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine what values Americans will hold in the 22nd century or if they will even know Kevin McCarthy’s name.</p><p>A House Republican colleague sniped to me last year that all McCarthy cared about was whether he’d become speaker and have his portrait hung in the speaker’s lobby alongside all of his predecessors. But it’s clear he cares about more than that. It’s not just that the portrait is there but that someday, someone will think it will be worth hanging in their office, too.<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

But on Monday in New York, the “hush money” case is set to begin. And Cohen is the star witness — the man who paid Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump. Trump then reimbursed Cohen and, as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleges in his 34-count indictment, falsified records about those payments to “conceal criminal activity.”</p><p>Trump’s defense is simple: You can’t trust Cohen.</p><p>So what does Cohen have to say on the eve of the first criminal trial of a former president, someone who happens to be his one-time boss and mentor?</p><p>A lot.</p><p>I talked to Cohen on Thursday for this week’s episode of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839?i=1000652234879" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1712928099248,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000152-8eed-d275-addf-bfff4c8f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1712928099248,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000152-8eed-d275-addf-bfff4c8f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839?i=1000652234879&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-d278-dd93-a19f-fffa76360000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Playbook Deep Dive podcast&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-d278-dd93-a19f-fffa76350000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Playbook Deep Dive podcast</a> just after he had learned that Trump had attacked him on Truth Social, possibly violating a gag order that Cohen says must finally be enforced.</p><p>Together, we discussed how he will defend the assault on his credibility at the trial, why Bragg’s case is stronger than analysts believe, the legal tactics he’s expecting from Trump’s team, whether he ever regrets breaking with Trump and what Daniels’ tarot cards predicted about the outcome of the case.</p><p><i>This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.</i><br /></p><br /><p><b>I've heard you say that people are wrong when they say that this is the weakest of the four cases against Trump. Tell me if I've got that right?</b></p><p>What I've said consistently is that for whatever the reason might be, the American public treats these four indictments like it's the Kentucky Derby. Everybody's handicapping and picking and choosing which one is the most offensive and violative of law.</p><p>I will concede right now that the January 6th insurrection is more grotesque in terms of illegal behavior than this specific case — campaign finance, hush money, we'll call it business record fraud. That's what I prefer to call it: the "business record fraud" case.</p><p>Then you have the failure to return top-secret documents, showing them to people who do not have proper clearance to see [and] that places America's national security in jeopardy. Yes, that is more abusive towards the law than the campaign finance-business record fraud case. And I will even turn around and say that the Fani Willis case — attempting to overturn a free and fair election [in Georgia] — is more of a grotesque abuse of the law than the Alvin Bragg case. Nevertheless, the campaign finance — the business record fraud — is a crime, and if it was you or anybody else, they would already have been indicted, the case would have already proceeded and chances are they would have already been convicted and sentenced.</p><p><b>Trump's defense is going to be to paint you as an untrustworthy witness. He's going to cite your guilty plea for lying to Congress, and the fact that the Justice Department declined to offer you a cooperation deal because prosecutors thought you lied to them. And he'll say you're out for revenge and that you have a financial incentive to see him convicted. So how do you defend yourself from those accusations?</b></p><p>I wish that when people state that “you lied to Congress,” that you’d do me the courtesy — do <i>yourself</i> the courtesy — of finishing the sentence. What is the sentence? That I had done that, really, for the benefit of Donald J. Trump. And that lie centered around the number of times that I had stated that I spoke to Donald about the failed Trump Tower Moscow real estate project — in conjunction with other lawyers Jay Sekulow, Abbe Lowell, Ty Cobb, with other individuals like Alan Garten or Ivanka [Trump] and Jared [Kushner]. Everybody worked on that statement. I was just the fool who went ahead and read it into the record and submitted it. But what benefit did I have in terms of saying three times versus 10? That's the lie: That I claimed to have spoken to Donald <i>three</i> times about the failed Trump Tower Moscow real estate project, when the true answer was 10.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6350787543112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><b>I appreciate you putting it in context. With these other accusations, is that the way you approach it: You put those things in context for the jury so that they understand them,&#xa0; and what sounds like a dramatic allegation can be defanged?</b></p><p>Absolutely. There is a ton of misinformation, disinformation, malinformation that has been put out there by Trump and acolytes literally since the Steele dossier. We all know that the Steele dossier was completely inaccurate, as it related to me. I don't even talk about any of the other allegations raised in that garbage document.</p><p><b>I remember when we were all asking you if you went to …</b></p><p>I've never been to the Czech Republic. I've never been to Prague. As soon as I had gotten out of Otisville [Correctional Facility], I was contemplating on going there and taking photos and tweeting out: "Glad to be back in Prague."</p><p><b>Credibility is one part of this trial. </b><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/11/trump-alvin-bragg-trial-win-00151558" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;b>The other c-word that comes up is \&quot;corroboration.\&quot;&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/11/trump-alvin-bragg-trial-win-00151558&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ee30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ee30001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>The other c-word that comes up is "corroboration."</b></a><b> And that's something that you and Lanny Davis, your adviser and attorney, talk about a lot: that there will be corroboration. What can you tell us about that? Is this a stronger case when it comes to corroboration than people understand on the outside?</b></p><p>If it wasn't, Alvin Bragg and his team of prosecutors would never have brought this case.</p><p><b>Do you think we'll be surprised by it — by some of the corroborating evidence?</b></p><p>I do.</p><p><b>Okay. In other words: We don't know everything that's going to be presented?</b></p><p>In fact, most people don't really know anything. They only know what the headlines have been. And as you know very, very well, headlines do not necessarily tell the story.</p><p><b>One of the big obstacles seems to be how Bragg connects the misdemeanor of falsifying business records that recorded what were actually hush money payments — the payments to you to reimburse you for the payments to Stormy Daniels — to another crime that Trump was trying to commit, which then makes this a felony. That’s sort of the gist of the case. Do you think Bragg has strong evidence on that portion of the case?</b></p><p>Let me say it to you this way — it may not be satisfying to you, and I do certainly appreciate the attempts to drill down despite me telling you I cannot go into into this case: Alvin Bragg would not have brought this case — he would not have that as an element of this case — if he did not believe that he would be able to prove this at trial to a jury of 12.</p><p><b>Michael, your case may end up being the only case that goes to trial this year — meaning that you are<i> the</i> key witness that will determine whether Donald Trump goes to jail before the 2024 election. What is it like having that sort of weight on your shoulders?</b></p><p>It's a heavy weight. It's a weight that is difficult, on a daily basis, to carry around. I wish I wasn’t involved in this at all. Not that I don't want to see accountability; it is incredibly taxing on your heart, on your mind and on your soul. I can tell you from a physical and a health standpoint, since this all started coming down, I'm down 22 pounds.</p><p><b>You look great, by the way.</b></p><p>I look horrible. I'm at the same weight now that I was at when I was released from the 51 days of solitary confinement as a result of an unconstitutional remand against me, weaponized by [then-Attorney General] Bill Barr and Trump to go against his critics. So it's just a side note to those people who don't believe what Donald says, whether it's during these rallies or these ridiculous statements that he makes. Trust me: I've been there. I know what he's intending to do, and he's not bluffing.</p><p><b>Let me just be clear about this, because I think there's some people who think that solitary confinement is a form of torture and should be banned: When you say “solitary confinement,” describe what you mean and what that was like.</b></p><p>I was put into a cell that is approximately eight feet by 10 feet, and it is a toilet, a sink, a locker, a bed and a chair with a desk that's attached to the wall. And you sit there for 24 hours, seven days a week. It's not like you see in “Shawshank Redemption” or any of those movies where you’re out in the yard and able to shoot hoops for an hour. Every now and then, they let you go grab your meal, but then you come right back. The only time you were out was Monday, Wednesday and Friday for 15 minutes to take a shower, or twice a week for a five-minute phone call to your family. My cell was by far the worst of all. The window was broken. It was missing a piece of plate glass. When it would rain, it would rain in on me. During the day, it’s about 100-plus degrees, 105 degrees in that cell, with no ventilation. The flies would come in. The sink was broken. The toilets were broken. The facility in and of itself was filthy. That’s what solitary confinement was for me.</p><p><b>Based on what you know about Trump, what do you think a second Trump term would be like?</b></p><p>In 2018, when I testified before the House Oversight Committee, I predicted before anybody that my biggest fear was that if Donald loses the 2020 election, that there will never be a peaceful transfer of power. Those were my words in 2018. And sadly, it became a reality.</p><p>I’m going to give you my next prediction: If, God forbid a million times, Donald wins the election in 2024, there will never be another election again in America. Because Donald believes, like Putin, that it doesn’t matter who you vote for; all that matters is who’s counting the vote. So there might be this <i>impression</i> of an election, but it will never be a legitimate election ever again. He has no intention of being another one-term president. This, for him, is presidency for life.</p><p><b>On the flip side of that, if this prosecution is successful and ends with jail time, what do you think that would do to the country? And do you think that’s a real possibility — that Donald Trump could end up in jail based on this case?</b></p><p>That's up to the 12 jurors and of course, to the way that both prosecutors handle the case and defense is able to represent Trump on his position. I can’t tell you what will happen or what won’t happen. I’m not the great Carnac; I don’t have the crystal ball.</p><p>I don't believe that Trump is going to win this election. I believe that as a result of his taking credit for the overturning of<i> Roe v. Wade</i>, he has angered a group of America — specifically women in America and those men that support women for women’s reproductive rights — and I think that that’s just one of the very stupid things that Trump, the GOP, MAGA, has done.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/1f/0a/e8c8b1d349fd8c696f612836396a/trump-fraud-lawsuit-72449.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Do you think Trump wants to testify?</b></p><p>I think he’d like you to believe that he would.</p><p>It would be worse than the deposition he gave at the E. Jean Carroll trial case, where he couldn't even recognize that E. Jean Carroll was not his ex-wife, Marla Maples. Donald does not know how to tell the truth. He's lied so many times that he cannot keep track of the lies. And one lie begets another lie. He would be putting himself into a perjury trap by taking the stand.</p><p>He'd be a horrible witness. You guys would all enjoy it because it would give you so much to talk about. "Saturday Night Live" would pay Donald to get up on the witness stand; they wouldn't have to write anything for then maybe the next three, four episodes.</p><p><b>Give us a sense, on the eve of this trial that starts on Monday, just mentally where you are and how you're preparing for this.</b></p><p>Well, my preparation is really just looking over some of the old testimony that I had given. Remember: It goes back to 2018. So it's really just more of a review. My story has not changed. It's just very repetitive.</p><p>I'm not the defendant in this case. The defendant in this case is the former president, Donald J. Trump. So what does he do? He starts to attack. And despite the gag orders that have been put on by the judges, he nevertheless continues to do what he wants. He will say whatever he wants. He violates the gag order. And like a petulant child, there appears to be no repercussion. He legitimately just posted something calling me a sleazebag. And of course, he attacked Stormy Daniels as well. It's called witness intimidation and obstruction of justice.</p><p><b>Will you be asking the court for sanctions and for the judge to enforce his gag order, which does allow for sanctions?</b></p><p>I don't have the right to make that call. That call has to be made by the prosecutors.</p><p>I don't want to testify. I have been extremely clear about it. I have already testified before the Mueller team. I've testified before seven congressional committees. I've testified to the New York attorney general. I've been part of grand jury indictments. You know, now I'm supposed to again testify before the Manhattan D.A. case. I'm not asking to be a witness, let alone be referred to as a “key” witness. I am a non-party subpoenaed witness. My intention is to comply with this subpoena, though I would prefer not to.</p><p><b>Fair. Do you want Bragg to ask Judge Merchan to enforce it, after Trump attacked you?</b></p><p>Well, I think they should — specifically so as to ensure that the case, once it starts on Monday, operates in a respectful manner and one that does not place witnesses — myself included — in harm's way.</p><p><b>You're ready to testify Monday morning, but you just don't know yet when they're going to call you?</b></p><p>There's no chance in the world that I'm testifying on Monday. The process starts with what's called voir dire. That's where they're going to impanel the 12 jurors with the two alternates.</p><p>They are going to pull out every stop they can to try to demonstrate to the judge that they can not get a fair jury — that they can not get a fair trial here in New York. And that way, somewhere down the road, they're going to once again make another motion claiming that they need for Judge Merchan to be recused, that they need the venue to be changed because Donald is afforded, under the Constitution, the right to a fair trial. That's their next move. It will not work.</p><p>Let's say 30 days is what it will ultimately be before the jury gets impaneled. I'm not even expected to be one of the first witnesses. I'll probably be more like in baseball: clean-up. I'll be like a fourth or fifth batter. They're going to keep me on that stand for as long as they possibly can, trying to discredit me. So that way, they can use that to try to make a case during appeal, why this case should not stand, and have it overturned.</p><p><b>You and Stormy Daniels have struck up an unlikely friendship after all you went through. And I know that she's done tarot card readings for you. Did she do a tarot card reading about this case?&#xa0;</b></p><p>She did do a tarot card reading for me when she was on my "Mea Culpa" podcast. I don't specifically remember all of the things that she said, but she turned around and she said that the cards show that Donald will be held accountable.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6349671517112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p><b>The jury questionnaire had a question that asks the jurors, “Have you ever listened to any podcasts by or read any books by Michael Cohen?” Suggesting that this is going to be a little bit of an issue. Do you ever regret your sort of media empire that you’ve built? Do you think it has complicated this case?</b></p><p>Well, I appreciate you calling it an empire. Am I upset about the fact that I have done as much media as I have? Absolutely not. Because if it's not me who's speaking and trying to inform the country — not just Democrats, but Republicans and most importantly, the independents, the undecideds — if it's not me, who is it going to be?</p><p>The easiest thing for me to have done early on, when all of this mishegoss was going down in my life, would have been to keep my mouth shut. I probably would have been the first person that Donald pardoned. And I'd probably be working for Fox News, Newsmax. I'd be the head of the RNC, probably, with Lara Trump, or something stupid like that. But I would be putting America's democracy — I'd be putting my children's future and your children's future — in jeopardy. And I wasn't going to do that.</p><p>I can't tell you the number of fellow inmates that would say to me all the time: "Why didn't you just keep your fucking mouth shut? Keep your mouth shut, you'd be the first one pardoned. You would be working right now making millions of dollars with the Republican Party. Instead, you keep fighting him."</p><p><b>In the back of your mind, do you ever think this really wasn't worth it?&#xa0;</b></p><p>I think about everything. I think about the day that Donald asked me to come to work for him. I didn't need to work for him. I was semi-retired. I was 39. I was set; I got lucky early on. I was finally getting a chance to enjoy time with my wife, my children. Unfortunately, I’d just come off of a terrible health issue that almost took my life. And so being sort of sedate, I was looking for something that would have given me some activity that would spark my entrepreneurial spirit again. I like to be busy. And Donald, when he made that offer to me, fit that exact set of parameters.</p><p>That was 2007. He made me one of the three members of the board of Miss Universe. It was Donald, Allen Weisselberg and me — that's not the greatest of company. I was co-president of Trump Productions; he had the number-one TV show at the time. I was working on real estate projects, including one … where we would have built an entire city, literally right before entering New York through the tunnel, with 10,000 apartments. I was given this great responsibility: I was <i>personal attorney</i> to Donald J. Trump. And he was not the Donald Trump that you see today. Donald today is the worst version of himself imaginable.</p><p><b>Explain that transition. What do you think has made him more of a caricature of himself in terms of the way that you're describing him?</b></p><p>Power. The old adage "absolute power corrupts absolutely"? That should be written on his epitaph one day.</p><p><b>You've talked about and written that it was Jared Kushner and Don Jr. that convinced Trump to throw you under the bus. What would have happened if he hadn't listened?</b></p><p>Chances are he may not be in the position that he's in right now because I may not have come clean. I may not have provided the information. I may not have been able to emotionally break away from the cult and acknowledge — despite the ongoing continuous harassment of my wife, my daughter and my son — that I need to snap out of this, that your loyalty belongs to us and the country.</p><p><b>Who do you think Donald Trump will pick as his VP?</b></p><p>Guaranteed it'll be a woman, because he is right now so deep down into the dumpster when it comes to women that he needs to show that he's not the sexist misogynist that he is. And I think if he could find a woman of color, that would be better. But he won't do it. I see somebody like a Nancy Mace or maybe even [Sen. Katie] Britt, because of their looks.</p><p><b>That's important to Donald Trump?</b></p><p>Very, very. He believes in optics. It's almost like why he would walk and he'd have Hope Hicks right by his side, shoulder to shoulder. He believes that everyone is sort of as mentally corrupt as he is, and he's visual. So like with "The Apprentice," him coming off the helicopter with 30 beautiful women following behind him? He thinks it makes him look bigger and more important.</p><p>So I do believe it will be a woman. I believe that, in his mind, he will consider her to be attractive. He also needs somebody who will not outshine him. That's why somebody like a Nikki Haley could never be the choice. She's too strong a person and she would suck up some of his oxygen in the room. And for Donald, owning all the oxygen in the room is what he constantly needs. It's what keeps him going.</p><p><i>Listen to this episode of Playbook Deep Dive on </i><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;i>Apple Podcasts&lt;/i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playbook-deep-dive/id1111319839&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ee30002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ee30003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>Apple Podcasts</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0YmkWN5cyxuqBh5Vl78yGp" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;i>Spotify &lt;/i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/0YmkWN5cyxuqBh5Vl78yGp&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ee30004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ee30005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>Spotify </i></a><i>or wherever you get your podcasts.</i><br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

But it’s far from the only example. Over the past year, in ways large and small, in criminal cases and civil ones, Trump has consistently been given more freedom and more privileges than virtually any other defendant in his shoes.<br /></p><br /><p>Some judges in Trump’s cases may have afforded him unique leeway in hopes of avoiding any appearance that they are meddling in the 2024 campaign. Indeed, Trump’s role as a presidential candidate — one who is always eager to play the martyr — complicates the task of prosecutors and judges eager to lower the temperature of the proceedings. Penalizing Trump before he’s ever convicted of anything could stir a backlash and trigger more heat, not less.</p><p>Trump supporters surely bristle at the notion that he’s getting any preferential treatment. After all, he is facing dozens of felony counts across <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2023/trump-criminal-investigations-cases-tracker-list/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;four criminal cases&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/interactives/2023/trump-criminal-investigations-cases-tracker-list/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4eeb000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4eeb000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">four criminal cases</a>, and a series of massive civil judgments has damaged his reputation and his wealth.</p><p>But the fact is that no other person in America — if charged with the diverse panoply of malfeasance that Trump has been accused of — would enjoy the same procedural and structural advantages that Trump has harnessed, to great effect, as his legal troubles reached a fever pitch over the past 12 months.</p><p>There may be good reasons for some of those advantages. A former president and current candidate is no ordinary criminal defendant. But special treatment carries a hefty price: It shatters the American lore that everyone is treated equally before the law.</p><p>The result, ironically, is a partial confirmation of one of Trump’s favorite grievances. He’s enmeshed in a “two-tiered system of justice,” he often says — and he’s right. There are two tiers.

But the authorities made special accommodations that largely spared Trump from the byzantine, often humiliating procedures that thousands of other defendants endure every day. He was not handcuffed. No mug shot was taken. Rather than sitting in a holding cell for hours while waiting for a judge, Trump was whisked through the courthouse and then released on his own recognizance.</p><p>Over the next six months, Trump was indicted in three more cases: two (in Washington, D.C., and Georgia) for trying to overturn the 2020 election, and one (in Florida) for storing classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after his presidency and obstructing the government’s efforts to get them back. The arraignments in those cases largely followed the same choreography.

The Secret Service, for one thing, would never allow one of their most prominent protectees to spend the day in Central Booking.</p><p>But these special concerns point to a deeper reality that has pervaded Trump’s yearlong odyssey through the criminal justice apparatus: The system was never designed to handle a defendant who is a former, and perhaps, future president.

And then there’s New Jersey. </p><p>In the Garden State, Katyal — the Beltway-famous legal combatant against Trump-era assaults on democratic norms — has thrown himself into a very different legal battle: He’s working to restore a voting rule that enables machine-politics bosses to stack the ballot against anyone they don’t favor. A federal judge last month declared the system unconstitutional for the upcoming primary. Now Katyal’s admirers say they’re enraged by their erstwhile ally’s efforts to snatch away their victory. </p><p>“We are all amazed and disappointed and all the related words,” said Yael Niv of the Good Government Coalition of New Jersey. “He’s on the wrong side of history.” </p><p>Steven Fulop, the mayor of Jersey City and a 2025 Democratic gubernatorial hopeful, told me that “It certainly seems like he’s done a 180 with regard to who he’s fighting for today.” </p><p>Staci Berger, a dissident member of the local Democratic organization in Middlesex County, put it this way: “It’s inappropriate for someone who positions themselves as an advocate for democracy to engage in something that’s abetting voter suppression. … It’s a contradiction and it’s hypocritical.” </p><p>That’s not the sort of reaction typically engendered by Katyal, an acting solicitor general in the Obama administration. With a popular podcast, an MSNBC gig and an active practice arguing crucial cases before the Supreme Court, he’s one of the capital’s most celebrated lawyers — a brilliant litigator and eloquent media presence whose public brand is built on protecting the guardrails of the republic. </p><p>Last year, after Katyal successfully argued against a right-wing effort to gut election oversight, the esteemed judge Michael Luttig said Katyal delivered “the single best oral argument I have ever heard made before the Supreme Court of the United States,” and called it “the single most important constitutional case for American democracy since the nation’s founding.” <br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/53/09/b69275544b5a9050399495f465b2/capitol-riot-investigation-38311.jpg" /><br /><p>No one is likely to ever apply that description to the current litigation over New Jersey’s “county line” ballot system. A one-of-a-kind historic vestige, the system lets local party organizations — the polite term for Democratic or Republican county machines — give their favored candidates top billing on primary-election ballots while consigning everyone else to a kind of ballot-design purgatory. According to <a href="https://www.njpp.org/publications/report/does-the-county-line-matter-an-analysis-of-new-jerseys-2020-primary-election-results/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a 2020 study&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.njpp.org/publications/report/does-the-county-line-matter-an-analysis-of-new-jerseys-2020-primary-election-results/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ef30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ef30001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a 2020 study</a>, being on the line gives machine-approved pols a jaw-dropping advantage in primaries. It also serves to scare off a lot of candidates who might challenge the insiders. </p><p>Democracy advocates have long derided the rule as something out of a banana republic, “an unconstitutional governmental thumb on the scale,” in the words of New Jersey Rep. Andy Kim, the Democratic Senate candidate who filed suit against the “fundamentally unjust and undemocratic” system in February. </p><p>When Kim’s lawsuit prevailed on March 29, it represented a political earthquake in the state — and set off impromptu celebrations among activists who’d fought the system for years and couldn’t quite believe they’d won. </p><p>But instead of joining the celebrations, Katyal joined the other side, filing an amicus brief last Saturday on behalf of the Middlesex County Democratic Organization, one of the state’s venerable local machines. </p><p>Katyal declined comment, saying he was busy preparing for arguments in a gun-control case in San Francisco this week. But his filing does not strike the high notes that might be familiar to those who read his anti-Trump book or watched his successful Supreme Court evisceration of the “independent state legislature” doctrine that could have allowed state legislatures to overturn election results. </p><p>Nonetheless, the brief makes a coherent argument for the old status quo: The line system, Katyal writes, “makes voting more efficient by allowing primary voters to easily identify and quickly vote for all candidates belonging to a single political organization or affiliating with a single slogan.” According to the brief, it’s about protecting “low-information” voters: “Only political junkies learn enough about each primary candidate to make an informed choice about who should be their party’s nominee for Surrogate, township council, or County Clerk.” </p><p>It’s an argument that draws scoffs from attorneys who fought to kill off the system. </p><p>“New Jersey’s primary ballots are a rigged national outlier that offer preferential treatment to certain candidates over others, creating systemic disadvantages that nudge voters, discriminate against candidates and alter electoral outcomes,” said Yael Bromberg, the lawyer representing Kim and a pair of other office-seekers in an effort to forbid the system. “It is one of the last vestiges of machine-style politics in New Jersey, which gives us the unfortunate moniker of the Soprano State.” </p><p>As for the idea that it helps those who haven’t had time to vet the field of candidates, she told me: “They essentially claim that they have a constitutional right to gerrymander the ballot.” </p><p>A federal appeals court may decide soon enough: Arguments are scheduled for April 12 in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, located in Philadelphia. With elections looming, there’s a lot of pressure for a quick decision because ballots need to be printed. </p><p>Alas, the appeals court won’t weigh in on what might be the most interesting aspect of the case for Washington types: Just why would Katyal sign on to a cause that, whatever its legal merits, looks so tawdry and backward? For someone who is genuinely admired in the capital’s legal and media ecosystem, it’s off-brand, to say the least. </p><p>When I reached out, Katyal steered my legal questions to his partner Sean Marotta, who is also working on the case at the Hogan Lovells law firm. Marotta did not respond. Katyal also didn’t respond to a follow-up email about the activists who said they were disappointed to see a pro-democracy ally joining the case on the other side. </p><p>In fact, Katyal wouldn’t be the first superstar political attorney to disappoint his non-lawyer fans. There’s a long history of legal powerhouses earning plaudits for taking cases in the public interest while paying the bills by representing less sympathetic clients. David Boies, for instance, won liberal hearts by leading Al Gore’s recount efforts in Florida in 2000 and going to court for same-sex marriage — and then broke them by playing the heavy on behalf of convicted rapist movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and Silicon Valley fraudster Elizabeth Holmes. <br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/32/a4/84325c02411482751d314686747f/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/51570463" /><br /><p>Katyal himself has never claimed to be a resistance hero, whatever his admirers may want. On social media, he describes himself as an “extremist centrist.” He testified on behalf of the Supreme Court candidacy of Neil Gorsuch. And his choice of clients has caused backlash before. In 2020, he represented Nestle and Cargill in a case involving allegations of child slavery — and he won, successfully arguing that the firms shouldn’t be sued in the U.S. for alleged atrocities that took place in West Africa. </p><p>But what’s different in the county line case is that the subject matter of Katyal’s New Jersey brief is the exact same as the topic of his pro-democracy heroism. Ordinarily, a famous attorney’s public-spirited work (say, getting some poor innocent off death row) concerns a different legal arena than the grubby stuff the same lawyer does to make money (for example, representing an environmental despoiler). With Katyal, his star turn in last year’s independent state legislature showdown and his controversial appearance in the county line litigation both involve the battle to ensure free and fair elections. </p><p>Thus Katyal, who literally represented the good-government group Common Cause in last year’s Supreme Court elections case, finds himself supporting something that the very same organization blasted this week. “When party bosses are able to tip the scale to try to favor certain candidates over others, it distorts voters’ perceptions of who’s running for office and can potentially silence their voices,” Aaron Scherb, the group’s legislative director, told me. “We need a level playing field to ensure that voters can choose candidates based on the merits.” </p><br /><p><br />In Washington, the whole spectacle reflects a tension that has played out in the establishment ever since Donald Trump’s defeat: Was pushing back against election subversion just about thwarting Trump? Or is it part of a larger effort to improve American democracy — a cause that might also include killing a bipartisan New Jersey system that long predates the 45th president? </p><p>In New Jersey, it raises a less cosmic question: Just how is a measly county party organization paying for his services? Katyal charges <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/jj-bankruptcy-trustee-balks-neal-katyals-2465-hourly-rate-2022-05-23/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a reported $2,465 an hour&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/jj-bankruptcy-trustee-balks-neal-katyals-2465-hourly-rate-2022-05-23/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ef40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4ef40001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a reported $2,465 an hour</a>, making him one of America’s priciest legal talents. Forty hours at full freight would cost nearly $100,000. It wouldn’t take long, in other words, to eat through the entire bank account of the Middlesex County Democratic Organization, which had just under $360,000 in cash on hand at the time of its most recent financial report in January. </p><p>The organization declined requests for comment about both its stance on the county line and the financing of its legal team. </p><p>“When your entire business model is at stake for the county parties, of course you will hire a high-profile D.C. attorney to fight your battle for you,” said Antoinette Miles, the state director for the Working Families Party, which filed a previous suit against the county line. Her group works to help progressives win Democratic primaries, an outcome that’s much harder under the county line system. But Miles said the real reason the machines were so eager to preserve the system was about money, not ideology. “Party operatives are looking at this and saying, ‘If I don’t have the party line then how will I maintain my municipal contracts?’” </p><p>In a weird way, money could also be at risk for Katyal — at least the smaller kind of money that comes from book sales and talking-head deals. Along with her own brief in the county line case, Berger, the dissident Middlesex County committee member, forwarded me something that might be more worrying to Katyal’s media agents: A furious letter her mother had sent to MSNBC. The Massachusetts retiree wrote to complain that her favorite network’s legal analyst was defending a “horrendous” practice. </p><p>“Although you have no control over his professional legal career, to me it reduces his credibility,” the letter read. “I am a regular viewer of MSNBC and respected his stance on various legal matters. … His defense of this archaic ballot causes me to reconsider his positions on liberal and/or progressive issues.”</p><br />]]></content:encoded>

And it would make it easier for Trump’s lawyers to argue at a sentencing hearing, if that day comes, that the former president should be given probation instead of prison time.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6349671517112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>“Yes, the answer is 100 percent” that Trump’s team should pursue this strategy, said the person familiar with Trump’s legal strategy.</p><p>That may be the rational thing to do, but Trump, of course, does not like to be seen as weak and he does not concede defeat.

Instead, the public will have to rely on the coverage of people like Jeffrey Toobin, the veteran court reporter and ubiquitous cable news legal analyst who — along with a small cadre of court reporters and professional legal analysts — will be shuttling back and forth between the courthouse and cable studios to bring firsthand accounts of the trial to the country.</p><p>Toobin knows the intricacies of this courtroom-to-cable dance better than most. After getting his big break covering the O.J. Simpson trial in 1995, Toobin has reported on some of the splashiest and most high-profile trials and investigations of the past three decades — including Bill Clinton’s impeachment, Martha Stewart’s insider trading trial and Robert Mueller’s Trump investigation — for the <i>New Yorker</i>, where he served as a staff writer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/business/media/jeffrey-toobin-fired-new-yorker.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;until 2020&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/business/media/jeffrey-toobin-fired-new-yorker.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f050003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f050004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">until 2020</a>, and as CNN’s legal analyst, a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/media/jeffrey-toobin-leaves-cnn/index.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;role he held&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/media/jeffrey-toobin-leaves-cnn/index.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f050005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f050006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">role he held</a> until 2022 though he still appears regularly on the network.</p><p>Recently, I spoke to Toobin on a video call about the intricacies of covering blockbuster trials, how Trump’s trial might measure up to O.J.’s and whether court reporters should tailor their coverage to the unprecedented circumstances of Trump’s trial. “Trump presents a unique challenge,” Toobin told me. “It’s one thing to be a famous football star. It’s another thing to be president of the United States.”</p><p><i>The following has been edited for clarity and concision.</i></p><p><b>In terms of pure spectacle, how do you think this upcoming trial will compare to some of the other blockbuster cases you’ve covered?</b></p><p>You have to draw a distinction between televised trials and non-televised trials, because there is almost no way the public can become truly obsessed by a trial unless it’s televised. Take a case like <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2011/07/suddenly-new-york-musters-its-obligatory-outrage-about-casey-anthony-000134" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Casey Anthony&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2011/07/suddenly-new-york-musters-its-obligatory-outrage-about-casey-anthony-000134&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f060000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f060001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Casey Anthony</a> — which, as you know, was a very sad case, but not a case of great national significance — but it became a huge phenomenon because it was televised. And what’s his name? — Zimmerman — who killed, uh …</p><p><b>Trayvon Martin?</b></p><p>Right, Trayvon Martin. Florida has Sunshine laws [that require most public proceedings to be open to the public], so a lot of the big cases have been in Florida.</p><p>The Trump case is not televised, but it is of vast national importance, so it will be followed very carefully. The big difference now between prior non-televised trials and current non-televised trials is Twitter, or X, or whatever you want to call it. You will have multiple outlets essentially covering this trial in real time on Twitter, and the <i>New York Times</i> will be doing a version of that with its live feed. That’s a big improvement over just listening to the likes of me summarize a day’s development. It’s not as good as is watching it yourself, but people will be able to follow the Trump trial minute-to-minute in a way that was never possible with other non-televised trials.</p><p><b>Does that give an advantage either to the prosecution or the defense?</b></p><p>Gosh, I don’t think so. I mean, I’m prepared to hear an argument one way or another, but it certainly doesn’t occur to me.</p><p>To me, the huge issue in this case — well, there are lots of issues — but one of the really big issues is jury selection. I would say 85 percent of the American public has strong feelings about Donald Trump, and 95 percent of the people who live in Manhattan have strong feelings about Donald Trump, so teasing out those feelings and picking a jury that can be fair is going to be a tremendous challenge.</p><p>One of the things that we as journalists think is, <i>Oh, everyone is following this case so closely, that you’ll never get an unbiased jur</i>y. But I think we overstate how much people actually follow the news. I’ve covered O.J. Simpson, Martha Stewart, Michael Skakel, Timothy McVeigh, and people are vaguely aware, but they really don’t follow the news as closely as we do. But Trump presents a unique challenge in that regard. It’s one thing to be a famous football star — it’s another thing to be president of the United States.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/40/a5/d9e335d146cd8e01c5a4722deced/election-2024-trump-45378.jpg" /><br /><p><b>You’ve </b><a href="https://www.theringer.com/2017/4/17/16043544/jeffrey-toobin-interview-oj-simpson-donald-trump-new-yorker-cnn-d53af53cece2" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;b>said that&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theringer.com/2017/4/17/16043544/jeffrey-toobin-interview-oj-simpson-donald-trump-new-yorker-cnn-d53af53cece2&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f060002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f060003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>said that</b></a><b> what made the O.J. trial so popular was that it combined all the things that every American is secretly obsessed with: sex and violence and race and celebrity.</b></p><p>And the only eyewitness <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/07/02/witnesses-tell-how-nicole-simpsons-dog-led-them-to-her-body/82c11ef0-4de5-4d89-ba99-131eb349e425/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;was a dog&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/07/02/witnesses-tell-how-nicole-simpsons-dog-led-them-to-her-body/82c11ef0-4de5-4d89-ba99-131eb349e425/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f060004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f060005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">was a dog</a>.</p><p><b>Right, and the only eyewitness was a dog. Do you think the Trump trial has those same ingredients, minus the dog?</b></p><p>I think the Manhattan D.A. is going to do [his] best to downplay the salacious aspects of the trial. This is a case that the Manhattan D.A. feels is mostly a document case. It’s a case about pay-offs by check that were reimbursed by check and that were misreported on official documents. Now, it happens that the original check was to a porn star, so that obviously is just a fact about the case. But I think the two sides are going to have very different motivations in portraying the sexiness of the case. I think the defense is going to try to make this look like the D.A. is just tarring Trump with an extramarital affair with a porn star — it’s just character assassination, not a crime. The prosecution is going to say that this is all about keeping relevant information from voters on the eve of the 2016 election.</p><p>All that being said, you’re gonna have to get there pretty early on the day that Stormy Daniels testifies if you want to see it — so let’s not kid ourselves.</p><p><b>How important is it to you to be in the in the courtroom?</b></p><p>It depends on what I’m doing. If I’m going to write a book, it’s very important. If it’s more episodic coverage, it’s certainly important to be there at least sometimes, because you can never get a true sense of any trial without seeing the jury, without seeing how the lawyers interact, without seeing how the judge is behaving.</p><p><b>Can you walk me through your game plan on days where you’re covering the trial? What does that look like?</b></p><p>The most important thing I think about is do I have a seat? Again, judges and administrators have dealt with these differently. At the O.J. trial, I had half a seat, and I split it with another writer. I consider it one of the great good fortunes of my life that I won the coin flip to be in the courtroom for the verdict, and you can see a very young-looking Jeff Toobin sitting behind the Goldman family in the famous shot of the verdict. Sometimes it’s a matter of just getting there very early. Sometimes it’s a matter of working with your news organization to decide who has the seat on this day. But the logistics of being in the courtroom preoccupy a lot of my time when it comes to a case like this.</p><br /><p><br /><b>Let’s talk a bit about some of the journalistic questions surrounding this trial. We’ve been through so many of these boom-and-bust cycles with Trump, where legal experts hype the merits of the latest case, it doesn’t play out, everyone who opposed Trump is briefly disappointed, and then we move on.</b></p><p>You’re talking to someone who <a href="https://www.amazon.com/True-Crimes-Misdemeanors-Investigation-Donald/dp/0385536739" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;wrote a book about the Mueller investigation&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/True-Crimes-Misdemeanors-Investigation-Donald/dp/0385536739&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f060006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f060007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">wrote a book about the Mueller investigation</a>, which is now a footnote in the history of the last decade.</p><p><b>Precisely. So is this case any different?</b></p><p>I don’t want to speak for anyone but myself, but I view my role as explaining what’s going on in the courtroom and putting it in the context of the broader legal case against Trump. It is not my job to say that, you know, Stormy Daniel’s testimony will cost Trump Michigan. The way I can add value as a journalist is to tell the story of this case, and I will leave it to others to make highfalutin claims about the larger significance and the political implications.</p><p><b>Do you feel any pressure — either stated or unstated — to skew your analysis in a predictive direction, given the audience of cable news at this point?</b></p><p>You know, I have often said on the air that the three words you’re never allowed to say on cable news are “I don’t know,” and I think those are valuable words.</p><p>I do think it is fair to ask someone like me, <i>How is the prosecution’s case going? What are Trump’s likely chances of success on the Supreme Court in the immunity case?</i> In that respect, it’s fair to make a good faith attempt at answering those questions about the future, and I don’t feel any political pressure to come out one way or another. But I do prefer to answer questions about the past rather than the future.</p><p><b>You said in </b><a href="https://www.theringer.com/2017/4/17/16043544/jeffrey-toobin-interview-oj-simpson-donald-trump-new-yorker-cnn-d53af53cece2" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;&lt;b>an interview&lt;/b>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theringer.com/2017/4/17/16043544/jeffrey-toobin-interview-oj-simpson-donald-trump-new-yorker-cnn-d53af53cece2&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f060008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f060009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><b>an interview</b></a><b> a few years ago that when you were covering the O.J. trial, you understood your role as being a neutral explainer of the law, but over time, you were expected to take on more of a voice and have more of an opinion on a given case. Is that a salutary development in your mind?</b></p><p>I think all of journalism, including cable news, has become more voice-y and people are freer with their opinions. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? I think it’s more good than bad. Obviously, it can be abused, but when you have a case like Trump claiming that he could never be prosecuted for any crime he committed while he’s president, I think it is good journalism to say that that claim is so outlandish that it’s unlikely to succeed in the Supreme Court. I don’t think you’re doing news consumers a favor if you pretend that all arguments are equally likely to succeed. So in that respect, I think it’s good that you can express your opinions a little more, as long as they are based in evidence and not in political predisposition.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/94/68/6b711a8e407fabf081eab28dd20a/trump-hush-money-30738.jpg" /><br /><p><b>Do you think that’s the M.O. among most of the cable news commentators these days?</b></p><p>I think my colleagues who cover court cases make good faith efforts to sort out successful arguments from unsuccessful arguments. I think the more you move into more purely political voices, you see more motivated conclusions and more wish-casting rather than predicting.</p><p><b>Another critique you sometimes hear of the coverage of Trump’s legal issues is that the focus on the minutia of the legal challenges distracts from some of the larger political questions posed by Trump, with the result that the mainstream media develops this sort of this fixation on the courtroom as the arena in which Trump is going to be finally vanquished. How do you think about that?</b></p><p>I think that, to some extent, that question is above my pay grade. I try to do a good job of putting each development in context, and it’s the nature of news that it’s on every night, even though the news is not equally important every night. But I think that, particularly in a trial like this, it’s important to remember that there is going to be weeks of testimony, and what seems important on one day may be nearly forgotten when it comes time for summation. Trying to sort out what seems significant on an individual day and what ultimately becomes significant — I mean, it’s part of my job, but I don’t want to pretend that I have a foolproof detector.</p><p><b>Has that experience of covering the Mueller investigation — when, as you said, you wrote a whole book about what is now essentially a footnote&#xa0;— has that changed your approach to Trump’s trial?</b></p><p>One of the things that we have learned about Donald Trump is that he is at least somewhat impervious to the kind of investigation that many of us thought sunk political candidates in the past. And what’s been especially interesting to me in the lead-up to these trials is how often Trump goes to court. He doesn’t have to go to all these pretrial proceedings, but he obviously feels that being in these courtrooms is helpful to his political campaign, which is not something I think most of us would have predicted.</p><p>There were many people who thought that Mueller was going to bring down the Trump presidency, and one thing we know for sure is that he didn’t.</p><p><b>Were you one of them?</b></p><p>You know, I don’t know what I thought at any given point. I mean, I certainly thought it was a very important investigation — I wouldn’t have written the book about it otherwise — and I thought the issues raised were very serious. But I can’t tell you that I thought that he was going to be forced out of office.</p><p><b>I guess my broader question is this: If the courtroom is, in some respects, the campaign, do the norms and approaches of the courtroom journalist need to change to reflect that reality?</b></p><p>That’s a great question. [<i>Long pause.</i>] This is a non-cable-news length pause — you can’t think this much on TV. [<i>Another long pause.</i>]</p><p>I guess my immediate reaction is that I don’t want to change the norms of what I do — but I also want to limit the importance of what I do. I am not the voice of anyone but myself in terms of what the importance of the trial is, and there are going to be many voices [debating that]. It is my strong preference to cover the Trump investigation and the Trump trial not as a metaphor or a political campaign. I recognize that reasonable people might see it differently, but I have a more modest sense of my own importance.</p><p><b>Maybe overly modest, given that you helped set the conventions of what a cable news analyst is. It seems like your opinion on these things carries some weight.</b></p><p>My opinion in general is that less is more. Explain what’s going on in the case, rather than talk about the cosmic or political significance of what’s going on in the case.</p><p><b>If you could snap your fingers and change one thing across the board about how the institution of the cable news analyst functions today, what would it be?</b></p><p>Well, I would start by putting more cameras in courts and letting viewers make up their own minds about what’s going on in courtrooms — and I’d start with the United States Supreme Court and work my way down. I think it’s great that we now at least have live audio of the Supreme Court, which we didn’t until the pandemic, but I think it’s a tremendous disservice to the public that Donald Trump’s trial is not on television. I mean, that that’s just it, you know, we live in a country where the default judgment should be to let the public see what’s going on. It’s a public courtroom. It’s not like it’s a secret.</p><p><b>So in an ideal world you would be irrelevant?</b></p><p>I would be less relevant, yeah. Court proceedings have their own language, and they need a certain amount of translation from people who are familiar with them — but yeah, I think it would be better if the public were getting more direct evidence of what’s going on rather than having it mediated by people like me.</p><p><b>Well, I guess I’ll judge the success or failure of that mission by how often I see you on TV in the coming weeks.</b></p><p>Yeah, well we’ll see. We shall see.<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

The cherry blossoms are stunning, the stock market is booming, and Tokyo’s Haneda airport is chockablock with foreign tourists.</p><p>The bad news is a pervasive sense of insecurity among Japan’s business and political elite. Being flanked by three aggressive nuclear-armed neighbors — China, Russia and North Korea — is bad enough; now comes the prospect of Donald Trump recapturing the White House.</p><p>Japanese scholars have long recognized a strain of fatalism running through their culture — one that, today, views the return of Trump almost like the earthquakes which have plagued the archipelago for centuries: destructive and perhaps inevitable. As in Europe, Japanese policymakers are determined not to be caught unawares a second time around. “Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst,” explained a top businessman.</p><p>The truth is that we are already living in a “Trump 1.5” world. Despite multiple civil and criminal charges, the ex-president is exerting extraordinary influence over current U.S. policy. Having swept to the Republican presidential nomination, he is calling the shots on Capitol Hill on issues ranging from the stalled Ukraine military aid package to the blocked Mexican border bill.</p><p>Conventional wisdom is that Europe would bear the brunt of Trump 2.0 foreign policy. His distaste for the EU trade bloc is well documented. He believes, with some justification, that Europe (particularly Germany) has long enjoyed a free ride — drawing the benefits of the NATO security umbrella without paying their dues.</p><p>Some of his anti-NATO rhetoric may simply be a way to shake down deadbeat allies. But any wavering on America’s commitment to NATO’s Article 5 mutual defense clause would reverberate all the way to Asia. Japan is not a member of NATO, but as America’s closest ally in Asia, any hint that it could no longer rely on its 72-year-old bilateral security treaty would be devastating.</p><p>It is not only Kyiv, London or Paris that worries about a Trumpian dirty deal to end the Ukraine war. Any agreement which appears to reward Russian aggression would, in Japanese eyes, encourage China in its own territorial ambitions. Taiwan is the obvious target, with some Japanese military experts warning privately that Chinese President Xi Jinping is likely to “do something” before his third term expires in 2027. (An economic blockade or a partial occupation of the Kinmen islands next to Taiwan are viewed as credible alternatives to a high-risk amphibious invasion of the main island itself.)</p><p>Japan’s worst fear is being caught up in a conflict over Taiwan, though it stands ready to defend itself (with U.S. support) if its own territory comes under attack. The wider fear is that the subjugation of Taiwan would merely be the first step toward China pushing America out of the west Pacific. The Japanese know what the U.S. military thinks about that prospect, but they have little notion of what is going through the mind of Trump the Dealmaker.</p><p>As regional tensions rise, Japan has responded by pledging to double its defense spending over the next five years. It is drawing closer to South Korea, overcoming decades of mutual hostility going back to the Second World War. And it is moving toward more robust deterrence, notably through developing a next generation fighter jet with the UK and Italy and new missile “counter-strike” capability. Joining the AUKUS grouping with Australia, the U.S. and the U.K. is also on the table.</p><p>But many questions remain about whether Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party-led coalition government can meet its spending commitments. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s approval rating has tanked (thanks to a party funding scandal) and he may have to call an election this fall. Kishida is also hobbled by his peacenik coalition partner Komeito, which will challenge every effort to interpret more liberally the constitutionally mandated “self-defense” clause covering Japan’s armed forces.</p><p>On the economic front, Trump 2.0 is equally discouraging. Tokyo has still not gotten over Washington’s refusal to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership regional trade agreement. That pass was sold by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election campaign and enthusiastically endorsed by Trump himself. Since then, the TPP has morphed into the Regional Comprehensive Economic Agreement, which includes China with no U.S. counterweight. Instead, America First has become embedded in U.S. trade and industrial policy, latterly through President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act which has subsidized U.S. companies to the tune of billions of dollars. Biden has kept most of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods, but he did remove Trump’s tariffs on Japanese steel. Trump, on the other hand, has promised that his second term trade policy would be even more aggressive than his first.</p><p>Over the past few years, Washington and Beijing have been severing their economic ties. Trump 2.0 would continue this trend toward “conscious decoupling,” forcing European and Asian allies to choose between the two powers. Japanese companies, which for two decades and more have heavily invested in China to take advantage of cheap labor costs, will have to adjust accordingly. Many have already done so, moving operations to lower-cost facilities in Thailand and Vietnam.</p><p>During my five-day trip to Tokyo, I attended a meeting of a new global think tank — the merger of the International House of Japan (I-House) established by John D Rockefeller III to repair U.S.-Japan ties after World War II and the Asia Pacific Initiative, set up by Yoichi Funabashi, the former newspaper editor, author and national security expert.</p><p>In 1929, Rockefeller visited Tokyo as part of a U.S. delegation to meet Japanese counterparts to discuss the crisis over Manchuria, the mineral-rich Chinese province long coveted by Imperial Japan. In the end, the talks went nowhere and Imperial Japan seized Manchuria, the prelude to a savage military expansion across south-east Asia which led to Pearl Harbor and the cataclysm of World War II.</p><p>Funabashi, an old friend, is not the only scholar or bureaucrat in Tokyo pondering whether we are indeed hurtling back in history to the 1930s, as Robert Kagan warned recently in The <i>Washington Post</i>. A return to high tariffs, anti-immigrant xenophobia, rampant nationalism and American isolationism — all of which prepared the ground for the outbreak of war.</p><p>On a more optimistic note, he wondered aloud whether there was a chance of “Biden 2.0” where an aging president scrapes out a victory against Trump, faces down the Democratic Party’s left wing and reverts to the center for his second term.</p><p>Biden 2.0 may, of course, turn into Harris 1.0 — an equally unpredictable prospect. Either way, my old friend Yoichi has some recommended bedtime reading: E.H. Carr’s <i>The Twenty Years' Crisis, 1919-39</i>.<br /></p><br />]]></content:encoded>

Wade</i> nearly two years ago created a patchwork — and ever changing — landscape of abortion access in the United States, with roughly a third of states prohibiting the procedure in nearly all circumstances. That includes almost all of the southeastern United States, after a recent Florida Supreme Court ruling triggered a six-week abortion ban in the state that will take effect May 1 and cut off a key regional access point for the procedure.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a 160-year old aw outlawing abortions at any stage of pregnancy unless the patient’s life is in danger, with no exceptions for rape or incest. That decision could take effect as early as the end of May, though it is unclear how, whether and when the law will be enforced.</p><p>And ongoing litigation in other states, such as Nebraska, Iowa and Utah, could mean more changes to state abortion laws this year.</p><p>Abortion-rights groups are also pushing this year to pass constitutional amendments that would protect abortion access in states like Montana and Nevada and overturn abortion bans in Florida and Missouri.</p><p>Explore the map and table below for more on each state’s abortion laws:<br /></p><br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

Once the full panel is selected — which could happen by the end of the week — the trial will enter its next stage: opening arguments and the presentation of evidence. The jury will decide whether Trump is guilty of having falsified business records to mask a hush money payment to a porn star who claimed she had a sexual encounter with him. Prosecutors say the cover-up in the final weeks of the 2016 election deprived voters of important information about Trump’s conduct with women.</p><p>Other jurors sworn in Tuesday are a man originally from Puerto Rico who works as an IT consultant, a Harlem woman who works in education and a software engineer who lives in Chelsea.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351055597112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>The seven Manhattanites were selected from an initial crop of 96 prospective jurors who began the jury-selection process on Monday afternoon. Dozens of people were dismissed from the pool outright when they told the judge, Justice Juan Merchan, that they could not be impartial. Others were dismissed after further questioning — with some removed by the judge himself and others removed by the prosecution or defense teams, each of which are entitled to strike a small number of prospective jurors without giving a reason.<br /></p><br /><p>The trial will break on Wednesday and resume Thursday morning with a new batch of prospective jurors.</p><p>In a fitting move for a defendant whose public persona has been crafted in large part by his social media behavior, Trump's lawyers have mined the depths of prospective jurors' social media accounts for potential signs of bias in their years-old comments and memes. Several of them were cut on Tuesday after the judge examined their prior posts.</p><p>Merchan dismissed one man after Trump lawyer Todd Blanche presented a social media post in which the juror wrote, “Good news!! Trump lost his court battle on his unlawful travel ban!!!” along with a suggestion to “lock him up.”</p><p>In other instances, however, Merchan refused Blanche’s effort to kick off certain prospective jurors, including one whose husband shared a post suggesting that the comic book team “The Avengers” unite against Trump.</p><p>Though Trump himself said little during the day’s events, he earned himself his first reprimand from Merchan.</p><p>"Your client was audibly uttering something," Merchan told Blanche after he had finished questioning a prospective juror.</p><p>"I won’t tolerate that,” Merchan said. “I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. I want to make that crystal clear."</p><p>Merchan instructed Blanche to tell Trump to stop his antics. As Merchan spoke, Trump sat slumped in his seat, as though he were sitting in a lounge chair.</p>]]></content:encoded>

After losing the case in district court, Trump appealed the decision to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals and then to the Supreme Court. In July 2020, the Supreme Court ruled against Trump, with Chief Justice John Roberts writing in the majority opinion that “no citizen, not even the President, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding.”</p><p>But though the outcome was a victory for the district attorney’s office, clearing that hurdle didn’t guarantee a direct path to prosecution.</p><p>For one thing, the district attorney’s office was exploring multiple inquiries involving Trump, including whether he may have committed tax, insurance and banking fraud over matters unrelated to the hush money payments.</p><p>And for another, Trump wasn’t done fighting the subpoena. He challenged it again, arguing that it was overly broad. Again, he lost his argument in the lower courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court also rejected his final bid to stop his accounting firm from handing over the financial records.</p><p>Finally, in February 2021, Vance’s prosecutors obtained the documents they’d long been seeking.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">Doubts about a legal theory</h2><p>By this point, Trump was no longer president, having left office one month earlier. And Vance’s office accelerated its investigation, hiring veteran prosecutor Mark Pomerantz to ramp up the Trump probe right around the same time.</p><p>In his first few weeks on the case, Pomerantz decided to focus his efforts on the hush money portion of the district attorney’s sprawling investigation.<br /></p><br /><p>“The return to life of the hush money facts as a potential basis for prosecution sparked a nickname for this part of the investigation: the hush money inquiry came to be known as the ‘zombie’ case, because it was alive, and then it was dead, and now it had sprung back to life,” Pomerantz later wrote in his book, “People v. Donald Trump: An Inside Account.”</p><p>But by March 2021, prosecutors had struggled to settle on a legal theory for charging Trump in the hush money matter. They were concerned that charging him with felonies for falsifying business records might not hold up in court, according to Pomerantz. So it went “back into the grave,” he wrote.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">A sprawling investigation continues</h2><p>On March 12, Vance said he wouldn’t run for reelection and would leave office at the end of the year. He also said internally that before stepping down he would make a decision about whether to charge Trump.</p><p>Over the next few months, the district attorney’s office moved on to other areas of inquiry related to Trump, including looking at whether he had inflated the valuations of his properties — a matter that was eventually brought as a civil case by the New York attorney general’s office — and whether the Trump Organization had doled out untaxed perks to its executives.</p><p>By May, prosecutors began presenting information about the untaxed perks to a grand jury, and by the beginning of July, it had indicted the Trump Organization and its then-CFO Allen Weisselberg.</p><h2 style="text-align: left">New top prosecutor, new approach</h2><p>In November, Vance’s successor, Alvin Bragg, was elected as district attorney.</p><p>Bragg was sworn in in January 2022, and in his initial weeks in office, he hesitated on moving forward with the case related to valuations.

It seemed possible that the court could settle on a view of the law that would preserve the vast majority of the cases the Justice Department filed that used the obstruction statute to level a serious felony charge at a Jan. 6 defendant.</p><p>Tuesday’s arguments were a crucial moment for the government and its three-year-long campaign to charge many of the roughly 2,500 people who breached the Capitol that day, including hundreds who assaulted police in an effort to disrupt Congress’ session to certify Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election. The court’s ruling, expected by late June, may also have ramifications for Donald Trump, who is facing two obstruction charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith as part of a broader indictment related to the then-president’s effort to subvert the 2020 election.</p><p>Trump was not mentioned during Tuesday’s arguments.</p><p>Several of the Republican-appointed justices appeared to question whether the Justice Department has been evenhanded in its prosecution of the Jan. 6 defendants, echoing claims that they are being treated far more harshly than other protesters who have disrupted congressional proceedings or even arguments at the Supreme Court.</p><p>“Would a heckler in today's audience qualify, or at the State of the Union address? Would pulling a fire alarm before a vote qualify, and for 20 years in prison?” Justice Neil Gorsuch asked, citing the maximum sentence available under the obstruction provision. He appeared to refer to an episode last year when Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/333749" data-person-id="333749" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1713292796632,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-86a8-d221-a5c5-a6aaa8970005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1713292796632,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-86a8-d221-a5c5-a6aaa8970005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;333749\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://directory.politicopro.com/member/333749\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Rep.

He later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge.</p><p>“Let's say that today five people get up one after the other and they shout either, ‘Keep the January 6 insurrectionists in jail!’ or ‘Free the January 6 patriots!’ And as a result of this, our police officers have to remove them forcibly from the courtroom. And let's say we have to delay the proceeding for five minutes,” Justice Samuel Alito hypothesized.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351053834112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Speaking for the Justice Department, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said those sorts of minimal, brief interruptions wouldn’t qualify as “obstruction” under the statute, although Alito quickly countered that the law also prohibits conduct that “impedes” a proceeding.</p><p>Prelogar said there were no examples in history that mirror the attack on the Capitol, which she described a direct assault on a constitutional process. She also noted that of the more than 1,350 people charged in connection with the riot, only about a quarter faced the obstruction charge, in part because of what she described as the difficult hurdles of proving that rioters were both aware of the congressional proceedings and explicitly intended to disrupt them. She called that evidence of intent a “dividing line” between those Jan. 6 defendants charged with obstruction and those facing misdemeanor penalties.</p><p>For many of the justices, it was the first time they have spoken publicly in detail about the events of Jan. 6.</p><p>Justice Clarence Thomas described it as a “violent protest” and contended that there have been “many” such demonstrations “that have interfered with proceedings.” He wondered whether the Justice Department had ever deployed the obstruction statute to deal with them.</p><p>“What happened on January 6th was very, very serious, and I'm not equating this with that,” Alito said before saying it was important to consider some hypotheticals to determine the “outer reaches” of the government’s interpretation of the law. He went on to reference a Gaza-focused protest Monday blocking traffic on San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge and to ask if something similar done on Washington-area bridges and aimed at preventing a Congressional hearing could be prosecuted as obstruction of Congress.</p><p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that the Justice Department’s novel use of the obstruction law to cover a violent protest was justified by the unique nature of the events of that day.</p><p>“We've never had a situation before where there's been a situation like this with people attempting to stop a proceeding violently. So, I'm not sure what the lack of history proves,” she said.</p><p>“I’m not sure that that’s true,” said attorney Jeffrey Green, who argued for Jan. 6 defendant Joseph Fischer, who is contesting his indictment. Green pointed to incidents in Portland, Oregon, in 2020, when protesters set fires and besieged the federal courthouse for weeks.</p><p>Green also said a broad interpretation of the obstruction statute would cause people to reconsider all sorts of demonstrations.</p><p>“It’s going to chill protected activities. People are going to worry about the kinds of protests they engage in, even if they're peaceful, because the government has this weapon,” Green said.</p><p>The arguments Tuesday turned on a fairly arcane interpretation of a criminal obstruction of justice provision Congress passed in 2002 to correct perceived loopholes dealing with acts that could interfere with active or expected federal investigations. Jan. 6 defendants say it was only meant to cover classic types of evidence tampering, such as document shredding. But prosecutors say Congress’ goal after the Enron scandal was to pass a “catch-all” obstruction statute that would include many different ways of impeding legal or congressional proceedings — including kinds they couldn’t even envision at the time. That “omnibus“ goal, they said, is reflected in the broad wording of the obstruction law itself.</p><p>Most judges handling Jan. 6 cases have agreed, reading the provision broadly as covering any type of effort to obstruct or impede an official proceeding. But one, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, said the obstruction has to directly affect evidence, such as through document shredding, forgery or other document-focused actions. In the context of Jan. 6, that could limit such charges to instances when prosecutors can prove the defendant knew electoral votes were to be delivered or tallied and intended to disrupt that process.</p><p>Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to agree with the defendants’ position that the provision fits into a framework of obstruction laws Congress has passed and was intended to close a specific loophole, rather than apply to a wide range of obstructive conduct.</p><p>Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Amy Coney Barrett seemed to offer a middle ground position, suggesting that a narrow reading of the obstruction law might still encompass the actions of many rioters on Jan. 6 — since those rioters sought to block Congress’ access to the electoral vote certificates. That reading might also preserve related charges against Trump, who prosecutors say sought to introduce fraudulent electoral vote certificates to Congress as part of his scheme to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p>Green seemed to go even further in his argument, contending that merely trying to delay the arrival or count of the electoral votes wouldn’t be enough for a conviction.</p><p>“Attempting to stop a vote count or something like that is a very different act than actually changing a document or altering a document,” he said.</p><p>Prelogar told the justices prosecutors could prove in many cases that defendants knew that electoral votes were to be tallied at the Capitol that day, but proving that any individual protester’s actions were aimed at the actual certificates would be challenging. “That would be a difficult standard for us to satisfy,” she said.</p><p>Both Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan sounded unpersuaded by arguments that Congress wasn’t intending to sweep in such a wide range of conduct that might interfere with a proceeding.</p><p>“They wanted to cover every base, and they didn’t do it in a logical way, but they managed to do it,” Sotomayor declared.</p><p>As Alito chastised the Justice Department for going too easy on some recent outbursts at the Supreme Court, he overstated his case by saying, “I don't think any one of those protesters has been sentenced to even one day in prison.”</p><p>In fact, in 2017, a judge gave brief jail sentences to five people who disrupted a 2015 high court argument by shouting in protest of the Citizens United campaign finance decision. Four were sentenced to a weekend in jail, while one got two weekends behind bars, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/five-face-sentencing-monday-for-supreme-court-disruption/2017/07/23/54f9a392-6e38-11e7-9c15-177740635e83_story.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the Washington Post reported&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/five-face-sentencing-monday-for-supreme-court-disruption/2017/07/23/54f9a392-6e38-11e7-9c15-177740635e83_story.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f1a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f1a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the Washington Post reported</a>.</p><p>The outcome of the case argued Tuesday could affect Trump, who has been charged with two counts of obstruction by special counsel Jack Smith, over Trump’s own involvement in efforts to prevent Congress from certifying the election.</p><p>A Justice Department attorney set to argue at the high court next week against Trump’s claim of immunity from prosecution in that case, Michael Dreeben, was present in the courtroom and intently took notes as justices grilled Prelogar about the government’s broad view of the obstruction provision.</p><p>Smith insisted in a court filing last week that even a complete loss for the government in the case heard Tuesday would not undermine the obstruction charges Trump faces because prosecutors can prove he intended to interfere with the tallying of electoral votes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The store was the site of a 2022 fatal stabbing, which the perpetrator described as self defense against an unprovoked attack in a case that inflamed conservatives.</p><p>The appearance signaled an effort by Trump to go on the offensive after two days besieged in court, while kneecapping Alvin Bragg, the Democratic prosecutor trying his case. Unfolding on the sidelines of the trial, the brief remarks served as the opening of the weeks-long, courtroom-constricted phase of Trump’s campaign — a relentless critique of Democrats’ handling of crime to counter public focus on his own criminal cases.</p><p>“It’s Alvin Bragg’s fault. Alvin Bragg does nothing; he goes after guys like Trump who did nothing wrong,” Trump told reporters gathered outside the store. “There are hundreds of murderers all over the city. They know who they are, and they don’t pick them up. They go after Trump.”</p><p>He used the opportunity to similarly go after the influx of migrants into New York City, seeking to pit them against Black and Latino residents and going so far as to predict he would win New York — an unlikely outcome, as no Republican presidential candidate has carried the state in 30 years.<br /></p><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/2d/f9/4f68025445aa95a736f5343da816/img-0103.jpg" /><br /><br /><img src="https://static.politico.com/17/63/3ad8db144e3ea6025a47e9f7371d/img-0107.jpg" /><br /><p>Anticipating the attack on his record, <a href="https://twitter.com/manhattanda/status/1780329213095981199?s=46" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Bragg’s office tweeted NYPD statistics&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/manhattanda/status/1780329213095981199?s=46&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f1f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f1f0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Bragg’s office tweeted NYPD statistics</a> showing a 39 percent drop in shootings and a 23 percent drop in murders over the past year in Manhattan. </p><p>Trump, flanked by Bodega and Small Business Group member Carlos Collado and the bodega’s owner, Maad Ahmed, called his trial “rigged” and said of the judge overseeing his case, “There’s never been a judge so conflicted as this.”</p><p>The presumptive GOP presidential nominee spent much of Tuesday in court, before the trip to the bodega where clerk Jose Alba fatally stabbed a customer who was attacking him in a case that captured the attention of Republicans nationally. Alba was initially charged with murder, but Bragg later dropped the charges.</p><p>“This matter was resolved nearly two years ago, and the charges were dismissed after a thorough investigation,” Bragg spokesperson Doug Cohen said. “DA Bragg’s top priority remains combating violent crime and the office has worked hand in hand with the NYPD to drive down overall crime in Manhattan, including double digit decreases in homicides and shootings since he took office.”</p><p>Trump’s visit put him on Bragg’s turf — the neighborhood that raised the top prosecutor, after two days in a courtroom where he is being tried on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351055597112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Trump’s campaign permitted several dozen supporters to pack into a space near the bodega, where they cheered him loudly, chanted, “Four more years!” and sang, “The Star-Spangled Banner.” He greeted them warmly before heading into the store for a few minutes. </p><p>Beyond the police barricades, hundreds of New Yorkers crowded to watch the spectacle. And while some appeared to support Trump, others booed him. Just after his motorcade took off, a group arrived with a sense of humor and a banner advertising, “Trump dildos on sale now.”</p><p>The incident highlighted the complications of running for president while on trial.</p><p>The drama unfolding in the Manhattan courtroom and the trial’s demands on the former president’s schedule are not welcome by the candidate or his campaign<b>, </b>which has sought repeatedly to delay the trial. But Trump has decided to make the most of it, using it to underscore his claims that the justice system is unfairly rigged against him and that he is the victim of political persecution.<br /></p><br /><p>Trump's campaign has also worked closely with his allies to make sure they are blanketing the airwaves with talking points that tie the trial to President Joe Biden. Surrogates have been asked to call this the "Biden trials," a phrase the former president has used himself as he railed against the proceedings on Truth Social.</p><p>On the social media site on Tuesday, Trump wrote, “MY TRIAL IS AN ASSAULT ON AMERICA!”</p><p>Democrats, readily on the defensive over crime and border security, have sought to play up their electoral advantage on abortion — tying Republicans and Trump, specifically, to what have proven to be unpopular restrictions since the overturning of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>.</p><p>Trump’s appearance Tuesday also served as a preview of the way he is likely to campaign for the duration of the proceedings. On Trump's days off from the trial — Wednesday, when the judge attends to other business, and the weekends — he plans to attend fundraisers and continue campaigning.

Trump advisers concede they will have less money than Biden, who has established a formidable fundraising apparatus. But they insist they will have enough to compete.</p><p>Over the first three months of the year, Trump’s Save America Joint Fundraising Committee, which has been the primary fundraising vehicle for his presidential bid, reported transferring $33.8 million to his campaign, including $14.7 million in March that had not been previously reported. Trump’s campaign will file its own report later this week for March, but the joint committee usually accounts for nearly all of its cash flow.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351030867112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>The joint fundraising committee also burned through $21 million on fundraising expenses over three months, which reduced what it had left to send to Trump’s campaign. Expenses included $7.2 million in fundraising fees paid to the Virginia-based firm Active Engagement, as well as $3.2 million spent on direct mail and $2 million on merchant fees.</p><p>The joint committee also raises money for Trump’s Save America leadership PAC, although it did not report any transfers to that group in the first quarter.</p><p>But the former president’s initial team-up with the Republican National Committee raked in big bucks, with a new joint fundraising committee, Trump 47 Committee, raising $23 million.</p><p>The committee’s fundraising was driven by large donors, many of whom are familiar Republican donors but had not given to the RNC yet this cycle. Eighteen donors gave at least $800,000 to the joint committee, accounting for 62 percent of its fundraising. Among those who maxed out were Robert Bigelow, the Nevada real estate magnate who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/08/desantis-trump-2024-00126054" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;formerly backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/08/desantis-trump-2024-00126054&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f240000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000018e-f017-ddbd-adef-f39f4f240001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">formerly backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis</a>, former Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) and former Trump administration official Linda McMahon. The list also includes hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, who was a prominent supporter of Trump’s 2016 campaign. The former president has been working of late to cultivate the backing of Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah.</p><p>Only $6,600 that any donor gives to the joint fundraising committee can go to Trump’s campaign. So the big checks also meant big funds headed to the RNC, which can accept far more from large donors. Trump 47 Committee reported transferring $10.3 million to the RNC in the last few days of March, a major boost from the group that had raised just $10.6 million from all sources the month prior.<br /></p><br /><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6351034368112" frameBorder="0"></iframe> <br /><p>Under its joint fundraising formula, Trump 47 Committee is also set to send money to Trump’s leadership PAC, Save America, and a range of state Republican parties, though it reported no such transfers in March.</p><p>The new reports include all activity through March 31. But many Trump-aligned groups, including the former president’s official campaign, are on a different filing schedule and aren’t required to disclose their activity for the month of March until Saturday.</p><p>Trump has been intensifying his courtship of major donors and has been regularly dialing up givers who have remained on the sidelines. Earlier this month, he held a fundraiser at the home of billionaire investor John Paulson that his campaign said raised more than $50 million. Last week, he traveled to Atlanta to hold another fundraising event.</p><p>Trump’s campaign last month executed a hostile takeover of the RNC, which had trailed its Democratic counterpart in fundraising. As part of the restructuring, the Trump team is moving the RNC fundraising apparatus from Washington to West Palm Beach, Florida, where the campaign is based.</p>]]></content:encoded>
