At a hearing today, he bridled at Democratic Senator Al Franken&#8217;s accusation that he&#8217;d &#8212; quote &#8212; &#8220;moved the goalposts&#8221; on the nature of his discussions.</p>
<p><strong>SEN. AL FRANKEN, </strong>D-Minn.: First it was, I didn&#8217;t have communications with Russians, which wasn&#8217;t true. Then it was, I never met with any Russians to discuss any political campaign, which may or may not be true.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s, I didn&#8217;t discuss interference in the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>JEFF SESSIONS, </strong>Attorney General: Well, let me just say without hesitation, that I conducted no improper discussions with the Russians at any time regarding the campaign or any other item facing this country.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Sessions has recused himself from the Justice Department&#8217;s investigation into Russia&#8217;s election meddling.</p>
<p>President Trump had new criticism today for former FBI Director James Comey over the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe. He complained again that Comey decided to clear Clinton before she was even interviewed. That&#8217;s based on newly released draft statements by Comey from May of 2016. FBI officials say it was already clear that no charges were warranted.</p>
<p>On another issue, the president faced fallout over the death of Army Sergeant La David Johnson in Niger this month. Congresswoman Frederica Wilson says she was with Mrs. Johnson when the president called. The Florida Democrat told The Washington Post that Mr. Trump said &#8212; quote &#8212; &#8220;He knew what he was signing up for, but I guess it hurts anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sergeant&#8217;s mother confirmed it, but the president denied it, and White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders went after Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>SARAH SANDERS,</strong> White House Press Secretary: This is a president who loves our country very much, who has the greatest level of respect for men and women in uniform and wanted to call and offer condolences to the family, and I think to try to create something from that, that the congresswoman is doing, is, frankly, appalling and disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> The Post also reported on another incident today. It quoted the father of a soldier killed in Afghanistan as saying the president offered $25,000 from his personal account, but never followed through.</p>
<p>We will get more detail on all of this after the news summary.</p>
<p>The death toll in Northern California&#8217;s wildfires rose to 42 today. Officials in Sonoma County found the remains of the latest victim, as they searched hundreds of burned homes. Meanwhile, fire crews made new gains overnight with the help of cooler weather and low winds.</p>
<p>A two-time Olympic medalist says the former team doctor for U.S. women&#8217;s gymnastics sexually abused her for years. McKayla Maroney is the highest profile athlete to come forward in the scandal. In a statement today, she said Dr. Larry Nassar began molesting her when she was just 13. He&#8217;s awaiting sentencing on a child pornography charge, but has denied any sexual abuse.</p>
<p>More questions tonight about drug pricing. A new study finds the costs of injectable cancer drugs, approved since 1996, rose an average of 25 percent over eight years. That&#8217;s far higher than the rate of inflation. The study was based at Emory University and published in &#8220;The Journal of Clinical Oncology.&#8221;</p>
<p>And on Wall Street, health insurers and IBM fueled a surge in stocks today. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 160 points, more than half-a-percent, to close above 23000 for the first time. The Nasdaq rose just a fraction, and the S&amp;P 500 was up two points.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Weinstein resigned from the board of his production company following numerous revelations of sexual harassment and several allegations of assault.</p>
<p>More than three dozen women have said Weinstein harassed them. While Weinstein has admitted to behaving inappropriately, he has said he didn&#8217;t physically assault anyone.</p>
<p>One of those women is Katherine Kendall. She was a 23-year-old actress who met Weinstein in 1993. She alleges that he invited her to his apartment in New York, where, she says, he took off his clothes and asked for a massage.</p>
<p>As other actresses began coming forward about their painful experiences, she also went public with her own story.</p>
<p>She joins me now from Los Angeles.</p>
<p>First, thanks for joining us.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t want to relive something that&#8217;s painful for you, but you are taking a public stance on it.</p>
<p>For people who don&#8217;t know your story, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL,</strong> Actress/ Photographer: Well, I was you know, a young actress, and I had had a formal meeting at the Miramax office earlier that day.</p>
<p>And then, at the end of the meeting, which I thought went really well, he invited me to come to screenings. He said: &#8220;Welcome to the Miramax family. You know, come to premieres, screenings, et cetera. In fact, there&#8217;s one this afternoon. Would you like to come?&#8221;</p>
<p>And I said, &#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I ended up going to see a movie with him. It ended up just being a movie, not a screening, but the film &#8220;Red Rock West.&#8221; And, you know, that&#8217;s right when I had this sort of sinking feeling that something wasn&#8217;t going right.</p>
<p>And then, after the movie, we walked for a few blocks. And he said he needed to go up to his apartment to get something, and would I just come with him real quick? And I sort of said no, and we went back and forth on that for a minute. It was sort of a negotiation with him always, trying to sort of stand my ground, but then be convinced it was OK.</p>
<p>I did go into his apartment. Once there, we talked for a long time about art and movies. And I felt like he was treating me like an intellect.</p>
<p>And I felt like the meeting was going really well, and sort of continued. I didn&#8217;t feel unsafe once I was in there. And, at one point, then, he got up to go to the bathroom. And he came back in a robe and asked me to give him a massage.</p>
<p>And I was extremely uncomfortable. And I was like, oh, God, no, I&#8217;m not comfortable with that. And we went back and forth on that.</p>
<p>And then he went back to the bathroom again, and came back this time completely naked. And, you know, that changed it entirely for me, too. It just took it to the next place. It was completely disorienting. And I was scared, you know? I was really scared.</p>
<p>And then it became sort of a cat-and-mouse game of, like, how am I going to get out of there?</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m &#8212; it&#8217;s hard to make sense of what someone is trying to do to you when they&#8217;re fully naked, and they&#8217;re&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> You know, I&#8217;m 105 pounds. He&#8217;s a large man standing between me and the door.</p>
<p>And, I mean, I felt very resolute, like, I will definitely get out of here somehow. But I&#8217;m not &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s going to happen here. You know, a lot was going through my head.</p>
<p>And he said, well, if you won&#8217;t give me a massage, will you at least show me your breasts? And it was just &#8212; you know, it was, all in all, an extremely humiliating experience for me.</p>
<p>And even though I got away, I felt like something had still &#8212; like something horrible had just happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> You know, in the immediate aftermath, did you tell someone about it? Because you have said before that you felt ashamed&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I did.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> &#8230; even though you were the victim.</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I did.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really interesting how that happens. And I think &#8212; you know, I&#8217;m older now, and I have done some work on myself. And I have learned that a lot of people feel that way.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s not &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t just me. But the just me feeling that this is my fault, this must have only happened to me, there&#8217;s something wrong with me, is so common when someone perpetrates against you.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> What were the&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> And I did. I told my mom.</p>
<p>And I told some good friends. But, you know, one of the things that happened was, I didn&#8217;t want them to tell anybody. You know, people wanted to help me, but they didn&#8217;t know how, and I didn&#8217;t want them to try too hard, because I didn&#8217;t want it to backlash.</p>
<p>I was scared. And I think that it&#8217;s important to remember that we don&#8217;t really come from a culture that supports women in talking about sexual harassment, in my &#8212; in my experience, that is. And, you know, I just haven&#8217;t felt like it was something I was going to get support on&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> You know, how long&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> &#8230; in the bigger picture.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p>How long did this feeling last? Or, I guess, what are the longer-term ripple effects here? Did it shake your confidence in your abilities?</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I think it did. I think it did. I think it did.</p>
<p>I think it made me feel like, wow, you know, that was a wash. He wasn&#8217;t interested at all in what I had to say, or, you know, he didn&#8217;t see any talent there or intellect there. He was assessing the situation the whole time for something else.</p>
<p>And I think that &#8212; that did hurt. You know, I wish it didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> But he had produced so many movies that I thought were wonderful. And it was &#8212; it&#8217;s hard when someone has made art that you love, and how do you stay attached to liking their art, but feeling conflicted about them?</p>
<p>And, yes, I think it does have long-term effects. I think you tuck it away. And then, for me, also, I realized that it came back when I would see his name or see him in person. I would start to sort of tremble all over again.</p>
<p>I mean, I wouldn&#8217;t think about him on a daily basis or anything for years, and then I would see him, and I would think, oh, I don&#8217;t feel well. I got to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> You know, it would bring up so much emotion.</p>
<p>And the most recent one was the woman in New York, the Italian model. I felt so, so enraged when I saw what happened there, and that they sort of &#8212; the police had him, and that then he got away. And then she was being dragged through the press as somebody who just, you know, wanted a payout, et cetera.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> You know, in the wake of that, there was &#8212; a friend of yours had tweeted, &#8220;At some point, all the women who have been afraid to speak out about Harvey Weinstein are going to have to hold hands and jump.&#8221; This was back in 2015.</p>
<p>And from your Twitter account, you said, &#8220;Agreed.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed like you almost had the opportunity to come forward.</p>
<p>What made you want to come forward now? Has this become a turning point in the industry?</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> This is a turning point. It&#8217;s a turning point.</p>
<p>There are so many times when I thought about it, and then felt like &#8212; there were times when I thought about it and said, well, I have nothing to lose, I will just do it. And then I thought, I &#8212; I just didn&#8217;t have the strength or the courage yet.</p>
<p>And I think somebody like Jodi Kantor doing the story for The New York Times, the fact that she thought it was a story at all was startling to me and made me feel like, wow, something is going to be done.</p>
<p>And I knew she had told me &#8212; I mean, they were looking for women that this had happened to, because they&#8217;d been hearing rumors for so long that it happened to so many people. And she had told me other people were coming out.</p>
<p>And I thought, I can&#8217;t &#8212; when I watched Rose McGowan or any of the other actresses come forward, I just &#8212; or Ashley Judd &#8212; I just thought, they look strong to me, and I don&#8217;t want to be the one that stays silent.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Well, Katherine Kendall&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I want to stand beside them.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Katherine Kendall, thank you very much for speaking with us.</p>
<p>And, hopefully, there are other people that are empowered by you coming forward.</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I hope so. Thank you.</p>

<p>And then he went back to the bathroom again, and came back this time completely naked. And, you know, that changed it entirely for me, too. It just took it to the next place. It was completely disorienting. And I was scared, you know? I was really scared.</p>
<p>And then it became sort of a cat-and-mouse game of, like, how am I going to get out of there?</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m &#8212; it&#8217;s hard to make sense of what someone is trying to do to you when they&#8217;re fully naked, and they&#8217;re&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> You know, I&#8217;m 105 pounds. He&#8217;s a large man standing between me and the door.</p>
<p>And, I mean, I felt very resolute, like, I will definitely get out of here somehow. But I&#8217;m not &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s going to happen here. You know, a lot was going through my head.</p>
<p>And he said, well, if you won&#8217;t give me a massage, will you at least show me your breasts? And it was just &#8212; you know, it was, all in all, an extremely humiliating experience for me.</p>
<p>And even though I got away, I felt like something had still &#8212; like something horrible had just happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> You know, in the immediate aftermath, did you tell someone about it? Because you have said before that you felt ashamed&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I did.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> &#8230; even though you were the victim.</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I did.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really interesting how that happens. And I think &#8212; you know, I&#8217;m older now, and I have done some work on myself. And I have learned that a lot of people feel that way.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s not &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t just me. But the just me feeling that this is my fault, this must have only happened to me, there&#8217;s something wrong with me, is so common when someone perpetrates against you.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> What were the&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> And I did. I told my mom.</p>
<p>And I told some good friends. But, you know, one of the things that happened was, I didn&#8217;t want them to tell anybody. You know, people wanted to help me, but they didn&#8217;t know how, and I didn&#8217;t want them to try too hard, because I didn&#8217;t want it to backlash.</p>
<p>I was scared. And I think that it&#8217;s important to remember that we don&#8217;t really come from a culture that supports women in talking about sexual harassment, in my &#8212; in my experience, that is. And, you know, I just haven&#8217;t felt like it was something I was going to get support on&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> You know, how long&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> &#8230; in the bigger picture.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p>How long did this feeling last? Or, I guess, what are the longer-term ripple effects here? Did it shake your confidence in your abilities?</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I think it did. I think it did. I think it did.</p>
<p>I think it made me feel like, wow, you know, that was a wash. He wasn&#8217;t interested at all in what I had to say, or, you know, he didn&#8217;t see any talent there or intellect there. He was assessing the situation the whole time for something else.</p>
<p>And I think that &#8212; that did hurt. You know, I wish it didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> But he had produced so many movies that I thought were wonderful. And it was &#8212; it&#8217;s hard when someone has made art that you love, and how do you stay attached to liking their art, but feeling conflicted about them?</p>
<p>And, yes, I think it does have long-term effects. I think you tuck it away. And then, for me, also, I realized that it came back when I would see his name or see him in person. I would start to sort of tremble all over again.</p>
<p>I mean, I wouldn&#8217;t think about him on a daily basis or anything for years, and then I would see him, and I would think, oh, I don&#8217;t feel well. I got to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> You know, it would bring up so much emotion.</p>
<p>And the most recent one was the woman in New York, the Italian model. I felt so, so enraged when I saw what happened there, and that they sort of &#8212; the police had him, and that then he got away. And then she was being dragged through the press as somebody who just, you know, wanted a payout, et cetera.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> You know, in the wake of that, there was &#8212; a friend of yours had tweeted, &#8220;At some point, all the women who have been afraid to speak out about Harvey Weinstein are going to have to hold hands and jump.&#8221; This was back in 2015.</p>
<p>And from your Twitter account, you said, &#8220;Agreed.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed like you almost had the opportunity to come forward.</p>
<p>What made you want to come forward now? Has this become a turning point in the industry?</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> This is a turning point. It&#8217;s a turning point.</p>
<p>There are so many times when I thought about it, and then felt like &#8212; there were times when I thought about it and said, well, I have nothing to lose, I will just do it. And then I thought, I &#8212; I just didn&#8217;t have the strength or the courage yet.</p>
<p>And I think somebody like Jodi Kantor doing the story for The New York Times, the fact that she thought it was a story at all was startling to me and made me feel like, wow, something is going to be done.</p>
<p>And I knew she had told me &#8212; I mean, they were looking for women that this had happened to, because they&#8217;d been hearing rumors for so long that it happened to so many people. And she had told me other people were coming out.</p>
<p>And I thought, I can&#8217;t &#8212; when I watched Rose McGowan or any of the other actresses come forward, I just &#8212; or Ashley Judd &#8212; I just thought, they look strong to me, and I don&#8217;t want to be the one that stays silent.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Well, Katherine Kendall&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I want to stand beside them.</p>
<p><strong>HARI SREENIVASAN:</strong> Katherine Kendall, thank you very much for speaking with us.</p>
<p>And, hopefully, there are other people that are empowered by you coming forward.</p>
<p><strong>KATHERINE KENDALL:</strong> I hope so. Thank you.</p>

<em>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell held a news conference today after the second day of the annual owners meeting. Watch his remarks in the player above.</em></p>
<p>NFL players will be encouraged to stand for the national anthem at the start of the football games, the league&#8217;s chief told reporters today.</p>
<p>After two days of meeting with owners of each NFL team, representatives for the players&#8217; union and players themselves, the NFL has reiterated its decision to keep its existing policy of not requiring players to stand during the anthem. Goodell said yesterday that the league would<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/sports/football/nfl-anthem-protests-trump.html">not instate a rule</a> that would penalize players who refuse to stand for the anthem.</p>

<p>&#8220;We believe everyone should stand for the national anthem,&#8221; he told reporters at a news conference today. &#8220;That&#8217;s an important part of our policy. It&#8217;s also an important part of our game that we all take great pride in. And it&#8217;s also important for us to honor our flag and our country and I think our fans expect us to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goodell&#8217;s remarks came after President Donald Trump continued his criticism of the NFL this morning. On Twitter, Trump said: &#8220;The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem. Total disrespect for our great country!&#8221;</p>
<p>After former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeled during the anthem last year to protest police killings of unarmed black men, dozens of other players joined him to draw greater attention to social and racial injustice. Last month, Trump said the NFL ought to fire players who didn&#8217;t stand for the anthem.</p>
<p>The players &#8220;are not doing this in any way to be disrespectful to the flag,&#8221; Goodell said today. &#8220;But they also understand how it&#8217;s being interpreted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goodell also said the league wanted to stay out of the political arena over the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not looking to get into politics,&#8221; he told reporters. &#8220;What we&#8217;re looking to do is to continue to get people focused on football.&#8221;</p>

<p>In America, there’s a significant kind of public insistence that one’s “freedom” is fundamentally tied to one’s wealth.</p>
<p>Much of the country views America through an aspirational and transformative lens, a colorblind and bias-free utopia, wherein wealth conveys equality and acts as a panacea for social and racial ills. Once an individual achieves massive financial success, or so the message goes, he or she will “transcend” the scourge of economic and racial inequality, truly becoming “free.”</p>
<p>Working in parallel with this reverence for this colorblind version of the “American Dream” is the belief that economic privilege mandates patriotic gratitude. Across industries and disciplines, Americans are told to love their nation uncritically, be thankful that they are exceptional enough to live in a country that allows citizens the opportunity to reach astronomical heights of economic prosperity.</p>
<p>For the nation’s black citizens, there’s often an additional racialized presumption lurking under the surface of these concepts: the notion that black success and wealth demands public silence on systemic issues of inequality and oppression.</p>
<div class='nhpullquote right'>One&#8217;s economic privilege is a lousy barrier against discrimination and oppression.</div>
<p>These are durable and fragile ideologies that prop up the concept of the American Dream – durable because they are encoded in the very fabric of American culture (most Americans, including African Americans, have readily embraced these ideologies as assumed facts); yet fragile because it’s all too easy to see that one&#8217;s economic privilege is a lousy barrier against both individual and systemic discrimination and oppression.</p>
<p>Consequently, black people have also been among the most vocal challengers of these ideologies, as we’ve seen most recently with the Colin Kaepernick and the NFL #TakeAKnee demonstrations. In a show of solidary with the free agent quarterback, professional football players – the vast majority of whom are black – have been kneeling during the National Anthem as a means of protesting racial injustice and police brutality.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/nfl-players-team-defiance-solidarity/">WATCH: NFL players team up in defiance and solidarity</a></strong></p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, the president of the United States has brought renewed attention to the inherent tensions that define the ideologies of the “American Dream” through his repeated public criticisms of these kneeling NFL players.</p>
<p>“If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues,” Trump recently tweeted, he or she should not be allowed to kneel. Labeling the protestors actions “disrespectful” to the country, flag and anthem, President Donald Trump has called for players to be fired, encouraged a boycott of the NFL, insisted that the league pass a rule mandating that players stand for the anthem and derided the protestors as “sons of bitches.”</p>
<p>In a dramatic ploy more befitting of a scripted reality television show, the president gloated that he had instructed Vice President Mike Pence to walk out of an Indianapolis Colts game the moment any player kneeled. This was an orchestrated show of power and outrage, designed to send a flamboyant political message given that Trump and Pence knew in advance that on that particular day, the Colts were playing the San Francisco 49ers – the team that currently has the most protestors. The NFL’s announcement this week that the league has no plans to penalize protesting players is the most recent event to provoke the president’s fury; taking to social media during the early morning, he once again equated kneeling with “total disrespect” for our country.</p>
<p>As many have pointed out, the president’s moralizing outrage toward the NFL players is selective and deeply flawed – his apparent patriotic loyalty hasn’t stopped the billionaire politician from criticizing the removal of Confederate statues, or attacking a Gold Star family, or mocking Sen. John McCain’s military service.</p>
<div class='nhpullquote right'>By aggressively targeting the NFL players, Trump believes that he is “winning the cultural war,” having made black “millionaire sport athletes his new [Hillary Clinton].”</div>
<p>The NFL players and their defenders have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/10/09/this-is-about-systemic-oppression-eric-reid-becomes-the-voice-of-49ers-protest-with-criticism-of-pence/?utm_term=.2604f4d5523d">repeatedly stated</a> that the protests are intended to highlight racial inequality and oppression. They’ve also explained that their decision to kneel emerged from a desire to protest peacefully and respectfully after a sustained conversation with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/opinion/colin-kaepernick-football-protests.html">military veterans</a>.</p>
<p>Trump has chosen to ignore these rationales and the structural issues of inequality that motivate the protests and instead, advance a narrative exclusively concerned with overt displays of American patriotism and the “privilege” of the NFL players. As one of president’s advisors explained, by aggressively targeting the NFL players, Trump believes that he is “winning the cultural war,” having made black “millionaire sport athletes his new [Hillary Clinton].”</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/column-americas-sport-nfl-cannot-escape-politics/">READ MORE: As ‘America’s sport,’ the NFL cannot escape politics</a></strong></p>
<p>It’s a cynical statement, revealing the president&#8217;s perception of the jingoism of his base of supporters who envision him as a crusader for American values and symbols.</p>
<p>In casting the black protestors as the antithesis of all of this, Trump has marked the players as unpatriotic elites and enemies of the nation. For a president who has consistently fumbled his way through domestic and foreign policy since he was elected, a culture war between “hard-working” and “virtuous” working-class and middle-class white Americans and rich, ungrateful black football players is a welcome public distraction.</p>
<p>Trump’s attacks on the NFL protestors are rooted in those competing tensions inherent to the American Dream: that wealth equals freedom; that economic privilege demands patriotic gratitude; and most importantly, that black people’s individual economic prosperity invalidates their concerns about systemic injustice and requires their silence on racial oppression.</p>
<p>Among the protestors’ detractors, this has become a common line of attack, a means of disparaging the black NFL players’ activism by pointing to their apparent wealth. The fact that systemic racism is demonstrably real and that individual prosperity does not make one immune to racial discrimination appears to be lost on the protestors’ critics.</p>
<p>Theirs is a grievance that suggests that black athletes should be grateful to live in this country; that racism can’t exist in America since black professional athletes are allowed to play and sign contracts for considerable sums of money; that black players owe the nation their silence since America “gave” them opportunity and access; that black athletes have no moral authority on issues of race and inequality because of their individual success; and that black athletes’ success was never theirs to earn, but instead, was given to them and can just as easily be taken away.</p>
<div class='nhpullquote right'>Black athletes have long been hyper-aware of their peculiar place in American society: beloved for their talents, yet reviled the moment they use their public platform to protest.</div>
<p>This culture war being waged over black athletes is not new. Black athletes – and entertainers – have long been hyper-aware of their peculiar place in American society as individuals beloved for their athletic and artistic talents, yet reviled the moment they use their public platform to protest systemic racial inequality. The parallels between the #TakeAKnee protests and the protests of <a href="https://s-usih.org/2017/09/muhammad-ali-yes-trump-no/">Muhammad Ali</a> or John Carlos and <a href="https://theundefeated.com/features/john-carlos-john-wooten-know-kaepernicks-road-is-a-long-one/">Tommie Smith</a> are readily apparent; so too are there important similarities to the case of <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-paul-robeson-said-77742433/">Paul Robeson</a>.</p>
<p>An outspoken civil rights activist, collegiate and professional football player, lawyer, opera singer and actor, Robeson had his passport revoked in 1950 because of his political activism and speech – actions that all but destroyed his career. The star athlete and entertainer, “who had exemplified American upward mobility” quickly “became public enemy number one” as institutions cancelled his concerts, the public called for his death and anti-Robeson mobs burned effigies of him.</p>
<p>During a 1956 congressional hearing, the chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities beat a familiar refrain with Robeson, challenging the entertainer’s accusations of American racism and racial oppression.

<p>In America, there’s a significant kind of public insistence that one’s “freedom” is fundamentally tied to one’s wealth.</p>
<p>Much of the country views America through an aspirational and transformative lens, a colorblind and bias-free utopia, wherein wealth conveys equality and acts as a panacea for social and racial ills. Once an individual achieves massive financial success, or so the message goes, he or she will “transcend” the scourge of economic and racial inequality, truly becoming “free.”</p>
<p>Working in parallel with this reverence for this colorblind version of the “American Dream” is the belief that economic privilege mandates patriotic gratitude. Across industries and disciplines, Americans are told to love their nation uncritically, be thankful that they are exceptional enough to live in a country that allows citizens the opportunity to reach astronomical heights of economic prosperity.</p>
<p>For the nation’s black citizens, there’s often an additional racialized presumption lurking under the surface of these concepts: the notion that black success and wealth demands public silence on systemic issues of inequality and oppression.</p>
<div class='nhpullquote right'>One&#8217;s economic privilege is a lousy barrier against discrimination and oppression.</div>
<p>These are durable and fragile ideologies that prop up the concept of the American Dream – durable because they are encoded in the very fabric of American culture (most Americans, including African Americans, have readily embraced these ideologies as assumed facts); yet fragile because it’s all too easy to see that one&#8217;s economic privilege is a lousy barrier against both individual and systemic discrimination and oppression.</p>
<p>Consequently, black people have also been among the most vocal challengers of these ideologies, as we’ve seen most recently with the Colin Kaepernick and the NFL #TakeAKnee demonstrations. In a show of solidary with the free agent quarterback, professional football players – the vast majority of whom are black – have been kneeling during the National Anthem as a means of protesting racial injustice and police brutality.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/nfl-players-team-defiance-solidarity/">WATCH: NFL players team up in defiance and solidarity</a></strong></p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, the president of the United States has brought renewed attention to the inherent tensions that define the ideologies of the “American Dream” through his repeated public criticisms of these kneeling NFL players.</p>
<p>“If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues,” Trump recently tweeted, he or she should not be allowed to kneel. Labeling the protestors actions “disrespectful” to the country, flag and anthem, President Donald Trump has called for players to be fired, encouraged a boycott of the NFL, insisted that the league pass a rule mandating that players stand for the anthem and derided the protestors as “sons of bitches.”</p>
<p>In a dramatic ploy more befitting of a scripted reality television show, the president gloated that he had instructed Vice President Mike Pence to walk out of an Indianapolis Colts game the moment any player kneeled. This was an orchestrated show of power and outrage, designed to send a flamboyant political message given that Trump and Pence knew in advance that on that particular day, the Colts were playing the San Francisco 49ers – the team that currently has the most protestors. The NFL’s announcement this week that the league has no plans to penalize protesting players is the most recent event to provoke the president’s fury; taking to social media during the early morning, he once again equated kneeling with “total disrespect” for our country.</p>
<p>As many have pointed out, the president’s moralizing outrage toward the NFL players is selective and deeply flawed – his apparent patriotic loyalty hasn’t stopped the billionaire politician from criticizing the removal of Confederate statues, or attacking a Gold Star family, or mocking Sen. John McCain’s military service.</p>
<div class='nhpullquote right'>By aggressively targeting the NFL players, Trump believes that he is “winning the cultural war,” having made black “millionaire sport athletes his new [Hillary Clinton].”</div>
<p>The NFL players and their defenders have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/10/09/this-is-about-systemic-oppression-eric-reid-becomes-the-voice-of-49ers-protest-with-criticism-of-pence/?utm_term=.2604f4d5523d">repeatedly stated</a> that the protests are intended to highlight racial inequality and oppression. They’ve also explained that their decision to kneel emerged from a desire to protest peacefully and respectfully after a sustained conversation with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/opinion/colin-kaepernick-football-protests.html">military veterans</a>.</p>
<p>Trump has chosen to ignore these rationales and the structural issues of inequality that motivate the protests and instead, advance a narrative exclusively concerned with overt displays of American patriotism and the “privilege” of the NFL players. As one of president’s advisors explained, by aggressively targeting the NFL players, Trump believes that he is “winning the cultural war,” having made black “millionaire sport athletes his new [Hillary Clinton].”</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/column-americas-sport-nfl-cannot-escape-politics/">READ MORE: As ‘America’s sport,’ the NFL cannot escape politics</a></strong></p>
<p>It’s a cynical statement, revealing the president&#8217;s perception of the jingoism of his base of supporters who envision him as a crusader for American values and symbols.</p>
<p>In casting the black protestors as the antithesis of all of this, Trump has marked the players as unpatriotic elites and enemies of the nation. For a president who has consistently fumbled his way through domestic and foreign policy since he was elected, a culture war between “hard-working” and “virtuous” working-class and middle-class white Americans and rich, ungrateful black football players is a welcome public distraction.</p>
<p>Trump’s attacks on the NFL protestors are rooted in those competing tensions inherent to the American Dream: that wealth equals freedom; that economic privilege demands patriotic gratitude; and most importantly, that black people’s individual economic prosperity invalidates their concerns about systemic injustice and requires their silence on racial oppression.</p>
<p>Among the protestors’ detractors, this has become a common line of attack, a means of disparaging the black NFL players’ activism by pointing to their apparent wealth. The fact that systemic racism is demonstrably real and that individual prosperity does not make one immune to racial discrimination appears to be lost on the protestors’ critics.</p>
<p>Theirs is a grievance that suggests that black athletes should be grateful to live in this country; that racism can’t exist in America since black professional athletes are allowed to play and sign contracts for considerable sums of money; that black players owe the nation their silence since America “gave” them opportunity and access; that black athletes have no moral authority on issues of race and inequality because of their individual success; and that black athletes’ success was never theirs to earn, but instead, was given to them and can just as easily be taken away.</p>
<div class='nhpullquote right'>Black athletes have long been hyper-aware of their peculiar place in American society: beloved for their talents, yet reviled the moment they use their public platform to protest.</div>
<p>This culture war being waged over black athletes is not new. Black athletes – and entertainers – have long been hyper-aware of their peculiar place in American society as individuals beloved for their athletic and artistic talents, yet reviled the moment they use their public platform to protest systemic racial inequality. The parallels between the #TakeAKnee protests and the protests of <a href="https://s-usih.org/2017/09/muhammad-ali-yes-trump-no/">Muhammad Ali</a> or John Carlos and <a href="https://theundefeated.com/features/john-carlos-john-wooten-know-kaepernicks-road-is-a-long-one/">Tommie Smith</a> are readily apparent; so too are there important similarities to the case of <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-paul-robeson-said-77742433/">Paul Robeson</a>.</p>
<p>An outspoken civil rights activist, collegiate and professional football player, lawyer, opera singer and actor, Robeson had his passport revoked in 1950 because of his political activism and speech – actions that all but destroyed his career. The star athlete and entertainer, “who had exemplified American upward mobility” quickly “became public enemy number one” as institutions cancelled his concerts, the public called for his death and anti-Robeson mobs burned effigies of him.</p>
<p>During a 1956 congressional hearing, the chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities beat a familiar refrain with Robeson, challenging the entertainer’s accusations of American racism and racial oppression. He saw no sign of prejudice, he argued, since Robeson was privileged, having gone to elite universities and playing collegiate and professional football.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/poll-americans-divided-nfl-protests/">READ MORE: Poll: Americans divided on NFL protests</a></strong></p>

They also understand that their wealth and success is precarious and is often dependent not only upon their athletic performance, but also upon them remaining silent on issues of racial injustice, especially those that appear to question the “American Dream” or implicate the American public by association. </p>

<p>What would it take to turn Texas, a Republican stronghold, into a blue state? According to data from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/05/upshot/gun-ownership-partisan-divide.html?_r=1">SurveyMonkey</a>, just remove all the gun owners from the Lone Star State and it would have gone to Hillary Clinton in 2016. You can do the same thing in liberal California. Remove all the non-gun owners and the state would have voted for Donald Trump.</p>
<p>That’s how divisive the issue of gun control is in American politics.</p>
<p>SurveyMonkey found that no other demographic &#8212; not race, religion or gender &#8212; so perfectly divided voters. In the 2016 election, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/las-vegas-shooting/why-geography-stops-gun-control-taking-root-n808771">47 percent</a> of Trump supporters said gun control was an issue important enough to influence their vote. That’s compared to just 27 percent of voters who supported Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>But what does this divide mean? How is it impacting gun control policy, and how might this issue change in light of recent mass shootings like Las Vegas, Orlando and Newtown?

<p>WASHINGTON — After her Army son died in an armored vehicle rollover in Syria in May, Sheila Murphy says, she got no call or letter from President Donald Trump, even as she waited months for his condolences, wrote to him to say &#8220;some days I don&#8217;t want to live,&#8221; and still heard nothing.</p>
<p>In contrast, Trump called to comfort Eddie and Aldene Lee about 10 days after their Army son was killed in an explosion while on patrol in Iraq in April. &#8220;Lovely young man,&#8221; Trump said, according to Aldene. She thought that was a beautiful word to hear about her boy, &#8220;lovely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like presidents before him, Trump has made personal contact with some families of the fallen, not all. What&#8217;s different is that Trump, alone among them, has picked a political fight over who&#8217;s done better to honor the war dead and their families.</p>
<p>He placed himself at the top of this pantheon, boasting Tuesday that &#8220;I think I&#8217;ve called every family of someone who&#8217;s died&#8221; while past presidents didn&#8217;t place such calls.</p>
<p>But The Associated Press found relatives of two soldiers who died overseas during Trump&#8217;s presidency who said they never received a call or a letter from him, as well as relatives of a third who did not get a call. And proof is plentiful that Barack Obama and George W. Bush — saddled with far more combat casualties than the roughly two dozen so far under Trump, took painstaking steps to write, call or meet bereaved military families.</p>
<p>The subject arose because nearly two weeks passed before Trump called the families of four U.S. soldiers who were killed in Niger nearly two weeks ago. He made the calls Tuesday.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/trump-ignites-furor-claim-past-presidents-didnt-console-military-families-phone/"><strong>READ MORE: Trump ignites furor with claim past presidents didn’t console military families by phone</strong></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rep. Frederica Wilson said late Tuesday that Trump told the widow of a slain soldier that he &#8220;knew what he signed up for.&#8221; Early Wednesday, the president called Wilson&#8217;s version of the conversation a fabrication.</p>
<p>The Florida Democrat said she was in the car with Myeshia Johnson on the way to Miami International Airport to meet the body of Johnson&#8217;s husband, Sgt. La David Johnson, when Trump called. Wilson says she heard part of the conversation on speakerphone.</p>
<p>When asked by Miami station WPLG if she indeed heard Trump say that she answered: &#8220;Yeah, he said that. To me, that is something that you can say in a conversation, but you shouldn&#8217;t say that to a grieving widow.&#8221; She added: &#8220;That&#8217;s so insensitive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump took strong issue with that recounting early Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!&#8221; he said on Twitter.</p>
<p>Sgt. Johnson was among four servicemen killed in the Niger ambush.</p>
<p>Wilson said that she didn&#8217;t hear the entire conversation and Myeshia Johnson told her she couldn&#8217;t remember everything that was said.</p>
<p>The White House didn&#8217;t immediately comment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/trumps-claim-predecessors-fallen-troops-disputed/"><strong>READ MORE: Trump’s claim about predecessors, fallen troops disputed</strong></a></p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s delay in publicly discussing the men lost at Niger did not appear to be extraordinary, judging from past examples, but his politicization of the matter is. He went so far Tuesday as to cite the death of chief of staff John Kelly&#8217;s son in Afghanistan to question whether Obama had properly honored the war dead.</p>
<p>Kelly was a Marine general under Obama when his Marine son Robert died in 2010. &#8220;You could ask General Kelly, did he get a call from Obama?&#8221; Trump said on Fox News radio.</p>
<p>Democrats and some former government officials were livid, accusing Trump of &#8220;inane cruelty&#8221; and a &#8220;sick game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, an Iraq veteran who lost both legs when her helicopter was attacked, said: &#8220;I just wish that this commander in chief would stop using Gold Star families as pawns in whatever sick game he&#8217;s trying to play here.&#8221;</p>
<p>For their part, Gold Star families, which have lost members in wartime, told AP of acts of intimate kindness from Obama and Bush when those commanders in chief consoled them.</p>
<p>Trump initially claimed that only he among presidents made sure to call families. Obama may have done so on occasion, he said, but &#8220;other presidents did not call.&#8221;</p>
<p>He equivocated Tuesday as the record made plain that his characterization was false. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said of past calls. But he said his own practice was to call all families of the war dead.</p>
<p>But that hasn&#8217;t happened:</p>
<p>No White House protocol demands that presidents speak or meet with the families of Americans killed in action — an impossible task in a war&#8217;s bloodiest stages. But they often do.</p>
<p>Altogether some 6,900 Americans have been killed in overseas wars since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the overwhelming majority under Bush and Obama.</p>
<p>Despite the much heavier toll on his watch — more than 800 dead each year from 2004 through 2007 — Bush wrote to all bereaved military families and met or spoke with hundreds if not thousands, said his spokesman, Freddy Ford.</p>
<p>Veterans groups said they had no quarrel with how presidents have recognized the fallen or their families.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there is any president I know of who hasn&#8217;t called families,&#8221; said Rick Weidman, co-founder and executive director of Vietnam Veterans of America. &#8220;President Obama called often and President Bush called often. They also made regular visits to Walter Reed and Bethesda Medical Center, going in the evenings and on Saturdays.&#8221;</p>

She thought that was a beautiful word to hear about her boy, &#8220;lovely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like presidents before him, Trump has made personal contact with some families of the fallen, not all. What&#8217;s different is that Trump, alone among them, has picked a political fight over who&#8217;s done better to honor the war dead and their families.</p>
<p>He placed himself at the top of this pantheon, boasting Tuesday that &#8220;I think I&#8217;ve called every family of someone who&#8217;s died&#8221; while past presidents didn&#8217;t place such calls.</p>
<p>But The Associated Press found relatives of two soldiers who died overseas during Trump&#8217;s presidency who said they never received a call or a letter from him, as well as relatives of a third who did not get a call. And proof is plentiful that Barack Obama and George W. Bush — saddled with far more combat casualties than the roughly two dozen so far under Trump, took painstaking steps to write, call or meet bereaved military families.</p>
<p>The subject arose because nearly two weeks passed before Trump called the families of four U.S. soldiers who were killed in Niger nearly two weeks ago. He made the calls Tuesday.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/trump-ignites-furor-claim-past-presidents-didnt-console-military-families-phone/"><strong>READ MORE: Trump ignites furor with claim past presidents didn’t console military families by phone</strong></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rep. Frederica Wilson said late Tuesday that Trump told the widow of a slain soldier that he &#8220;knew what he signed up for.&#8221; Early Wednesday, the president called Wilson&#8217;s version of the conversation a fabrication.</p>
<p>The Florida Democrat said she was in the car with Myeshia Johnson on the way to Miami International Airport to meet the body of Johnson&#8217;s husband, Sgt. La David Johnson, when Trump called. Wilson says she heard part of the conversation on speakerphone.</p>
<p>When asked by Miami station WPLG if she indeed heard Trump say that she answered: &#8220;Yeah, he said that. To me, that is something that you can say in a conversation, but you shouldn&#8217;t say that to a grieving widow.&#8221; She added: &#8220;That&#8217;s so insensitive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump took strong issue with that recounting early Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!&#8221; he said on Twitter.</p>
<p>Sgt. Johnson was among four servicemen killed in the Niger ambush.</p>
<p>Wilson said that she didn&#8217;t hear the entire conversation and Myeshia Johnson told her she couldn&#8217;t remember everything that was said.</p>
<p>The White House didn&#8217;t immediately comment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/trumps-claim-predecessors-fallen-troops-disputed/"><strong>READ MORE: Trump’s claim about predecessors, fallen troops disputed</strong></a></p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s delay in publicly discussing the men lost at Niger did not appear to be extraordinary, judging from past examples, but his politicization of the matter is. He went so far Tuesday as to cite the death of chief of staff John Kelly&#8217;s son in Afghanistan to question whether Obama had properly honored the war dead.</p>
<p>Kelly was a Marine general under Obama when his Marine son Robert died in 2010. &#8220;You could ask General Kelly, did he get a call from Obama?&#8221; Trump said on Fox News radio.</p>
<p>Democrats and some former government officials were livid, accusing Trump of &#8220;inane cruelty&#8221; and a &#8220;sick game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, an Iraq veteran who lost both legs when her helicopter was attacked, said: &#8220;I just wish that this commander in chief would stop using Gold Star families as pawns in whatever sick game he&#8217;s trying to play here.&#8221;</p>
<p>For their part, Gold Star families, which have lost members in wartime, told AP of acts of intimate kindness from Obama and Bush when those commanders in chief consoled them.</p>
<p>Trump initially claimed that only he among presidents made sure to call families. Obama may have done so on occasion, he said, but &#8220;other presidents did not call.&#8221;</p>
<p>He equivocated Tuesday as the record made plain that his characterization was false. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said of past calls. But he said his own practice was to call all families of the war dead.</p>
<p>But that hasn&#8217;t happened:</p>
<p>No White House protocol demands that presidents speak or meet with the families of Americans killed in action — an impossible task in a war&#8217;s bloodiest stages. But they often do.</p>
<p>Altogether some 6,900 Americans have been killed in overseas wars since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the overwhelming majority under Bush and Obama.</p>
<p>Despite the much heavier toll on his watch — more than 800 dead each year from 2004 through 2007 — Bush wrote to all bereaved military families and met or spoke with hundreds if not thousands, said his spokesman, Freddy Ford.</p>
<p>Veterans groups said they had no quarrel with how presidents have recognized the fallen or their families.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there is any president I know of who hasn&#8217;t called families,&#8221; said Rick Weidman, co-founder and executive director of Vietnam Veterans of America. &#8220;President Obama called often and President Bush called often. They also made regular visits to Walter Reed and Bethesda Medical Center, going in the evenings and on Saturdays.&#8221;</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — When Karen Pence found out that an art therapist in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico couldn&#8217;t afford the clay her clients needed, she sprang into action.</p>
<p>A trained watercolor artist and advocate of the little-known mental health profession, Vice President Mike Pence&#8217;s wife went to the Virginia art supply store she frequented when they lived in the state during his tenure in Congress, bought 120 pounds of self-drying clay and packed it aboard Air Force Two for their flight down to survey the damage.</p>
<p>&#8220;She cleaned him out,&#8221; the vice president said of the store&#8217;s owner.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pence made art therapy her cause ever since she first learned about it more than a decade ago. She has visited numerous art therapy programs, both in the U.S. and abroad, and on Wednesday in Florida, nine months into the administration, she planned to formally announce the goals for her art therapy initiative.</p>
<p>She wants to help people understand the difference between art therapy and arts and crafts, and to grasp that art therapy is a viable option for treating trauma, injury and other life experiences. She also wants to encourage young people to choose art therapy as a career.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that a lot of people understand the difference between therapeutic art and art therapy,&#8221; Mrs. Pence, a trained watercolor artist, told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview before the announcement at Florida State University in Tallahassee. The school has an art therapy program she described as &#8220;tremendous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blabbing to a girlfriend can be therapeutic, she explained, but it is not the same as art therapy, which has three elements: a client, a trained therapist and art.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/vp-pences-wife-aims-raise-awareness-art-therapy/"><strong>READ MORE: VP Pence’s wife aims to raise awareness about art therapy</strong></a></p>
<p>As passionate as she is about raising art therapy&#8217;s profile, other issues help make Karen Pence tick, too.</p>
<p>One of them is helping military families, especially spouses. Her only son, Michael, is in the Marines.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also her interest in honeybees. Mrs. Pence installed a beehive on the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory, where the vice president&#8217;s official residence is located, to help call attention to a decline in managed bee colonies that officials say could negatively affect U.S. agricultural production. She had a beehive at the Indiana governor&#8217;s residence for the same reason.</p>
<p>Now 60 and married to the vice president since 1985, Mrs. Pence has long been viewed as one of her husband&#8217;s most trusted political advisers. They are often together on trips, at the White House, or at the observatory, almost always holding hands.</p>
<p>Since returning to Washington in January (the family lived in the area when her husband served in Congress), she has accompanied the vice president on goodwill tours of Europe, Asia and Latin America, as well as trips to survey recent hurricane damage in Texas, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. She tries to visit art therapy programs wherever she goes. Journalists who travel with Pence often keep an eye out for his wife; she often brings them cookies when he ventures back to the press cabin for small talk.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/devastated-puerto-rico-needs-unprecedented-aid-says-governor/"><strong>READ MORE: Devastated Puerto Rico needs unprecedented aid, says governor</strong></a></p>
<p>She&#8217;s even done a little campaigning, urging Virginians to vote next month for Ed Gillespie in what&#8217;s viewed as a tight gubernatorial race.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really makes a difference, I can tell you. Nobody thought that we were going to win,&#8221; she said, an apparent reference to the Trump-Pence ticket.</p>
<p>The vice president often refers to his wife as the family&#8217;s &#8220;prayer captain.&#8221; She has led congregations in prayer during their hurricane-damage trips.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re people of faith so we just try and approach everything with prayer,&#8221; Mrs. Pence said from her sunny, second-floor office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in the White House complex, where she and her staff enjoy coveted views of the Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial. Art therapy drawings given as gifts adorn the outer office.</p>
<p>She proudly displayed several of her paintings, including of the Capitol dome, the vice president&#8217;s residence, a Ball canning jar-turned-flower vase, a cardinal bird and a pink peony. She turns many of her watercolors into prints and boxed notecards that she gifts to art therapists she meets.</p>
<p>Except for myriad pets, including two cats, a dog and a rabbit named Marlon Bundo, the Pences are empty nesters. Their son and two adult daughters are off on their own.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think for us this is a good time in our life for this role because our kids are out of college. They&#8217;re living their own lives,&#8221; Mrs. Pence said.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s also launching a blog in conjunction with Wednesday&#8217;s announcement to chronicle her visits to art therapy programs.</p>

<p>A new verbal battle has broken out between the president and Republican Senator John McCain. It began last night in Philadelphia, when the Arizona senator and former Vietnam POW appeared to criticize Mr. Trump and his followers. He cited a list of failings.</p>
<p><strong>SEN. JOHN MCCAIN,</strong> R-Ariz.: To fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters-of-a-century, to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.</p>
<p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> The president answered by saying, &#8220;At some point, I fight back, and it won&#8217;t be pretty.&#8221;</p>
<p>In turn, McCain said, &#8220;I have faced tougher adversaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, Taliban bombings and shootings left at least 74 people dead today. The worst was Paktika province in the east, where two car bombs killed dozens, including the provincial police chief, and wounded more than 100 others. Taliban militants also staged attacks in the south and west of the country.</p>
<p>In Syria, militia forces backed by the U.S. say they have retaken the Islamic State group&#8217;s de facto capital. The city of Raqqa had been under ISIS control since 2014. The battle to recapture it began in June. Today, Kurdish-led fighters celebrated as they moved into the city center. The U.S. military said 90 percent of Raqqa has been taken, with pockets of militants remaining.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s word that U.S. airstrikes in Yemen killed dozens of Islamic State fighters on Monday. The strikes were apparently carried out by drones. The Pentagon says the targets were training camps for recruits.</p>
<p>In Northern Iraq, Kurdish forces withdrew from more territory today, as Iraqi government troops advanced. It came on the heels of the Kurds&#8217; vote for independence. Federal forces and allied militia had already forced the Kurds to leave the area in and around Kirkuk and its oil fields.</p>
<p>Iraq&#8217;s prime minister said that paves the way for talks.</p>
<p><strong>HAIDER AL-ABADI, </strong>Prime Minister, Iraq (through interpreter): I call for dialogue on the basis of partnership in one country and under the Constitution. The referendum is finished and has become a thing from the past. We hoped that they would cancel it, but we have finished it on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Meanwhile, the president of Iraqi Kurdistan, Massoud Barzani, insisted that the referendum will not be in vain.</p>
<p>Another 10,000 to 15,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Buddhist Myanmar for Bangladesh over the weekend. Drone video showed snaking lines of refugees making the trek to already crowded camps. Many told of villages torched by mobs and soldiers. Others said they were starved out of their homes.</p>
<p>Back in this country, a new fire broke out in the San Francisco Bay Area, just as crews had made major progress against other fires in Northern California. Thick smoke billowed from the new site early today, as it burned through forests in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Weary fire crews said they&#8217;re calling in more help.</p>
<p><strong>ROB SHERMAN,</strong> Division Chief, Cal Fire: So, the idea is to hit it pretty hard with aircraft and then go ahead and hit it with the ground resources at the same time. We have had north winds, a lot of drying, and everything&#8217;s really, really dry. So it&#8217;s challenging.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> In Southern California, yet another fire spread on Mount Wilson, about 25 miles north of downtown Los Angeles. It threatened a historic observatory and communications towers.</p>
<p>President Trump&#8217;s overall wealth has taken a hit, as his New York real estate loses some of its luster. Forbes ranks him 248 this year on its list of the 400 wealthiest Americans. That&#8217;s down nearly 100 points from last year. His estimated worth is $3.1 billion.</p>
<p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates again tops the list. He&#8217;s worth nearly $90 billion.</p>
<p>And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average traded above 23,000 for the first time. In the end, it gained 40 points to close at 22997. The Nasdaq fell a fraction, and the S&amp;P 500 added one point.</p>

<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> The president answered by saying, &#8220;At some point, I fight back, and it won&#8217;t be pretty.&#8221;</p>
<p>In turn, McCain said, &#8220;I have faced tougher adversaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, Taliban bombings and shootings left at least 74 people dead today. The worst was Paktika province in the east, where two car bombs killed dozens, including the provincial police chief, and wounded more than 100 others. Taliban militants also staged attacks in the south and west of the country.</p>
<p>In Syria, militia forces backed by the U.S. say they have retaken the Islamic State group&#8217;s de facto capital. The city of Raqqa had been under ISIS control since 2014. The battle to recapture it began in June. Today, Kurdish-led fighters celebrated as they moved into the city center. The U.S. military said 90 percent of Raqqa has been taken, with pockets of militants remaining.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s word that U.S. airstrikes in Yemen killed dozens of Islamic State fighters on Monday. The strikes were apparently carried out by drones. The Pentagon says the targets were training camps for recruits.</p>
<p>In Northern Iraq, Kurdish forces withdrew from more territory today, as Iraqi government troops advanced. It came on the heels of the Kurds&#8217; vote for independence. Federal forces and allied militia had already forced the Kurds to leave the area in and around Kirkuk and its oil fields.</p>
<p>Iraq&#8217;s prime minister said that paves the way for talks.</p>
<p><strong>HAIDER AL-ABADI, </strong>Prime Minister, Iraq (through interpreter): I call for dialogue on the basis of partnership in one country and under the Constitution. The referendum is finished and has become a thing from the past. We hoped that they would cancel it, but we have finished it on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Meanwhile, the president of Iraqi Kurdistan, Massoud Barzani, insisted that the referendum will not be in vain.</p>
<p>Another 10,000 to 15,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Buddhist Myanmar for Bangladesh over the weekend. Drone video showed snaking lines of refugees making the trek to already crowded camps. Many told of villages torched by mobs and soldiers. Others said they were starved out of their homes.</p>
<p>Back in this country, a new fire broke out in the San Francisco Bay Area, just as crews had made major progress against other fires in Northern California. Thick smoke billowed from the new site early today, as it burned through forests in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Weary fire crews said they&#8217;re calling in more help.</p>
<p><strong>ROB SHERMAN,</strong> Division Chief, Cal Fire: So, the idea is to hit it pretty hard with aircraft and then go ahead and hit it with the ground resources at the same time. We have had north winds, a lot of drying, and everything&#8217;s really, really dry. So it&#8217;s challenging.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> In Southern California, yet another fire spread on Mount Wilson, about 25 miles north of downtown Los Angeles. It threatened a historic observatory and communications towers.</p>
<p>President Trump&#8217;s overall wealth has taken a hit, as his New York real estate loses some of its luster. Forbes ranks him 248 this year on its list of the 400 wealthiest Americans. That&#8217;s down nearly 100 points from last year. His estimated worth is $3.1 billion.</p>
<p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates again tops the list. He&#8217;s worth nearly $90 billion.</p>
<p>And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average traded above 23,000 for the first time. In the end, it gained 40 points to close at 22997. The Nasdaq fell a fraction, and the S&amp;P 500 added one point.</p>

<p>John Yang has the story.</p>
<p><strong>JOHN YANG:</strong> Sending young Americans into harm&#8217;s way can be the most serious decision a president makes. Consoling the families of the fallen has become the latest controversy to engulf President Trump.</p>
<p>To bolster his claim that he does more than his predecessors, Mr. Trump today invoked the dead son of his chief of staff, retired Marine general John Kelly.</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP</strong>: To the best of my knowledge, I think I have called every family of somebody that&#8217;s died. Now, as far as other representatives, I don&#8217;t know. I mean, you could ask General Kelly, did he get a call from Obama?</p>
<p><strong>JOHN YANG:</strong> Kelly&#8217;s 29-year-old son, Robert, a Marine lieutenant, was killed in 2010 when he stepped on a land mine in Afghanistan, an episode Kelly rarely talks about publicly. Kelly and his wife did attend a 2011 Memorial Day breakfast President Obama hosted for Gold Star families.</p>
<p>President Trump ignited the furor when he was asked about his public silence on four Green Berets killed two weeks ago in Niger.</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:</strong> If you look at President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn&#8217;t make calls. A lot of them didn&#8217;t make calls. I like to call when it&#8217;s appropriate, when I think I&#8217;m able to do it.</p>
<p><strong>JOHN YANG:</strong> Reporters pressed him to back up the claim.</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:</strong> I don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s what I was told. All I can do &#8212; all I can do is ask my generals.</p>
<p><strong>JOHN YANG:</strong> The response from former Obama officials was swift and forceful.</p>
<p>Former Attorney General Eric Holder tweeted this photo and insisted: &#8220;Stop the damn lying. I went to Dover Air Force base with 44 and saw him comfort families,&#8221; a reference to one of Mr. Obama&#8217;s late-night trips to pay his respects to troops killed in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama and President George W. Bush often visited wounded warriors at Walter Reed and Bethesda hospitals, a practice Mr. Trump has continued. In February, the president and his daughter Ivanka went to Dover for the return of the remains of a Navy SEAL killed in Yemen, the first casualty of his administration.</p>
<p>So far this year, the Pentagon says 16 Americans have been killed in action. Another 17 sailors died in accidents. In the first year of the Obama presidency, 344 were killed in action.</p>
<p>During last year&#8217;s campaign, Mr. Trump publicly feuded with the Khans, the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq, after they criticized him at the Democratic Convention.</p>
<p>Today, the Khans said: &#8220;President Trump&#8217;s selfish and divisive actions have undermined the dignity of the high office of the presidency.&#8221;</p>
<p>The current controversy comes as questions are being raised about how and why the four soldiers died in Niger.</p>
<p>Senator Jack Reed is the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.</p>
<p><strong>SEN. JACK REED,</strong> D-R.I.: I think the administration has to be much more clear about our role in Niger and our role in other areas in Africa and other parts of the globe.</p>
<p><strong>JOHN YANG:</strong> The Pentagon is investigating the deaths. Reportedly among the questions, did commanders adequately assess the risk, and was there ready access to medical support?</p>

The island and its residents are still coming to grips with the scale of the devastation.</p>
<p>William Brangham brings us the latest.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> Many Puerto Ricans are still in the dark, without electrical power. Hundreds of thousands still have no access to running water, and the rebuilding of the countless damaged homes, roads and facilities is just beginning.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported yesterday that almost half the sewage treatment plants on the island are still out of service, increasing the risk of contamination and disease.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m joined now by David Begnaud. He&#8217;s a correspondent from CBS News who&#8217;s been doing some very strong reporting there from since when the storm hit, and is just back from his latest trip to the island.</p>
<p>David, welcome to the NewsHour.</p>
<p>I wonder. We saw many of your reports and others of people still three weeks out from the storm who are still drinking from streams and creeks. You heard &#8212; I mentioned this AP report about fears of contamination.</p>
<p>Can you just tell us what is going on there? How are people getting water now?</p>
<p><strong>DAVID BEGNAUD,</strong> CBS News: Well, let me tell you this.</p>
<p>The governor of Puerto Rico said this morning that he&#8217;s aware of those reports and that they&#8217;re looking into it. What&#8217;s concerning, William, is that three weeks after the storm and at least a week after the allegations first surfaced that people might be trying to drink from toxic wells at what&#8217;s known as Superfund sites, the governor of Puerto Rico is still saying, we&#8217;re looking into it and telling people to stay out of rivers where sewage may be spilling into the river.</p>
<p>And, he said, we want them to stay away from the coastal areas.</p>
<p>How are people doing? They&#8217;re still desperate to get water. No one seems to be able to figure out how to get enough water to every single person on that island who needs it. And as long as people need water, it&#8217;s still an emergency phase.</p>
<p>Nearly four weeks later, no one seems to be able to move from the emergency to the recovery.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> So, people who are &#8212; we see them drinking out of these PVC pipes that they have kind of rigged and sort of poked into the side of a creek.</p>
<p>People are just drinking that water straight, without purification, without boiling it; is that right?</p>
<p><strong>DAVID BEGNAUD:</strong> Absolutely.</p>
<p>Look, they have got the PVC pipes tapped into the mountains so that it&#8217;s coming out of the stream that way. And they literally are &#8212; I saw a woman walk up to a potable water tank that the military had brought in, and she had a Clorox bottle.</p>
<p>And I said, &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, you&#8217;re putting drinkable water in a Clorox bottle?&#8221;</p>
<p>And she said, &#8220;It&#8217;s all I have got.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, that was a good scenario. The other scenarios are people right now who are drinking from streams and creeks and rivers who have no water filters, who have nothing, right? They&#8217;re just taking this water.</p>
<p>Now, listen, the government got a million water-purifying tablets within the last week. It took almost three weeks to get those. Now there&#8217;s a large push to bring in water filters.</p>
<p>I have got to tell you, most of the water filters I&#8217;m seeing brought in are coming from the private sector, and civilian samaritans who are getting 1,000 or more from the mainland and flying them over to Puerto Rico and personally hand-delivering them.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> That&#8217;s really incredible.</p>
<p>Medical facilities were another big &#8212; just a huge devastation on the island. I know you have been doing a lot of reporting on the USS Comfort.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID BEGNAUD:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> This is the huge Naval hospital that is now just offshore Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>But I understand it hasn&#8217;t been fully utilized. Can you tell us what your reporting has found there?</p>
<p><strong>DAVID BEGNAUD:</strong> The two men running the ship told us that nearly 87 percent of the ship is empty. Sounds alarming, right? They have 200 beds, and 87 percent are empty.</p>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s what they said: We stand ready for whatever the government wants to do. We are waiting to be told by the government.</p>
<p>So, I went to the governor, and said exactly what&#8217;s happening. And he said: &#8220;Look, I&#8217;m not satisfied with what the protocol was from the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said, initially, they were prioritizing only the most critically ill patients go to the Comfort. And he said there was a layered process that was complicating things.</p>
<p>So, the governor, Ricardo Rossello, said: &#8220;I started to take out some of those layers, and I, said, listen, take people on the ship who may not be critically ill, but need good medical care and can&#8217;t get it at the hospital, where the lights are flickering and the A.C. is not running.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what the governor said.</p>
<p>Within a matter of hours, I got a tweet from a third-year medical student who said: &#8220;Let me tell you what a nightmare it has been to reach the Comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We have got a pediatric patient who desperately needs to get off this island, either to a hospital on the mainland or to the Comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he said: &#8220;I went through Google and the local newspaper to find the number. I couldn&#8217;t find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, here is how things work. Within about 30 minutes of that tweet going out and that medical student&#8217;s story being posted, the governor&#8217;s spokesperson responded with numbers that should be able to help.</p>
<p>The bottom line here, William, is that asking relentless questions and the good work of journalism is what&#8217;s making a difference there. It&#8217;s no one person. There&#8217;s no heroic work that&#8217;s being done by any journalist, other than people who are going back to the same officials and asking some of the same questions, relentlessly seeking the right answer that will make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> One of the other pieces of reporting that you did that was very early in the story was this backlog of supplies trapped in container ships on the ports in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>I understand some of that &#8212; some of those supplies are now moving. Can you tell us, are they getting to where they need to be throughout the island?</p>
<p><strong>DAVID BEGNAUD:</strong> So, the shipping containers you&#8217;re talking about, about 3,000 sitting in the Port of San Juan, have been moved out, not all of them, but a majority of them.</p>
<p>And they were intended for grocery stores around the island. Right? So, those were private companies that had brought in these shipping containers, paid for the supplies, but couldn&#8217;t move them because their truck drivers were either at home, because the home had been destroyed, or the road was impassable.</p>
<p>More and more supplies are getting out. But let me tell you, the grocery stores around the island, they have a lot of nonperishables, Pringles, candy, cookies, all on the shelf.</p>
<p>But when you go to the meat section, it&#8217;s nearly 75 percent empty at the stores we have been to, the produce section 90 percent empty. And finding bottled water there is almost like playing a game.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> David Begnaud, CBS News, thank you so much for your reporting. Thanks for your time.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID BEGNAUD:</strong> You bet.</p>

<p>How are people doing? They&#8217;re still desperate to get water. No one seems to be able to figure out how to get enough water to every single person on that island who needs it. And as long as people need water, it&#8217;s still an emergency phase.</p>
<p>Nearly four weeks later, no one seems to be able to move from the emergency to the recovery.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> So, people who are &#8212; we see them drinking out of these PVC pipes that they have kind of rigged and sort of poked into the side of a creek.</p>
<p>People are just drinking that water straight, without purification, without boiling it; is that right?</p>
<p><strong>DAVID BEGNAUD:</strong> Absolutely.</p>
<p>Look, they have got the PVC pipes tapped into the mountains so that it&#8217;s coming out of the stream that way. And they literally are &#8212; I saw a woman walk up to a potable water tank that the military had brought in, and she had a Clorox bottle.</p>
<p>And I said, &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, you&#8217;re putting drinkable water in a Clorox bottle?&#8221;</p>
<p>And she said, &#8220;It&#8217;s all I have got.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, that was a good scenario. The other scenarios are people right now who are drinking from streams and creeks and rivers who have no water filters, who have nothing, right? They&#8217;re just taking this water.</p>
<p>Now, listen, the government got a million water-purifying tablets within the last week. It took almost three weeks to get those. Now there&#8217;s a large push to bring in water filters.</p>
<p>I have got to tell you, most of the water filters I&#8217;m seeing brought in are coming from the private sector, and civilian samaritans who are getting 1,000 or more from the mainland and flying them over to Puerto Rico and personally hand-delivering them.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> That&#8217;s really incredible.</p>
<p>Medical facilities were another big &#8212; just a huge devastation on the island. I know you have been doing a lot of reporting on the USS Comfort.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID BEGNAUD:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> This is the huge Naval hospital that is now just offshore Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>But I understand it hasn&#8217;t been fully utilized. Can you tell us what your reporting has found there?</p>
<p><strong>DAVID BEGNAUD:</strong> The two men running the ship told us that nearly 87 percent of the ship is empty. Sounds alarming, right? They have 200 beds, and 87 percent are empty.</p>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s what they said: We stand ready for whatever the government wants to do. We are waiting to be told by the government.</p>
<p>So, I went to the governor, and said exactly what&#8217;s happening. And he said: &#8220;Look, I&#8217;m not satisfied with what the protocol was from the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said, initially, they were prioritizing only the most critically ill patients go to the Comfort. And he said there was a layered process that was complicating things.</p>
<p>So, the governor, Ricardo Rossello, said: &#8220;I started to take out some of those layers, and I, said, listen, take people on the ship who may not be critically ill, but need good medical care and can&#8217;t get it at the hospital, where the lights are flickering and the A.C. is not running.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what the governor said.</p>
<p>Within a matter of hours, I got a tweet from a third-year medical student who said: &#8220;Let me tell you what a nightmare it has been to reach the Comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We have got a pediatric patient who desperately needs to get off this island, either to a hospital on the mainland or to the Comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he said: &#8220;I went through Google and the local newspaper to find the number. I couldn&#8217;t find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, here is how things work. Within about 30 minutes of that tweet going out and that medical student&#8217;s story being posted, the governor&#8217;s spokesperson responded with numbers that should be able to help.</p>
<p>The bottom line here, William, is that asking relentless questions and the good work of journalism is what&#8217;s making a difference there. It&#8217;s no one person. There&#8217;s no heroic work that&#8217;s being done by any journalist, other than people who are going back to the same officials and asking some of the same questions, relentlessly seeking the right answer that will make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> One of the other pieces of reporting that you did that was very early in the story was this backlog of supplies trapped in container ships on the ports in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>I understand some of that &#8212; some of those supplies are now moving. Can you tell us, are they getting to where they need to be throughout the island?</p>
<p><strong>DAVID BEGNAUD:</strong> So, the shipping containers you&#8217;re talking about, about 3,000 sitting in the Port of San Juan, have been moved out, not all of them, but a majority of them.</p>
<p>And they were intended for grocery stores around the island. Right? So, those were private companies that had brought in these shipping containers, paid for the supplies, but couldn&#8217;t move them because their truck drivers were either at home, because the home had been destroyed, or the road was impassable.</p>
<p>More and more supplies are getting out. But let me tell you, the grocery stores around the island, they have a lot of nonperishables, Pringles, candy, cookies, all on the shelf.</p>
<p>But when you go to the meat section, it&#8217;s nearly 75 percent empty at the stores we have been to, the produce section 90 percent empty. And finding bottled water there is almost like playing a game.</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BRANGHAM:</strong> David Begnaud, CBS News, thank you so much for your reporting. Thanks for your time.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID BEGNAUD:</strong> You bet.</p>

<p>It was first used in 2007, but when actor Alyssa Milano tweeted it Sunday night to talk about sexual harassment and assault in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein story, it went viral. The hashtag was tweeted nearly a million times in just 48 hours. Facebook reported 45 percent of its users have friends who posted #MeToo, as women wrote about their experiences about the workplace and culture, and what should change.</p>
<p>We explore some of those issues with Fatima Goss Graves. She&#8217;s president of the National Women&#8217;s Law Center. Lisa Senecal wrote about her own experience for the online news site Daily Beast. She&#8217;s with the Vermont Commission on Women. And Melissa Silverstein is the founder of the blog and Web site Women and Hollywood.</p>
<p>Thank you all for joining us.</p>
<p>Lisa Senecal, I&#8217;m going to start with you.</p>
<p>You have had a personal experience with sexual harassment. That&#8217;s in part what has drawn you to this #MeToo campaign movement.</p>
<p>Just tell us briefly about what happened.</p>
<p><strong>LISA SENECAL,</strong> Member, Vermont Commission on Women: Sure.</p>
<p>Like most women, I have had a number of experiences with sexual harassment, beginning with my first job, when I was 15 years old. And it&#8217;s really been a threat off and on throughout my entire professional career.</p>
<p>The most egregious offense was an actual assault that occurred with a male executive. Unfortunately, because of an NDA &#8212; and we can go into the evils of nondisclosures another time &#8212; but because of that, there isn&#8217;t a lot that I&#8217;m able to say about the specific event.</p>
<p>But the issue of sexual harassment and finally having this come to the fore, so many women are already familiar with it from being on the receiving end. And I think, especially with the #MeToo campaign, it&#8217;s been really wonderful and an eye-opening experience for men to realize just how pervasive an issue this is.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> So, in your experience, it was a business setting.</p>
<p>Melissa Silverstein, you have been writing about women in Hollywood for 10 years. Of course, that&#8217;s where the Harvey Weinstein story came from.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s been going on in Hollywood forever, why hasn&#8217;t it been talked about more before now?</p>
<p><strong>MELISSA SILVERSTEIN,</strong> Founder, Women and Hollywood: Well, I think there was a culture of silence created around this man and also within this industry.</p>
<p>People were afraid. People are afraid for their jobs. It&#8217;s a very relational industry, where if someone is going to blacklist you, you are not going to get your next job.</p>
<p>So I think the way that a person was able to conduct himself for 30 years like this was to build a culture of fear, to make people sign nondisclosure agreements, and to get them to shut up.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Fatima Goss Graves, here with me in Washington with the National Women&#8217;s Law Center, we have been talking about Hollywood.</p>
<p>We have talking about the business workplace. Is there any field of work where this isn&#8217;t going on?</p>
<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES,</strong> President, National Women&#8217;s Law Center: Right.</p>
<p>The issue of harassment and assault, it&#8217;s a Hollywood problem, but really it&#8217;s an everywhere problem. It infects industries across the board, whether you&#8217;re high-wage jobs, low-wage jobs, male-dominated fields, but also female-dominated fields.</p>
<p>Restaurants are some of the areas where you have some of the highest rates of EEOC charges. And that&#8217;s not a male-dominated field.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> EEOC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p>Lisa Senecal, some people are saying that they&#8217;re uncomfortable with this #MeToo campaign movement because they&#8217;re saying, once again, women are being asked to go public with what happened to them, but there is no promise that there is going to be anything done about it. How do you see this?</p>
<p><strong>LISA SENECAL:</strong> I don&#8217;t necessarily believe that women are being asked to come forward.</p>
<p>I think this is an opportunity to come forward, if that&#8217;s something that women want to do, but there&#8217;s no obligation to do it. And there&#8217;s been a lot of support for letting women know that if this isn&#8217;t something you&#8217;re comfortable with at this time, no one is obligated to tell their story, and no one is allowed to force you to tell your story before you&#8217;re ready.</p>
<p>But the stories are important. Without them, the degree to which this happens across all industries, across genders as well &#8212; we know that this happens to men. This happens to the transgender.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not specific to women, although it affects us most frequently. Until we have a critical mass of women who are able to get the men in their lives, the men that they work with to understand how pervasive a problem it is, and then can get men to begin to act on this, because this isn&#8217;t a women&#8217;s issue.</p>
<p>This is a violence issue, and an issue of power and who has the power. So until the people who still primarily do hold the power, which is primarily men and primarily white men, until they&#8217;re going to begin to act, then the problems are going to persist.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Melissa Silverstein, how do you see that? What is it going to take for this to be a change?</p>
<p><strong>MELISSA SILVERSTEIN:</strong> The fact that we&#8217;re having a global conversation about sexual harassment &#8212; I have been doing media for the last week all over the world.</p>
<p>People are really enthralled by this and want to see change. This is a global issue. And, also, Hollywood is a global industry. Seventy cents of every dollar of Hollywood studio movies are made outside the United States.</p>
<p>So what people are looking for is Hollywood to step up. And, today, we had a leader in Hollywood, Kathleen Kennedy, to say we need to have a commission, cross-industry commission, of people who are going to look into this and put a stop to it once and for all.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> And pick up on that, Fatima Goss Graves. Just across the board, what is it going to take?</p>
<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES:</strong> Right.</p>
<p>We know that there are things that would make a difference here. If employers had processes that their employees actually use, you wouldn&#8217;t have harassment in the shadows. Right now, most people don&#8217;t report harassment to anyone. And it&#8217;s because they think their employers won&#8217;t do anything, or, worse, that they would experience retaliation.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> And that&#8217;s &#8212; because that&#8217;s been what happened.</p>
<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES:</strong> And that is. They&#8217;re right to believe that they will experience retaliation, because they do. They&#8217;re shamed. They&#8217;re blamed.</p>
<p>But employees could make a difference. Right? They can be &#8212; take it seriously and communicate that to their workplace. They can also have the right policies that are in place. And, finally, they could, when someone comes forward, be really clear that they take it seriously and that they will not tolerate retaliation.</p>
<p>Those are things that aren&#8217;t happening among employers frequently enough.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Lisa Senecal, as somebody who had it happen to you in a business environment, what changes need to be made in the workplace? What has to happen?</p>
<p><strong>LISA SENECAL:</strong> Well, I agree completely with what was just said.</p>
<p>Too often, the workplace education that goes on is incredibly insufficient. It&#8217;s more of companies wanting to be able to check the box and say that they did their sexual harassment training. And it isn&#8217;t truly something within the culture of companies that they believe that this is a problem and that it is a right of all people working at that company not to be harassed.</p>
<p>So, until it starts to be taken more seriously, and when a woman or anyone comes forward with an accusation, it does have to be taken so much more seriously. And the knee-jerk response, as was in my case, cannot be to shame the woman, can&#8217;t be to blame her for somehow bringing this on herself, and putting women back in a position of being victimized a second time because they&#8217;re not taken seriously when they come forward.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Melissa Silverstein, yes, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>MELISSA SILVERSTEIN:</strong> I just wanted to add, one of the things that&#8217;s so fundamental about this is how this &#8212; how it&#8217;s so normalized for all of us to go through this kind of harassment, especially in Hollywood, and how people kind of laugh off, oh, you know, that&#8217;s locker room talk, or, you know, this is the movie business, get used to it.</p>
<p>And what we need to do is really pierce that veil of the normalization of this kind of conduct, because it starts with, you know, the comments, and then it can escalate very quickly.</p>
<p>So we really need to just change people&#8217;s attitudes and get rid of the toxic masculinity. Hollywood has no much institutionalized sexism that sometimes I feel like we need to just start over, if possible.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Joining us also is Leigh Gilmore, a professor at Wellesley College who&#8217;s written a book about why &#8212; titled &#8220;Why We Doubt What Women Say About Their Lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh Gilmore, why don&#8217;t women &#8212; why haven&#8217;t women been believed and taken seriously on this, and could we now be at a moment when they are?</p>
<p><strong>LEIGH GILMORE,</strong> Wellesley College: It&#8217;s good to be with you, Judy.</p>
<p>I think we have a persistent and a pervasive culture of doubting what women say, especially when they&#8217;re bringing forward accounts of harm into the public sphere. So we have these pre-made default cultural narratives of women&#8217;s unreliability. We have he said/she said, which is a false equivalence narrative.</p>
<p>We have that notion that nobody knows what really happened. We have that notion that you can&#8217;t really trust what women say. None of these are based in fact, but they are part of a kind of cloud that enables us to doubt any woman before she speaks up.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s quite intimidating. And so, if we&#8217;re at a point of change, we really are at a moment where I think we have a new level of visibility, and we have the opportunity to amplify the voices of women who are speaking out.</p>
<p>So, insofar as we have that opportunity, there is a form of solidarity, and more women speaking can lead to change.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Fatima Goss Graves, as somebody who works on these issues from a legal standpoint, are we, could we be at a watershed point, or is it just a whole lot more complicated?</p>
<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES:</strong> Well, the culture change typically has to go together with both the enforcement of the laws and the policy change.</p>
<p>And so we&#8217;re at a tipping point, surely, on culture change. But I will tell you, you know, the National Women&#8217;s Law Center runs a hot line. And over the last two weeks, we have had double the intake on harassment.</p>
<p>And we have a new network called the Legal Network for Gender Equity, so we&#8217;re &#8212; attorneys are joining with us and will be ready to take these cases. But those people who are making these calls and contacting us, I think that that shows that you have people who are ready to come forward on social media, and there is power there, but it seems like there are people who are ready to come forward in other ways, too.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> I want to quickly go around and ask each one of you about the role of men in all of this.</p>
<p>Lisa Senecal?</p>
<p><strong>LISA SENECAL:</strong> Oh, I think it&#8217;s critical for men as allies to be coming forward and supporting women who do come forward.</p>
<p>Men also need to be willing to call out other men, whether that&#8217;s one-on-one, whether it&#8217;s in a group setting within a company, or socially. If a man hears, sees someone doing something inappropriate, they need to have the courage to stand up, even in front of other men, and say, it&#8217;s not OK, it&#8217;s inappropriate behavior, and it&#8217;s not going to be tolerated.</p>
<p>And until it&#8217;s also men joining in, women can&#8217;t do this by themselves. There is an organization, A Call to Men, that I&#8217;m a big fan of. And one of their mantras is, if women could have stopped abuse and assault, they would have done it already.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s completely true. It&#8217;s not something that women are going to be able to do alone. It shouldn&#8217;t be looked at as only a women&#8217;s issue. And until people look at this on a larger scale and understand that this affects the bottom line of companies, it affects productivity, it affects, you know, absenteeism, just across the board, this is not a women&#8217;s issue.</p>
<p>It is a human issue.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Right.</p>
<p>Melissa Silverstein, what about that?</p>
<p>And we should point out that men are themselves the victims of sexual harassment and abuse at times.</p>
<p><strong>MELISSA SILVERSTEIN:</strong> I feel that this is on men.</p>
<p>The men are most of the perpetrators. They&#8217;re also the collaborators. And, at The Weinstein Company, their board was all men, and they were all complicit in creating an environment that allowed this to thrive.</p>
<p>In Hollywood, there&#8217;s not a single woman, even the people at the tippy-top of the industry, who don&#8217;t report to men. This is also about getting more women into leadership positions and getting the men &#8212; and holding the men accountable.</p>
<p>The men in this industry need to step up. They need to say, we want to be &#8212; we want to create this industry in a way that women can thrive and don&#8217;t have to experience this anymore.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Leigh Gilmore?</p>
<p><strong>LEIGH GILMORE:</strong> We&#8217;re talking about awareness and accountability.</p>
<p>So, as wonderful as it is to have increased visibility, and it enables us to connect the dots and to see the long histories of sexual abuse, harassment and discrimination, we need new levels of accountability.</p>
<p>I will echo the notion that Harvey Weinstein&#8217;s board certainly knew about these accusations. There&#8217;s a DA who failed to charge him. We have ample examples of failures.</p>
<p>And what we really need to do is to correct those. The role of men is certainly important here. Minimally, they can show up and be witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> And, finally, Fatima Goss Graves, the role of men and how we prevent this.</p>
<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES:</strong> We have had a little bit of conversation about men as survivors, but the conversation we haven&#8217;t really had is about what happens when men are abusers or enablers or allow this to happen in the workplaces, in schools, or in women&#8217;s everyday lives?</p>
<p>And so now we have an opportunity culturally for that conversation. That culture is going to have to hit where policy-makers are. It&#8217;s going to have to hit where employers are in order to make a real difference.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Well, it&#8217;s clear that everyone is hoping this is a watershed moment, that things will change as a result of what&#8217;s happened here. But we will see.</p>
<p>And we appreciate all of you joining us in this conversation, Fatima Goss Graves here with me in Washington, Lisa Senecal, Melissa Silverstein, and Leigh Gilmore.</p>
<p>We thank you all.</p>
<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MELISSA SILVERSTEIN:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>MELISSA SILVERSTEIN,</strong> Founder, Women and Hollywood: Well, I think there was a culture of silence created around this man and also within this industry.</p>
<p>People were afraid. People are afraid for their jobs. It&#8217;s a very relational industry, where if someone is going to blacklist you, you are not going to get your next job.</p>
<p>So I think the way that a person was able to conduct himself for 30 years like this was to build a culture of fear, to make people sign nondisclosure agreements, and to get them to shut up.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Fatima Goss Graves, here with me in Washington with the National Women&#8217;s Law Center, we have been talking about Hollywood.</p>
<p>We have talking about the business workplace. Is there any field of work where this isn&#8217;t going on?</p>
<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES,</strong> President, National Women&#8217;s Law Center: Right.</p>
<p>The issue of harassment and assault, it&#8217;s a Hollywood problem, but really it&#8217;s an everywhere problem. It infects industries across the board, whether you&#8217;re high-wage jobs, low-wage jobs, male-dominated fields, but also female-dominated fields.</p>
<p>Restaurants are some of the areas where you have some of the highest rates of EEOC charges. And that&#8217;s not a male-dominated field.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> EEOC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p>Lisa Senecal, some people are saying that they&#8217;re uncomfortable with this #MeToo campaign movement because they&#8217;re saying, once again, women are being asked to go public with what happened to them, but there is no promise that there is going to be anything done about it. How do you see this?</p>
<p><strong>LISA SENECAL:</strong> I don&#8217;t necessarily believe that women are being asked to come forward.</p>
<p>I think this is an opportunity to come forward, if that&#8217;s something that women want to do, but there&#8217;s no obligation to do it. And there&#8217;s been a lot of support for letting women know that if this isn&#8217;t something you&#8217;re comfortable with at this time, no one is obligated to tell their story, and no one is allowed to force you to tell your story before you&#8217;re ready.</p>
<p>But the stories are important. Without them, the degree to which this happens across all industries, across genders as well &#8212; we know that this happens to men. This happens to the transgender.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not specific to women, although it affects us most frequently. Until we have a critical mass of women who are able to get the men in their lives, the men that they work with to understand how pervasive a problem it is, and then can get men to begin to act on this, because this isn&#8217;t a women&#8217;s issue.</p>
<p>This is a violence issue, and an issue of power and who has the power. So until the people who still primarily do hold the power, which is primarily men and primarily white men, until they&#8217;re going to begin to act, then the problems are going to persist.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Melissa Silverstein, how do you see that? What is it going to take for this to be a change?</p>
<p><strong>MELISSA SILVERSTEIN:</strong> The fact that we&#8217;re having a global conversation about sexual harassment &#8212; I have been doing media for the last week all over the world.</p>
<p>People are really enthralled by this and want to see change. This is a global issue. And, also, Hollywood is a global industry. Seventy cents of every dollar of Hollywood studio movies are made outside the United States.</p>
<p>So what people are looking for is Hollywood to step up. And, today, we had a leader in Hollywood, Kathleen Kennedy, to say we need to have a commission, cross-industry commission, of people who are going to look into this and put a stop to it once and for all.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> And pick up on that, Fatima Goss Graves. Just across the board, what is it going to take?</p>
<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES:</strong> Right.</p>
<p>We know that there are things that would make a difference here. If employers had processes that their employees actually use, you wouldn&#8217;t have harassment in the shadows. Right now, most people don&#8217;t report harassment to anyone. And it&#8217;s because they think their employers won&#8217;t do anything, or, worse, that they would experience retaliation.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> And that&#8217;s &#8212; because that&#8217;s been what happened.</p>
<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES:</strong> And that is. They&#8217;re right to believe that they will experience retaliation, because they do. They&#8217;re shamed. They&#8217;re blamed.</p>
<p>But employees could make a difference. Right? They can be &#8212; take it seriously and communicate that to their workplace. They can also have the right policies that are in place. And, finally, they could, when someone comes forward, be really clear that they take it seriously and that they will not tolerate retaliation.</p>
<p>Those are things that aren&#8217;t happening among employers frequently enough.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Lisa Senecal, as somebody who had it happen to you in a business environment, what changes need to be made in the workplace? What has to happen?</p>
<p><strong>LISA SENECAL:</strong> Well, I agree completely with what was just said.</p>
<p>Too often, the workplace education that goes on is incredibly insufficient. It&#8217;s more of companies wanting to be able to check the box and say that they did their sexual harassment training. And it isn&#8217;t truly something within the culture of companies that they believe that this is a problem and that it is a right of all people working at that company not to be harassed.</p>
<p>So, until it starts to be taken more seriously, and when a woman or anyone comes forward with an accusation, it does have to be taken so much more seriously. And the knee-jerk response, as was in my case, cannot be to shame the woman, can&#8217;t be to blame her for somehow bringing this on herself, and putting women back in a position of being victimized a second time because they&#8217;re not taken seriously when they come forward.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Melissa Silverstein, yes, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>MELISSA SILVERSTEIN:</strong> I just wanted to add, one of the things that&#8217;s so fundamental about this is how this &#8212; how it&#8217;s so normalized for all of us to go through this kind of harassment, especially in Hollywood, and how people kind of laugh off, oh, you know, that&#8217;s locker room talk, or, you know, this is the movie business, get used to it.</p>
<p>And what we need to do is really pierce that veil of the normalization of this kind of conduct, because it starts with, you know, the comments, and then it can escalate very quickly.</p>
<p>So we really need to just change people&#8217;s attitudes and get rid of the toxic masculinity. Hollywood has no much institutionalized sexism that sometimes I feel like we need to just start over, if possible.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Joining us also is Leigh Gilmore, a professor at Wellesley College who&#8217;s written a book about why &#8212; titled &#8220;Why We Doubt What Women Say About Their Lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh Gilmore, why don&#8217;t women &#8212; why haven&#8217;t women been believed and taken seriously on this, and could we now be at a moment when they are?</p>
<p><strong>LEIGH GILMORE,</strong> Wellesley College: It&#8217;s good to be with you, Judy.</p>
<p>I think we have a persistent and a pervasive culture of doubting what women say, especially when they&#8217;re bringing forward accounts of harm into the public sphere. So we have these pre-made default cultural narratives of women&#8217;s unreliability. We have he said/she said, which is a false equivalence narrative.</p>
<p>We have that notion that nobody knows what really happened. We have that notion that you can&#8217;t really trust what women say. None of these are based in fact, but they are part of a kind of cloud that enables us to doubt any woman before she speaks up.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s quite intimidating. And so, if we&#8217;re at a point of change, we really are at a moment where I think we have a new level of visibility, and we have the opportunity to amplify the voices of women who are speaking out.</p>
<p>So, insofar as we have that opportunity, there is a form of solidarity, and more women speaking can lead to change.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Fatima Goss Graves, as somebody who works on these issues from a legal standpoint, are we, could we be at a watershed point, or is it just a whole lot more complicated?</p>
<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES:</strong> Well, the culture change typically has to go together with both the enforcement of the laws and the policy change.</p>
<p>And so we&#8217;re at a tipping point, surely, on culture change. But I will tell you, you know, the National Women&#8217;s Law Center runs a hot line. And over the last two weeks, we have had double the intake on harassment.</p>
<p>And we have a new network called the Legal Network for Gender Equity, so we&#8217;re &#8212; attorneys are joining with us and will be ready to take these cases. But those people who are making these calls and contacting us, I think that that shows that you have people who are ready to come forward on social media, and there is power there, but it seems like there are people who are ready to come forward in other ways, too.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> I want to quickly go around and ask each one of you about the role of men in all of this.</p>
<p>Lisa Senecal?</p>
<p><strong>LISA SENECAL:</strong> Oh, I think it&#8217;s critical for men as allies to be coming forward and supporting women who do come forward.</p>
<p>Men also need to be willing to call out other men, whether that&#8217;s one-on-one, whether it&#8217;s in a group setting within a company, or socially. If a man hears, sees someone doing something inappropriate, they need to have the courage to stand up, even in front of other men, and say, it&#8217;s not OK, it&#8217;s inappropriate behavior, and it&#8217;s not going to be tolerated.</p>
<p>And until it&#8217;s also men joining in, women can&#8217;t do this by themselves. There is an organization, A Call to Men, that I&#8217;m a big fan of. And one of their mantras is, if women could have stopped abuse and assault, they would have done it already.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s completely true. It&#8217;s not something that women are going to be able to do alone. It shouldn&#8217;t be looked at as only a women&#8217;s issue. And until people look at this on a larger scale and understand that this affects the bottom line of companies, it affects productivity, it affects, you know, absenteeism, just across the board, this is not a women&#8217;s issue.</p>
<p>It is a human issue.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Right.</p>
<p>Melissa Silverstein, what about that?</p>
<p>And we should point out that men are themselves the victims of sexual harassment and abuse at times.</p>
<p><strong>MELISSA SILVERSTEIN:</strong> I feel that this is on men.</p>
<p>The men are most of the perpetrators. They&#8217;re also the collaborators. And, at The Weinstein Company, their board was all men, and they were all complicit in creating an environment that allowed this to thrive.</p>
<p>In Hollywood, there&#8217;s not a single woman, even the people at the tippy-top of the industry, who don&#8217;t report to men. This is also about getting more women into leadership positions and getting the men &#8212; and holding the men accountable.</p>
<p>The men in this industry need to step up. They need to say, we want to be &#8212; we want to create this industry in a way that women can thrive and don&#8217;t have to experience this anymore.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Leigh Gilmore?</p>
<p><strong>LEIGH GILMORE:</strong> We&#8217;re talking about awareness and accountability.</p>
<p>So, as wonderful as it is to have increased visibility, and it enables us to connect the dots and to see the long histories of sexual abuse, harassment and discrimination, we need new levels of accountability.</p>
<p>I will echo the notion that Harvey Weinstein&#8217;s board certainly knew about these accusations. There&#8217;s a DA who failed to charge him. We have ample examples of failures.</p>
<p>And what we really need to do is to correct those. The role of men is certainly important here. Minimally, they can show up and be witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> And, finally, Fatima Goss Graves, the role of men and how we prevent this.</p>
<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES:</strong> We have had a little bit of conversation about men as survivors, but the conversation we haven&#8217;t really had is about what happens when men are abusers or enablers or allow this to happen in the workplaces, in schools, or in women&#8217;s everyday lives?</p>
<p>And so now we have an opportunity culturally for that conversation. That culture is going to have to hit where policy-makers are. It&#8217;s going to have to hit where employers are in order to make a real difference.</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF:</strong> Well, it&#8217;s clear that everyone is hoping this is a watershed moment, that things will change as a result of what&#8217;s happened here. But we will see.</p>
<p>And we appreciate all of you joining us in this conversation, Fatima Goss Graves here with me in Washington, Lisa Senecal, Melissa Silverstein, and Leigh Gilmore.</p>
<p>We thank you all.</p>
<p><strong>FATIMA GOSS GRAVES:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MELISSA SILVERSTEIN:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p>A 61-year-old San Antonio man pleaded guilty to two federal charges in the human smuggling incident that led to the deaths of 10 undocumented immigrants this summer.</p>
<p>James Matthew Bradley Jr., who appeared before a U.S. magistrate judge Monday, pleaded guilty to &#8220;one count of conspiracy to transport aliens resulting in death and one count of transporting aliens resulting in death,&#8221; according to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdtx/pr/james-matthew-bradley-jr-pleads-guilty-transporting-undocumented-aliens-resulting-death">statement</a> from the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Western District of Texas.</p>
<p>The office added that Bradley&#8217;s &#8220;admission of guilt&#8221; meant he packed dozens of unauthorized immigrants into a tractor-trailer for financial gain, adding that the suspect confirmed that details from court documents were &#8220;factually correct.&#8221;</p>
<p>On July 23, San Antonio Police Department officers responded to a call from a Walmart employee shortly past midnight. Once officers arrived, they found 39 immigrants at the scene. Of those carried in the tractor-trailer, eight were found dead in the rear of the trailer, while two died later at nearby hospitals, the statement said.</p>
<p>Survivors of the incident said there was <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/death-migrants-texas-shows-dangers-human-smuggling/">no air conditioning in the overheated trailer</a> and had to take turns to breath through a hole in the back of the truck for air. Bradley also initially told investigators that he was unaware of the immigrants in the trailer until he had stopped at the Walmart in San Antonio for bathroom break.</p>
<p>The attorney&#8217;s office also said Bradley faces up to life in prison with the charges and that he is scheduled to be sentenced in January 2018. Immigrants said there were up to 200 people transported on the trailer and that different fees were quoted to them for the ride north from the U.S.-Mexico border, the statement added.</p>
<p>Jason Buch of San Antonio Express-News told the NewsHour earlier this year that Border Patrol agents in Laredo, Texas, reported an uptick of immigrants using tractor-trailers to get pass checkpoints at the border.</p>
<p>“People are usually going on to major metropolitan areas or regions of the country that employ a lot of immigrant laborers, so, areas with large agriculture industries or construction booms,” Buch said.</p>

<p>“This case is a glaring reminder that alien smugglers are driven by greed and have little regard for the health and well-being of their human cargo, which can prove to be a deadly combination,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Bradley&#8217;s co-defendant Pedro Silva Segura was also indicted last month with faces two counts of conspiracy and two counts of transporting undocumented immigrants resulting in serious bodily injury and placing lives in jeopardy.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — For U.S. presidents, meeting the families of military personnel killed in war is about as wrenching as the presidency gets. President Donald Trump&#8217;s suggestion Monday that his predecessors fell short in that duty brought a visceral reaction from those who witnessed those grieving encounters.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a deranged animal,&#8221; Alyssa Mastromonaco, a former deputy chief of staff to President Barack Obama, tweeted about Trump. With an expletive, she called Trump&#8217;s statement in the Rose Garden a lie.</p>
<p>Trump said in a news conference he had written letters to the families of four soldiers killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger and planned to call them, crediting himself with taking extra steps in honoring the dead properly. &#8220;Most of them didn&#8217;t make calls,&#8221; he said of his predecessors. He said it&#8217;s possible that Obama &#8220;did sometimes&#8221; but &#8220;other presidents did not call.&#8221;</p>
<p>The record is plain that presidents reached out to families of the dead and to the wounded, often with their presence as well as by letter and phone. The path to Walter Reed and other military hospitals, as well as to the Dover, Delaware, Air Force Base where the remains of fallen soldiers are often brought, is a familiar one to Obama, George W. Bush and others.</p>
<p>Bush, even at the height of two wars, &#8220;wrote all the families of the fallen,&#8221; said Freddy Ford, spokesman for the ex-president. Ford said Bush also called or met &#8220;hundreds, if not thousands&#8221; of family members of the war dead.</p>

<p>Obama&#8217;s official photographer, Pete Souza, tweeted that he photographed Obama &#8220;meeting with hundreds of wounded soldiers, and family members of those killed in action.&#8221; Others recalled his frequent visits with Gold Star families, and travels to Walter Reed, Dover and other venues with families of the dead and with the wounded.</p>
<p>Retired Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed these contacts, tweeting: &#8220;POTUS 43 &amp; 44 and first ladies cared deeply, worked tirelessly for the serving, the fallen, and their families. Not politics. Sacred Trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump addressed the matter when asked why he had not spoken about the four soldiers killed in Niger. They died when militants thought to be affiliated with the Islamic State group ambushed them while they were patrolling in unarmored trucks with Nigerien troops.</p>
<p>&#8220;I actually wrote letters individually to the soldiers we&#8217;re talking about, and they&#8217;re going to be going out either today or tomorrow,&#8221; he said, meaning he wrote to the families of the fallen soldiers. He did not explain why letters had not been sent yet, more than a week after the attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn&#8217;t make calls,&#8221; Trump said.</p>
<p>Pressed on that statement later, he said of Obama: &#8220;I was told that he didn&#8217;t often, and a lot of presidents don&#8217;t. They write letters.&#8221; He went on: &#8220;President Obama, I think, probably did sometimes, and maybe sometimes he didn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s what I was told. &#8230; Some presidents didn&#8217;t do anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said later that Trump &#8220;wasn&#8217;t criticizing predecessors, but stating a fact.&#8221; She argued that presidents didn&#8217;t always call families of those killed in battle: &#8220;Sometimes they call, sometimes they send a letter, other times they have the opportunity to meet family members in person.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said anyone claiming a former president had called every family was &#8220;mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bush&#8217;s commitment to writing to all military families of the dead and to reaching out by phone or meeting with many others came despite the enormity of the task. In the Iraq war alone, U.S. combat deaths were highest during his presidency, exceeding 800 each year from 2004 through 2007. The number fell to 313 in Bush&#8217;s last year in office as the insurgency faded. Bush once said he felt the appropriate way to show his respect was to meet family members in private.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/bannon-vs-mcconnell-fight-means-trump-gop/"><strong>READ MORE: What the Bannon vs. McConnell fight means for Trump and the GOP</strong></a></p>
<p>Obama declared an end to combat operations in Iraq in August 2010 and the last U.S. troops were withdrawn in December 2011. As Obama wound down that war, he sent tens of thousands more troops into Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010, and the death count mounted. From a total of 155 Americans killed in Afghanistan in 2008, which was Bush&#8217;s last full year in office, the number jumped to 311 in 2009 and peaked the next year at 498. In all, more than 1,700 died in Afghanistan on Obama&#8217;s watch.</p>
<p>Among other rituals honoring military families, the Obamas had a &#8220;Gold Star&#8221; Christmas tree in the White House decorated with hundreds of photos and notes from people who had lost loved ones in war. Gold Star families visited during the holidays, bringing ornaments.</p>
<p>Trump visited Dover early in his presidency, going in February with his daughter Ivanka for the return of the remains of a U.S. Navy SEAL killed during a raid in Yemen, William &#8220;Ryan&#8221; Owens.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s relations with Gold Star families have not always been smooth, dating from his belittlement of the parents of slain U.S. soldier Humayun Khan, who was Muslim. Trump was angered when the soldier&#8217;s father, Khizr Khan, was given a platform to criticize him at the Democratic National Convention.</p>
<p>Owens&#8217; grieving father said he didn&#8217;t want to talk with Trump at Dover. But the sailor&#8217;s widow, Carryn, attended Trump&#8217;s address to Congress and wept as he thanked her.</p>

<p>A grand jury has formally charged a 22-year-old man with capital murder and rape in the death of Nabra Hassanen, who was killed on her walk back to a Virginia mosque.</p>
<p>The Fairfax County Circuit Court indicted Darwin Martinez-Torres of Sterling, Virginia, on Monday on four counts of capital murder for killing Nabra, who was with friends while they had a meal before Ramadan services. Dozens of people had gathered outside the courthouse today, <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMurilloWTOP/status/918910737573171201">chanting &#8220;Justice for Nabra.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Virginia law has specific conditions for pursuing the death penalty, but the Associated Press reported that the grand jury&#8217;s indictment described in graphic detail how Nabra&#8217;s killing was <a href="https://apnews.com/950a9642c9c84840a8a11535ecd5fcbb?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=APSouthRegion">grounds for a death penalty</a> against Martinez-Torres. The indictment appears to acknowledge for the first time that the 17-year-old Muslim teen was raped. Under state law, the combination of a rape charge with a premeditated murder charge means the death penalty can be pursued.</p>
<p>Police have said that Martinez-Torres, who is an undocumented immigrant, got into a confrontation on June 18 with a group of teens walking back to the All Dulles Area Muslim Society after grabbing a late meal. He is accused of returning later and beating Nabra with a baseball bat. Police said Nabra&#8217;s body was later discovered in a pond. A search warrant affidavit revealed that Martinez-Torres admitted to killing Nabra and had led authorities to where he dumped her body, AP reported.</p>
<p>Nabra&#8217;s parents and Muslim advocates have said that Nabra&#8217;s death was motivated by hate, but police has said that they will not treat the killing as a hate crime. Instead, police have said it was a <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/police-say-17-year-old-girl-killed-road-rage-incident-near-mosque/">road rage incident</a>.</p>
<p>“The reason this guy he hit my daughter is because she’s Muslim,” Nabra&#8217;s father Mahmoud Hassanen <a href="http://wamu.org/story/17/10/13/man-accused-murder-nabra-hassanen-heads-court/">told WAMU</a>. “Why [didn’t he] hit the boy who bothered him?”</p>
<p>Nabra&#8217;s father added that he hoped for the death penalty, while her mother said she wanted Martinez-Torres to serve life in prison.</p>
<p>“I just want people to remember her, and don’t forget her,” Mahmoud told WAMU. “I think nobody can forget her too, for what she did in her life.”</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing for Martinez-Torres reportedly <a href="http://www.fox5dc.com/news/local-news/nabra-hassanens-family-has-outburst-in-hearing-after-seeing-accused-killer">turned emotional</a> on Friday, with Nabra&#8217;s parents both shouting at the suspect in court. Nabra&#8217;s mother Sawsan Gazzar apparently threw a shoe at Martinez-Torres during the proceedings.</p>

In all, the fires have consumed more than 220,000 acres, an area larger than New York City.</p>
<p>More than 5,700 structures have been destroyed. And at least 41 people have died, making it the deadliest wildfire in the state&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>The wine industry and the tourism business connected with it are trying to take stock. More than $50 billion in California&#8217;s economy comes from the wine business. And nearly 24 million people visit the region for that reason every year.</p>
<p>Special correspondent Joanne Jennings reports from Napa County.</p>
<p><strong>JOANNE JENNINGS, </strong>Special Correspondent: The Mayacamas mountain range creates a natural barrier between Sonoma and Napa Counties. And it is here where the massive Nuns fire is posing a tough challenge for some 11,000 firefighters who are taming the blaze with aircraft and units on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>CAPT. MARK BRENNERMAN,</strong> Viejas fire Department: We&#8217;re going around and making sure none of these fires that are still smoldering and smoking, we&#8217;re not going to get another big fire out of them.</p>
<p><strong>JOANNE JENNINGS:</strong> Even as firefighters are battling shifting winds, owners and workers in Wine Country are trying to determine just how much damage has been done.</p>
<p>The tony Highlands gated community was among the first to be consumed by flames when the Atlas fire raced through this canyon, leaving several mansions in rubble. Down the hill, at the Silverado resort, charred remnants of the Safeway PGA Tour remain. The major golf event had just wrapped up last Sunday afternoon, a few hours before flames engulfed tents and grandstands, forcing spectators and athletes to evacuate.</p>
<p><strong>MAN:</strong> Do you see how it burned right up to the retaining wall here?</p>
<p><strong>JOANNE JENNINGS:</strong> Silverado resident Steve Messina stayed behind and shot video of fire crews containing the flames, which consumed some condos. Within minutes, flames raced three miles down Silverado Trail, home to several storied hillside vineyards.</p>
<p>Most wineries in the region have been spared the worst. But hundreds suffered some damage. And at least eight vineyards have been significantly damaged or destroyed.</p>
<p>Pierre Birebent, who has been making wines for the family-owned Signorello estate for 20 years, rushed to his winery as quickly as he could.</p>
<p><strong>PIERRE BIREBENT,</strong> Signorello Estate Vineyards: I jumped right in my truck, came down, and then when I was riding down, I saw the hill all flaming.</p>
<p><strong>JOANNE JENNINGS:</strong> Two vineyard workers joined him to help save the estate&#8217;s tasting room.</p>
<p><strong>PIERRE BIREBENT:</strong> But the smoke was getting very thick, and the wind was very strong. And after an hour, we couldn&#8217;t breathe anymore. At the moment, I was so upset. It was rage to see that I couldn&#8217;t do anything. But it was like fighting a giant.</p>
<p><strong>JOANNE JENNINGS:</strong> The tasting room, which also housed the winery&#8217;s office and a dining room, burned to the ground. But Birebent says he wants to focused on what survived.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he said, the fire stopped short of reaching the vineyard, the crush pad, or any of the barrels of wine stored on site; 95 percent of this year&#8217;s grapes were already picked.</p>
<p>But, to be on the safe side, Birebent is taking these samples to a lab to make sure the juice is not too acidic for winemaking. If the crops are OK, a staff of 25 employees will have jobs to return to.</p>
<p>As the fires begin to recede and the smoke clears, people here are beginning to wonder when the tourists, who fuel much of the economy, will return.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a serious concern for Andrew and Jeni (ph) Schluter, who are self-employed and are raising a young family.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW SCHLUTER,</strong> Andrew&#8217;s Tours and Transportation: I do wine tours and transportation for people. And my business started to do really, really well. I was on track to have the best month ever.</p>
<p><strong>JOANNE JENNINGS:</strong> Andrew just bought this new SUV, which has been idle in his driveway collecting ash. Jeni is a personal trainer and has family who lost their homes in the fires. She&#8217;s just not sure how they&#8217;re going to make ends meet.</p>
<p><strong>WOMAN:</strong> I think we&#8217;re just overwhelmed, you know? And uncertainty is kind of scary.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW SCHLUTER:</strong> We will hopefully get by for awhile, but we might make &#8212; have to make some hard decisions shortly.</p>
<p><strong>JOANNE JENNINGS:</strong> While fires burn nearby, some vineyards are already open to tourists. At the Raymond Vineyard, workers are crushing grapes at a feverish pitch. The tasting room is open for the first time since the fires started.</p>
<p>Jeremy and Erika Moore arrived from Tennessee yesterday. They considered canceling their trip, but decided the best way they could help people here is to give them their business.</p>
<p><strong>JEREMY MOORE,</strong> Tourist: On the one hand, a few hundred yards from here, you can see them shuttling up with the helicopters fighting fires, but then here it&#8217;s beautiful. They are doing some great tastings, and they are working outside on the crops. So, it&#8217;s a weird combination of tragedy, but then at the same time business must go on, too.</p>
<p><strong>JOANNE JENNINGS:</strong> Proprietor Jean-Charles Boisset owns several wineries in California, France and Canada, but like many other people here, he and his family had to evacuate their home when the flames came dangerously close.</p>
<p>Still, he is bullish about the future of the wine industry in this region.</p>
<p><strong>JEAN-CHARLES BOISSET,</strong> Boisset Collection: Napa has been one of the most amazing agricultural places in California for a long time, so it will survive those fires. What I love, as a Frenchman here in California, is that amazing American positive attitude.</p>
<p>We will recover. We will walk again, run again, and we will welcome all our guests and give them the dreams of fine wine.</p>

In all, the fires have consumed more than 220,000 acres, an area larger than New York City.</p>
<p>More than 5,700 structures have been destroyed. And at least 41 people have died, making it the deadliest wildfire in the state&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>The wine industry and the tourism business connected with it are trying to take stock. More than $50 billion in California&#8217;s economy comes from the wine business. And nearly 24 million people visit the region for that reason every year.</p>
<p>Special correspondent Joanne Jennings reports from Napa County.</p>
<p><strong>JOANNE JENNINGS, </strong>Special Correspondent: The Mayacamas mountain range creates a natural barrier between Sonoma and Napa Counties. And it is here where the massive Nuns fire is posing a tough challenge for some 11,000 firefighters who are taming the blaze with aircraft and units on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>CAPT. MARK BRENNERMAN,</strong> Viejas fire Department: We&#8217;re going around and making sure none of these fires that are still smoldering and smoking, we&#8217;re not going to get another big fire out of them.</p>
<p><strong>JOANNE JENNINGS:</strong> Even as firefighters are battling shifting winds, owners and workers in Wine Country are trying to determine just how much damage has been done.</p>
<p>The tony Highlands gated community was among the first to be consumed by flames when the Atlas fire raced through this canyon, leaving several mansions in rubble. Down the hill, at the Silverado resort, charred remnants of the Safeway PGA Tour remain. The major golf event had just wrapped up last Sunday afternoon, a few hours before flames engulfed tents and grandstands, forcing spectators and athletes to evacuate.</p>
<p><strong>MAN:</strong> Do you see how it burned right up to the retaining wall here?</p>
<p><strong>JOANNE JENNINGS:</strong> Silverado resident Steve Messina stayed behind and shot video of fire crews containing the flames, which consumed some condos. Within minutes, flames raced three miles down Silverado Trail, home to several storied hillside vineyards.</p>
<p>Most wineries in the region have been spared the worst. But hundreds suffered some damage. And at least eight vineyards have been significantly damaged or destroyed.</p>
<p>Pierre Birebent, who has been making wines for the family-owned Signorello estate for 20 years, rushed to his winery as quickly as he could.</p>
<p><strong>PIERRE BIREBENT,</strong> Signorello Estate Vineyards: I jumped right in my truck, came down, and then when I was riding down, I saw the hill all flaming.</p>
<p><strong>JOANNE JENNINGS:</strong> Two vineyard workers joined him to help save the estate&#8217;s tasting room.</p>
