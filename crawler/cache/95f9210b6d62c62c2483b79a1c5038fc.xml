<p>While many are out <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ipad-air-2024-preorder" target="_self">preordering</a> the brand-new iPad Air this week, the previous generation is on sale at Amazon for a significantly reduced price. </p><p>As of today, you can shop the <a href="https://zdcs.link/joM1p?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20Air%20%285th%20generation%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00eXK6PmCiL62mAtaLPZBX3&short_url=joM1p&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple iPad Air (5th generation)</a> for $599 at Amazon.

This price marks the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B09V3JDWSL" target="_blank">lowest drop </a>we've seen for the iPad Air at Amazon. However, a few weeks ago, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/april-29-ipad-air-deal" target="_self">Best Buy beat this price</a>, listing the model for $399.99. </p><p>While the ultra-thin and light design is certainly a plus when it comes to the iPad Air, what really makes this iPad special is that it has an Apple M1 Chip &mdash; the very same chip that's used to power Apple Macbooks.

I couldn&rsquo;t have been more wrong about the &ldquo;swan-song&rdquo; part, though, because I&rsquo;ve been using a Pixel 8a for the past several days.</p><p>That&rsquo;s fine, though, because Google&rsquo;s track record of making really good $500 Android handsets has remained consistent over the years, and is unchanged in 2024. While I&rsquo;m not totally enamored with every &ldquo;new&rdquo; feature packed into the Pixel 8a (enough with the AI stuff), its remarkable parity with <a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro" target="_self"><u>a phone that was $200 more</u></a> back in October makes Pixel 8a a compelling option for anyone who&rsquo;s overdue for an affordable Android upgrade.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>What I like about the Google Pixel 8a</h2><p>It&rsquo;s important to note up-front that much of what makes the Pixel 8a good also made the Pixel 8 a quality handset late last year. Its design and specs are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-8a-vs-pixel-8" target="_self"><u>nearly identical</u></a> in all the ways that matter, but again, you&rsquo;re paying $200 less for this one, so that&rsquo;s cool.</p><h3>Google didn&rsquo;t fix what wasn't broken</h3><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">

        </div>
    </div>
<p>When I say the design and specs are similar, I mean it.&nbsp;</p><p>Pixel 8a looks like the spitting image of Pixel 8, with Google&rsquo;s now-distinctive horizontal camera bar situated in the upper portion of the phone&rsquo;s backside. Its corners are rounded and its back has a matte finish in one of the four following colorways: Aloe, Bay, Obsidian, and Porcelain.&nbsp;</p><p>Our review unit came in the cool blue Bay color and I personally adore it. The other colors are <em>fine</em>, I guess, but Bay is definitely the way to go this year.</p><p>Here are the basic specs of the review unit Google provided us:</p><ul><li><p>6.1-inch Actua display with 2400x1080 resolution and up to 120Hz adaptive refresh rate</p></li><li><p>Google Tensor G3 chipset</p></li><li><p>128GB of storage</p></li><li><p>8GB of RAM</p></li></ul><p>You can also upgrade to 256GB of storage this year, which bolts an extra $60 onto the Pixel 8a&rsquo;s $500 starting price tag.</p><p>Those specs are all right in line with the Pixel 8, with the exception of display size, which is a tenth of an inch smaller than the 6-2-inch glass present on last year&rsquo;s entry-level Pixel. Despite that, Pixel 8a is actually a tenth of an inch <em>taller</em> than Pixel 8 and two-tenths of an ounce heavier, to boot.&nbsp;</p><p>Look, these aren&rsquo;t big differences, but they <em>are</em> differences, and they need to be noted, folks.</p><h3>Almost everything you want is here</h3><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Point being, this is <em>basically</em> a Pixel 8 with a few small cuts around the edges that barely impact the everyday experience at all. That means all of the AI features that made their debut in Pixel 8 are here, and how you feel about that depends on how you felt about them last year.</p><p>The Pixel 8 experience has been pretty faithfully recreated in a cheaper phone. You can use Circle to Search to draw a little circle around anything on the screen and have Google&rsquo;s AI bring up a relevant web search for you. You can also use the AI call screening feature to have conversations with service workers without actually talking to them.</p><p>That means AI camera features like Magic Editor and Audio Magic Eraser also make their return in Pixel 8a. Best Take allows you to composite together a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; group photo based on several tries, and Magic Eraser is back to remove photobombers from your vacation pictures.</p><p>I have&hellip;feelings about some of these features that I&rsquo;ll get to in a bit, but it&rsquo;s at the very least commendable that Google included so much of the Pixel 8 in the comparatively more affordable Pixel 8a.</p><h3>Flagship-level performance</h3><p>That goes for performance, too.</p><p>There isn&rsquo;t a ton to say about it, honestly. Pixel 8a uses the same Tensor G3 chip as Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, and my experience from an everyday performance standpoint has been pretty much the same as it was on those phones. It doesn&rsquo;t ever hitch even when several apps are open, everything is smooth as can be, and I haven&rsquo;t found heating to be a problem.</p><p>The 120Hz refresh rate doesn&rsquo;t hurt, either. It just makes everything feel more responsive and quick. Points to Google for getting it into the Pixel 8a this year after the 7a could only go up to 90Hz. For reference, the base <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-15-plus-review" target="_self"><u>iPhone 15</u></a> is still stuck at 60Hz.</p><h2>What I dislike about the Google Pixel 8a</h2><p>There&rsquo;s nothing functionally wrong with Pixel 8a that I can discern. My main concern is philosophical.</p><h3>It&rsquo;s time for some new ideas</h3><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Basically, the Pixel 8a suffers from being an iteration of the Pixel 8, which wasn&rsquo;t the most exciting Pixel in years. At least, not for me.</p><p>I just don&rsquo;t think most of these AI features are all that useful or would even be desirable if they were useful. I&rsquo;ve seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnJVvzyazqg" target="_blank"><u>the TV commercial</u></a> where a woman edits a photo so it looks like her husband is throwing a baby dangerously high in the air hundreds of times during basketball games and I still don&rsquo;t understand who exactly Magic Editor is for.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, I guess features like that and Best Take are for people who want to strip their social media presences of all imperfection and genuine humanity, but that&rsquo;s not me.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, the things that separate the Pixel 8a from the Pixel 7a (aside from the boosted refresh rate and new chip) aren&rsquo;t all that enticing. This is a very good phone for the price, but the need to upgrade to Pixel 8a is not especially urgent if you bought a Pixel in the last two or three years.</p><h2>What&rsquo;s &lsquo;meh&rsquo; about the Google Pixel 8a</h2><p>Somewhere along the line, Google has to make cuts to justify dropping the price of the 8a to $500. This year, the only difference that really bothers me is one little cut camera trick.</p><h3>One missing camera feature</h3><p>Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro both had a Macro Focus feature that allowed you to position the camera way up close against objects with small, fine details and get snazzy looking shots.&nbsp;</p><p>[Insert macro shot here]</p><p>As you may have guessed by now, Pixel 8a can&rsquo;t do that. Bummer! That said, the camera is still pretty good for what you pay for.</p><h2>Google Pixel 8a camera</h2><p>I&rsquo;m going to keep this section relatively brief because Google didn&rsquo;t do much to the Pixel 8a&rsquo;s cameras compared to the Pixel 7a. In fact, specs-wise, Google didn&rsquo;t do anything at all. Both Pixel 7a and Pixel 8a share the exact same physical camera specs:</p><ul><li><p>64MP wide rear lens</p></li><li><p>13MP ultra-wide rear lens</p></li><li><p>13MP front lens</p></li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing because this isn&rsquo;t a flagship phone. The Pixel 8a&rsquo;s cameras combined with Google&rsquo;s computational photo software can still create nice-looking shots, even when New York City conspires to be gloomy and grey outside for an entire weekend:</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>This is a perfectly fine camera array for a $500 phone. Hopefully Google finds some more interesting improvements for Pixel 9a that don&rsquo;t involve AI.</p><h2>Google Pixel 8a battery life</h2><p>Another very marginal cut from Pixel 8 came in the form of battery size. Last year&rsquo;s baseline Pixel had a 4,575mAh battery, while the Pixel 8a has a reduced 4,492mAh engine powering itself.&nbsp;</p><p>As tends to be the case with recent Pixel phones (at least in my experience) though, that doesn&rsquo;t really matter. I was able to go about 24 hours between charges while using the phone regularly for video streaming, web browsing, and social media. That&rsquo;s right in line with both the Pixel 8 and Pixel 7a in my testing. It&rsquo;s also more than good enough for me.</p><h2>Google Pixel 8a final thoughts</h2><p>Whether or not you should buy the Pixel 8a really depends on where you&rsquo;re at in your personal phone upgrade journey.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re on an older Android device and desperately need something affordable that will get years of software upgrades and general reliability, the Pixel 8a is a great choice. Its elite performance coupled with a flagship-esque display and decent enough camera specs are more than enough to make up for some lackluster returning AI features.</p><p>But if you have a more recent Pixel (even an A-series from the last year or two), I would recommend waiting until the Pixel 9 announcement later this year. Pixel 8a is an appealing option for those in need of an urgent upgrade, but it doesn&rsquo;t create any urgency by itself.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Now, first things first. The process of pairing your AirPods (<a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-2-review" target="_self">2nd</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-3-review" target="_self">3rd generation</a>) or AirPods Pro (<a href="https://mashable.com/review/airpods-pro-review" target="_self">1st</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-pro-2-review" target="_self">2nd generation</a>) via <a href="https://mashable.com/category/bluetooth" target="_self">Bluetooth</a> might look different depending on what type of computer you use. Let's go with a <a href="https://mashable.com/category/macbook" target="_self">Mac</a> first. </p><h2>How to connect AirPods to a Mac</h2><p>First you want to make sure that your Mac's operating system is up to date. To do that, click on the Apple icon in the upper left hand corner of your desktop screen and click on "About this Mac." A screen will pop up, and there you can click on "Software Update." </p><p>It's always best to update to the latest, which is <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/108382" target="_blank">macOS Sonoma 14.4.1</a>. According to Apple, 2nd generation AirPods require macOS Mojave 10.14.4 or later (3rd generation needs macOS Monterey or later), and AirPods Pro require Catalina 10.15.1 or later (2nd generation needs the latest, Sonoma).</p><p>Now that you've made sure your Mac is up to date, follow these simple steps to connect your AirPods. </p><div class="mx-auto max-w-3xl">

                        In order to download movies and TV shows from the Netflix app, you'll first need the latest version of the app. You can get it on your iPhone or iPad running iOS 16 or later, on your Android phone or tablet running Android 5.0 or later, on your Amazon Fire tablet running Fire OS 5.0 or later, on your Windows 10 or 11 tablet or computer (only on ad-free Netflix plans), and on Chromebook through Google Play Store. Make sure you keep the app updated for it to work the best. To see if your app needs to be updated, navigate to your App Store and tap updates.

To find a movie or TV show that <em>is</em> downloadable, tap on your choice and look for the Downloads icon &mdash; a downward-facing arrow located near the play button. On a Windows 10 device, you'll need to open the Netflix app and select Menu, then navigate to See What You Can Download, Find Something to Download, Find More to Download, or Available for Download, depending on your device. You can also filter for shows by what is available for download.

<p>But before we get there, what happened again last season and where did everyone end up? We've done a quick rundown of everything you need to remember from Season 2 of <em>Bridgerton</em> before you watch Season 3, from the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bridgerton-season-2-near-kisses-ranked" target="_self">enemies-to-lovers tale of the Viscount and Viscountess</a> to the worst friendship fallout in the Ton, all of which culminated in the gilded Featherington Ball.</p><h2>Penelope and Eloise's friendship sits in ruins</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>At the end of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bridgerton-season-2-primer" target="_self">Season 1</a>, Penelope Featherington was revealed as the secret identity of the Ton's prolific scandal sheet publisher, Lady Whistledown (voiced by Julie Andrews). But while we're allowed in on it as viewers, there's only a few people within the series who know, and by the end of Season 2, unfortunately one is now her best friend Eloise Bridgerton (Claudia Jessie). </p><p>Eloise has been hunting Lady Whistledown's identity for two seasons, but in Season 2 her enthusiasm made her a target of Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel) as her number one suspect. If you remember, the Queen despises the author's influence and recruited Eloise to find out who they really were in Season 1. In Season 2, Eloise followed the trail to the printing shop used by Whistledown, where she met young printer and covert women's rights campaigner Theo Sharpe (Calam Lynch), and their romance blossomed. Unfortunately for Eloise, her visits (along with her outspokenness on society) drew the Queen's suspicions. Eloise swore her innocence to the monarch, but it was no use, as the Queen threatened Eloise and her family with social ruin unless she confessed to being Lady Whistledown.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>With Eloise about to falsely confess with a counterfeit society paper, Penelope took matters into her own hands, writing a scathing blast about her best friend's visits with Theo &mdash; "unchaperoned, with improper company, political radicals in fact" &mdash; to disprove Eloise's guilt. The pamphlet diverted the Queen's wrath but socially ruined Eloise. Suffice to say her romance with Theo crumbled too.</p><p>Following this, Penelope rested her pen after being "done ruining the lives of others" through gossip. However, in the Season 2 finale, Eloise figured out her friend's secret identity when Penelope flexed her keen powers of observation at the Featherington Ball.&nbsp;While Pen danced with Colin, Eloise stole into her friend's room and discovered her secret stash of money hidden beneath the floorboards (the profits made from her publications) and confronted Penelope, running through the juicy details only Pen would have known about.&nbsp;It's a horrible fight, with Eloise feeling deeply betrayed, and the two parted on non-speaking terms.</p><p>However, Penelope's fight with Eloise did not obliterate her penchant for writing, as we saw her return to her writing desk at the end of Season 2.</p><h2>Colin scorned Penelope romantically in public</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>It's one of the biggest moments in <em>Bridgerton</em> Season 2 that will be important for Season 3, and honestly, we're still reeling from it. Penelope has long yearned for the affections of her friend Colin, though has remained firmly in the Regency friend zone &mdash; including through Colin's engagement to Marina Thompson (Ruby Barker) in Season 1. But things seemed slightly flirty in Season 2. </p><p>Channelling big "I've just returned from my gap year" energy after returning from Greece, Colin strolled around Season 2 with suddenly mature pep in his step. Though he danced often with Cressida Cowper (Jessica Madsen), he sent Penelope mixed signals, praising her "constant and loyal" personality throughout the season. Penelope's hopes were high at the Featherington Ball, and when Colin asked Pen to dance, he dropped some big words: "I will always look after you, Penelope. You are special to me."&nbsp;</p><p>However, after her fight with Eloise, Penelope stumbled upon Colin speaking about his dance to a group of young men on the terrace. When they questioned him on his intentions with Pen, he scoffed, "Are you mad? I would never dream of courting Penelope Featherington. Not in your wildest dreams."</p><p>NO! NOOOOO. NO. We were all crushed right there with Pen in this scene, and this is where Season 3 will pick up. Perhaps, if there's forgiveness elsewhere on the horizon, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bridgerton-peneloise-gay" target="_self">we can still hope for a Peneloise romance?</a></p><h2>Kate and Anthony are happily married</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>After the steamy <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bridgerton-season-2-near-kisses-ranked" target="_self">enemies-to-lovers romance between Kate Sharma (Simone Ashley) and Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey)</a>, the pair were finally married&nbsp;at the end of Season 2. Remember the Viscount was engaged to Kate's sister, Edwina (Charithra Chandran), but she absconded from the altar the minute she realised her sister and Anthony were very obviously in love. This pissed off Queen Charlotte for a moment, as she does not like to be wrong about things, and she'd chosen Edwina as her "diamond" of the season. </p><p>The Bridgertons and Sharmas were publicly ruined by the scandal, but not for long &mdash; and MVP Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh) never abandoned them, despite being socially ostracised by association.</p><p>At the end of the season, after Anthony and Kate had sex in the garden, Kate galloped off into a storm, fell off her horse, and was badly injured. Anthony was riddled with guilt. However, his mother Viola, Dowager Viscountess Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell), helped him embrace his true feelings, speaking to their shared unprocessed grief over Lord Bridgerton's sudden death years earlier. Anthony proposed at Kate's bedside, a move she assumed was a "misguided obligation of duty". Deciding to return to India, she sent him away.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>While the Bridgertons and the Sharmas spent much of the end of Season 2 in social ruin, the Featheringtons had clawed their way back from financial destitution after Lord Featherington's gambling debts saw him murdered in Season 1. Their troubles seemed solved with the arrival of the family's smarmy cousin Jack (Rupert Young), whose engagement to Prudence Featherington (Bessie Carter) proved one of the ickier pairings in the Ton. The season crescendoed with the family's opulent Featherington Ball, a grand show of stability and wealth. With the Queen herself in attendance, the Featheringtons were back in the game.</p><p>In the season finale, however, at the Featherington Ball, Colin Bridgerton exposed Jack as a charlatan selling fake glass jewels as gemstones. Having previously been interested in investing in the gems, Colin demonstrated the scam by smashing Cressida's "ruby" necklace into smithereens in front of Penelope, Lady Featherington (Polly Walker), and Jack himself. Out of respect for the Featheringtons, Colin did this dramatic expos&eacute; in private, telling Jack to return the money he'd spent on this crooked scheme and to leave town &mdash; a move that made Pen fall even harder for her crush. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Jack tried to convince Lady Featherington to leave town with him for America, suggesting a romantic future for the two of them despite his engagement to her daughter (the two had kind of been in cahoots the whole season). But if there's one thing you shouldn't come between, it's Portia and her daughters. Lady Featherington sent Jack packing without a penny and the forged signature promise that once one of her daughters has a son the Featherington estate will transfer to him.

<p>What of Will Mondrich (Martins Imhangbe), the best mate of the Duke of Hastings (Reg&eacute;-Jean Page)? In Season 2, Jack Featherington had also blackmailed his way into holding court in Will's new bar, after convincing <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bridgerton-boxing-scenes-unrealistic" target="_self">the boxer to throw a match</a> to split the winnings &mdash; Will wanted to provide for his wife Alice (Emma Naomi) and their children. Will had opened a gentlemen's club that aimed to be a more inclusive alternative to the posh White's club (IRL it's the oldest gentlemen's club in London, founded in 1693). But business was slow and he was indebted to Jack, who wielded it over him.</p><p>When Colin got wrapped up in Jack's dealings, taking a meeting at the bar, Mondrich tried to warn him of Jack's shady side, but Colin defended him as the head of the Featheringtons. So, at the end of the season, after Jack's corruption was exposed, Colin ate humble pie with Mondrich and brought all his mates back to his bar, apologising. But as you've already read, it's not all Colin needs to apologise for.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/x3Bej?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bridgerton%20Seasons%201%20and%202%20are%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=04npFcSYH7l1lIuzTRS733Y&short_url=x3Bej&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Bridgerton</em> Seasons 1 and 2 are now streaming on Netflix.</a> Season 3 will drop in two halves, with Part 1 streaming on May 16 and Part 2 on June 13.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Besides, there are simply too many headphones on the market (our testing pool only gets bigger day by day) for you to pay hundreds only to get subpar ANC. If you're spending some cash on noise-cancelling headphones, you should feel more than happy with your investment.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>To help you pick the right set, Mashable editors and reviewers tested dozens of headphones and earbuds and picked out the best noise-cancelling headphones of 2024 (so far).</p><h2>Do noise-cancelling headphones actually work?</h2><p>There's a big difference between outside noise being blocked and music simply being loud enough to drown it out. There's also a difference between true active noise cancellation and hissing or white noise that some headphones rely on to "block out" sound. </p><p>Active noise-cancelling headphones electronically cover up the sounds coming from your surroundings by using internal microphones that listen to what's happening in the world around you, then invert the noise and send it to the speakers. The idea is that both the output and the input will cancel out, leaving you with near-silence. Over-ear headphones can also create a tight seal around your ears that adds another layer of sound blocking.</p><p>If you've tried a pair of noise-cancelling headphones before and haven't been impressed, don't be discouraged. It <em>is</em> possible to get headphones that quiet the hum of people talking around you, or noises from the street that invade your home office. While we haven't found the headphones yet that completely silent the world around you, we've found ones that have gotten pretty dang close.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In the past, not many <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_self">earbuds</a> featured active noise cancellation that was comparable to over-ear headphones, but newer iterations like the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-pro-2-review" target="_self">AirPods Pro </a>and Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds hold their own in the ANC space. However, even these <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-earbuds" target="_self">earbuds</a> can't quite get the same seal that headphones can, so if you're looking for maximum silence, you might be happier with over-ear headphones. However, if you want to cut down on the bulk, earbuds make for great alternatives.</p><h2>What are the best noise-cancelling headphones to buy?</h2><p>Bose and Sony are both top names when it comes to any type of audio, but especially when it comes to noise cancellation. Both brands feature industry-leading ANC on top of superb sound quality. There are also some other brands and models worth checking out, so if you want to tune out ambient sound, we've laid everything out for you below.</p><hr><h2><strong>Best for adjustable ANC: Bose 700</strong></h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-noise-cancelling-700-headphones-review" target="_self"><em>Read our full review of the Bose 700 headphones</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3><strong>Who it's for: </strong></h3><p>For some people, active noise cancellation might be too intense. Sometimes, you need a little ambient noise. Maybe you're not a fan of this lack of awareness, or maybe it actually causes physical discomfort. That doesn't mean you have to forego ANC altogether &mdash; the Bose 700 headphones offer 10 different levels of active noise cancellation (as well as a transparent mode), so you can adjust based on what feels right for you.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this:</strong></h3><p>One of the biggest cons of the Bose 700s is the cost, as Mashable tech reporter Alex Perry noted in his review. However, these headphones came out in 2019, and they're being phased out in place of Bose's new QuietComfort Ultra (another pick on this list). That means while they're still around, you can get top-notch adjustable ANC for $379, and often for less &mdash; they were on sale for a flat $300 following <a href="https://mashable.com/article/black-friday-headphone-and-speaker-deals-2023" target="_self">Black Friday</a> and have dropped even further  in 2024.</p><p>They won't be as comfortable for all-day wear as Bose's QuietComfort headphones, but if the best ANC is your priority above all else, these headphones are likely worth the trade off for you. If you are interested in buying them, you'll want to act sooner rather than later. Already, we've seen them sell out at <a href="https://zdcs.link/dPGd5?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon&object_type=article&object_uuid=07qwHqOat5afxyAFD9nTPsN&short_url=dPGd5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, and once at <a href="https://zdcs.link/BZL1b?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Best%20Buy&object_type=article&object_uuid=07qwHqOat5afxyAFD9nTPsN&short_url=BZL1b&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Best Buy</a> (though they appear to be back in stock and on clearance at the time of writing).

<h3><strong>Who it's for: </strong></h3><p>Over-ear headphones can be great for blocking out noise, but less great for comfort. If you're someone who wants to wear your headphones all day, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bose-quiet-comfort-ultra-headphones-earbuds-preorder" target="_self">Bose QuietComfort line</a> was made for you. We've previously tested the QuietComfort 35 IIs and the QuietComfort 45s, and the QuietComfort Ultra was easily the most comfortable of the three. They're also the most expensive at $429, so be ready to pay for that comfort.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this:</strong></h3><p>The Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones up the ante on the long-popular line from the brand, giving you all day wear with spatial audio. They're also supremely comfortable.</p><p>We wore these headphones for hours &mdash; on flights, with glasses on, all day &mdash; and they wore through it all without squeezing or feeling heavy. Even more importantly, they sound incredible, complete with <a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds" target="_self">Bose's new immersive spatial audio</a>, which gives you a concert-like experience when listening to music, all the while blocking out the world around you.</p><p>We occasionally need to turn the headphones on a couple times for them to connect, but their multipoint pairing works better than past QuietComfort headphones (with the QC 45s, we needed to disconnect one of the two connected devices from the app to avoid annoying skips in the audio). We were also surprised that these headphones don't support passive playback, especially for their price point (which is still $100 less than the Apple AirPods Max at full price).</p><p>Still, if you're willing to live with those minor annoyances, you will be rewarded with excellent ANC on the most comfortable noise-cancelling headphones we've tested yet.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> 24 hours | <strong>App-connected:</strong></em><em> Yes | <strong>Colors: </strong></em><em>Black, sandstone, white</em></p><hr><h2><strong>Best for audiophiles: Sony WH-1000XM5</strong></h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

Whether you really like to blast your music, or just want to hear the lows, highs, and mids of a song, the WH-1000XM5s are the headphones on our list most likely to deliver.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this:</strong></h3><p>Sony's flagship noise-cancelling headphones produce a balanced sound that let your music shine, while giving you enough ANC to block ambient noise.</p><p>Here's what Mashable Deputy Reviews Editor Miller Kern had to say about listening to Brandi Carlile&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOpWqWK0q4U" target="_blank"><u>Right on Time</u></a>&rdquo; on the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/sony-wh-1000xm5-headphones" target="_self">XM5 headphones</a>: "The vocals and instruments all got to shine, and the headphones made it feel like I was there in the studio. These are probably the best-sounding headphones I&rsquo;ve ever tried." That audio quality, combined with their comfort and effective noise cancelling, are what earned them a <a href="https://mashable.com/mashable-choice" target="_self">Mashable Choice Award</a>.</p><p>Their portability factor could be a little better &mdash; the ear cups don't fold in &mdash; but chances are, you'll want to be listening to them most of the time, anyway. When you are on the go, the microphone is another standout feature. Kern relayed that even on a walk home in New York City, she could hear who she was calling perfectly, and be heard herself without any background noise getting in the way. As an added bonus, they have a battery life that beats the Bose QC Ultras by a good six hours.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> 30 hours | <strong>App-connected:</strong></em><em> Yes | <strong>Colors: </strong></em><em>Black, navy, silver</em></p><hr><h2><strong>Best for bass lovers: Sony ULT Wear </strong></h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/sony-ult-wear-headphones" target="_self"><em>Check out our full review of the Sony ULT Wear headphones.</em></a></p><h3><strong>Who it's for:</strong></h3><p>If you don't need a fancy custom equalizer to know you like punching up the bass ten out of ten times, the new Sony ULT Wear headphones are made for you. Our reviewer praised these headphones for offering balanced sound <em>and </em>powerful bass, a rare combo. These are also a great pick for those looking for a slightly cheaper alternative to the WH-1000XM5s.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>Sony just <a href="https://mashable.com/review/sony-ult-field-1-speaker" target="_self">released the new ULT line</a> in April, and considering the price, they're some of the best Sony headphones ever made. They're designed for anyone who's a fan of bass. In addition to the equalizer in the app, the headphones have a dedicated ULT button that lets you bump up the bass on demand. The 40-millimeter driver keeps it sounding clear and not crispy, making these headphones a worthy competitor to the WH-1000XM5s, our top pick for the best sounding noise-cancelling headphones.</p><p>When testing the two headphones side by side, Mashable's Miller Kern found that while both headphones sounded great, "the ULT Wear&rsquo;s sound was fuller and felt more like surround sound. And even on the standard setting, the bass sounded richer on the ULTs." We still stand by the WH-1000XM5s as a better pick for audiophiles, but Kern makes a strong case for buying these over the XM5s. "[To] the average person, I&rsquo;d say the ULT Wears are the winners &mdash; especially for those who prioritize bass and fullness in their audio." </p><p>For $100 cheaper, these are a more than fair alternative to Sony's flagship headphones. </p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> 30 hours | <strong>App-connected:</strong></em><em> Yes | <strong>Colors: </strong></em><em>Black, off-white</em></p><hr><h2><strong>Best noise-cancelling earbuds for Apple users: Apple AirPods Pro</strong></h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-review" target="_self"><em>Read our full review of the Apple AirPods Pro (Generation 2)</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3><strong>Who it's for: </strong></h3><p>If you want ANC without all the bulk, the AirPods Pro are small, discreet, and (thanks to the their long-awaited USB-C charging port) easier to charge. Though headphones typically provide superior ANC, these AirPods have impressive noise cancellation for a pair of buds. You'll probably enjoy them a little extra if you have other devices within the Apple ecosystem. </p><h3><strong>Why we picked this:</strong></h3><p>Are they pricey? Absolutely. Is their ANC worth it? Here's what Mashable Senior Editor <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-pro-2-review" target="_self">Stan Schroeder</a> had to say: "These are the first pair of earbuds I'd actually consider taking on an airplane (instead of my much larger and clunkier over-ear headphones)." Though these aren't the only Apple headphones with ANC, we highly prefer these over the AirPods Max, which we think are way overpriced (they're double the cost of these Pros) and don't have the performance to justify that price tag.</p><p>Other than that killer ANC, AirPods are great for travel because they take up minimal space in your carry on, they sound great, and they have a Conversation Awareness mode which automatically lowers the volume when you're talking, so placing a drink order is easy as can be. And with their new USB-C port, you can charge them directly from an iPhone 15. </p><p>To get a perfectly snug fit to maximize your listening experience, you'll have your choice between four ear tips. Apple claims these buds support lossless audio, but as of right now, only with the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-vision-pro-teardown" target="_self">Apple Vision Pro</a>, so you'd have to shell out an additional $3,500 for that experience.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> 6 hours (up to 30 hours with charging case) </em>| <strong><em>App-connected:</em></strong><em> No | <strong>Colors:</strong></em><em> White</em></p><hr><h2><strong>Best sounding earbuds: Sony WF-1000XM5</strong></h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3><strong>Who it's for:</strong></h3><p>Love high-quality audio but not so fond of the feeling of headphones over your ears? These Sony earbuds have got you covered on both fronts, all the while providing some pretty impressive active noise cancellation.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this:</strong></h3><p>These earbuds deliver a rich, well-balanced sound profile, without the weight of over-ear headphones. The ear tips material are not the usual silicone found on AirPods and other earbuds, but a more foam-like material you'd find on an ear plug, allowing for all-day wear that creates a firm seal without sacrificing comfort. </p><p>The Sony companion app allows for a ton of customization, including touch controls, paired devices, and of course, an equalizer. Those who feel a bit intimated by a completely custom equalizer will appreciate the "Find Your Equalizer" feature, which gives you two rounds of options to select from while listening to music to narrow down what settings actually sound the best. Once you've made your selection, a final before and after sound test confirms you're happy with the mix, making it easier than ever to get the most out of your music.</p><p>We also enjoyed the Adaptive Sound Control, which switches the earbuds automatically from noise cancelling to ambient sound transparency modes based on whether you're sitting or walking around (settings that can be adjusted). Multipoint pairing also lets you switch between two devices with next to zero lag. If you hate using transparency mode because of how it amplifies outside sounds, you can adjust that, too. Admittedly, these earbuds are pricey, but we think the premium features and quality sound justifies the cost for someone who wants a lot out of their earbuds.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> 7-8 hours per charge (24 hours with case)</em> | <strong><em>App-connected:</em></strong><em> Yes | <strong>Colors:</strong></em><em> Black, silver</em></p><hr><h2><strong>Best mid-range earbuds: Beats Studio Buds+</strong></h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3><strong>Who it's for: </strong></h3><p>We don't think these earbuds perform quite as well as the newest AirPods Pro, but they also cost $80 less. If you're trying to get quality ANC earbuds for under $200 (but are willing to spend more than $50), then the Beats Studio Buds+ are the way to go. Plus, with Google Fast Pair support, they're better suited for Android users than the AirPods Pro.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this:</strong></h3><p>We love a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dupes" target="_self">good dupe</a>, what can we say? While these Beats aren't a one-to-one match for the AirPods Pro, they give a lot of the same basic functionality at a much more affordable price. And at six hours per charge with ANC, they match the Pro's battery life exactly. </p><p>As for how they sound, these are Beats headphones, so expect the bass to come through nice and clear. They're not too bass heavy though, and they give plenty of balance on higher frequencies. Their ANC definitely isn't at the same level as the Pros, so having a well-rounded sound is nice, as playing music in tandem with ANC will give you your best shot at blocking out the world around you.</p><p>You'll have your choice between four colorways, including black, silver, ivory, and transparent. During our testing, we also found these earbuds fit more comfortably than the AirPods Pro, so if you tend to have trouble getting AirPods to stay in your ears, these are a better option for you. If you can, we recommend waiting for these earbuds to go on sale &mdash; you can often find them for $149.95 or $129.95.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> 6 hours with ANC, 9 without (27 hours hours with charging case) </em>| <strong><em>App-connected:</em></strong><em> No | <strong>Colors: </strong></em><em>Black, silver, white, transparent, pink</em></p><hr><h2><strong>Best budget earbuds: Anker Soundcore Life P3i</strong></h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3><strong>Who it's for:</strong></h3><p>If you're on a tight budget but still want to enjoy noise cancelling, the Anker Soundcore Life P3i earbuds offer a surprisingly solid performance. Don't expect elite ANC, but these <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-earbuds-amazon" target="_self">affordable earbuds</a> don't require too much of a sacrifice in sound quality.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>We're going to start with the major hitch of these earbuds: switching between devices sucks. They don't have multipoint pairing, and if you want to use them with your phone after using them with your laptop, you have to manually disconnect them (or in our experience, sometimes outright unpair them), with your laptop first. It's easily their biggest flaw, and most obvious indicator of their price point.</p><p>With that out of the way, these earbuds still have <em>a lot</em> going for them. For starters, they cost $50, and can often be found on sale for even less. For that price, you get earbuds that are comfortable to wear all day, have a custom equalizer in the app plus 21 presets (we're fans of the Treble Booster), customizable touch controls for each earbud, and a battery life that outdoes the Apple AirPods Pro. You won't have extras like spatial audio, and the ANC leans on background hiss more than premium models, but not terribly so. For a pair of $50 earbuds, we're impressed, and we recommend them for anyone who doesn't want to shell out $100 plus for a pair of noise-cancelling earbuds.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> 7 hours with ANC, 8.5 without (36 hours with charging case)</em> | <strong><em>App-connected:</em></strong><em> Yes | <strong>Colors:</strong></em><em> Black, white</em></p><hr><h2><strong>How we tested the best noise-cancelling headphones and earbuds</strong></h2><p>Every single pair of headphones we included on this list was hands-on tested by a Mashable reporter or editor. What exactly makes a good noise-cancelling headphone? Here's what we considered: the effectiveness of active noise cancellation in relation to price, comfort, battery life, audio quality, and any premium features offered (like spatial audio) and how those features perform. </p><p>We pulled these recommendations from our existing pool of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/headphones" target="_self">headphone reviews</a> and from hands-on testing performed specifically for this buying guide. A couple of options that didn't make our updated list include the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-max-review" target="_self">AirPods Max</a>, which do have good ANC and sound quality, but also a less impressive feature to price ratio, especially compared to newer options from Sony and Bose. We also tested the <strong>JBL Tour One M2</strong> headphones, and while we appreciated their excellent multipoint pairing, battery life, and balanced sound, we didn't find that their noise cancellation matched up with similarly priced headphones.</p><p>As of Jan. 2024, we removed the Bowers &amp; Wilkins PX7 headphones from this list not because they're not excellent headphones (they are), but because they're an older model that's harder to find in-stores and online these days. We're in the process of testing the <strong>Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px7 S2e </strong>headphones to see how they stack up. And as of April 2024, we've added the <strong>Anker Soundcore Life P3i earbuds</strong>, <strong>Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds</strong>, and <strong>Sony ULT Wear</strong> headphones to our list of recommendations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

   <em><strong>UPDATE: May. 11, 2024, 5:00 a.m. EDT </strong>Two top picks in this story have shifted after Mashable writers were able to hands-on test CES 2024 releases from Roborock and Eufy in their own homes.</em>
</p>
<p>Nearly any robot vacuum can sufficiently clear a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuums-for-hardwood-floors" target="_self">hardwood</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuums-for-tile-floors" target="_self">tile</a>, or laminate floor of the hair and crumbs blowing across it like tumbleweeds. But a robot vacuum working on carpet requires much more meticulousness to uproot the debris embedded in the pile.</p><p>In homes with more than hard floors and light foot traffic, buying the cheapest robot vacuum you can find will likely create <em>more</em> hassle than it's worth. Every time that bot gets stuck on a rug corner or welcomes you home to pet hair still visibly clinging to the living room carpet, you'd probably rather just do the job yourself &mdash;&nbsp;but rest assured that that's not an inevitable experience with every robot vacuum. Not if you buy one specifically designed to master carpet. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The best robot vacuums for carpet have powerful suction, of course, aided by brush roll systems specifically designed to attract small debris and pinch large pieces while still managing hair tangling. And if they're good on carpet &mdash;&nbsp;the hardest floor type to tackle &mdash;&nbsp;these models won't let you down on other floor types, either.</p><p>The Mashable team is on a continuous mission to narrow down those options for you. We've hands-on tested dozens of robot vacuums on several pile lengths of carpets, rugs, and bath mats in a variety of home layouts. Here are our favorites for every carpeted situation in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a world where everyone gets a super power at the age of 18, Jen (M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad Tyers) is an outlier. She&rsquo;s 25, and she&rsquo;s completely ordinary. Her best friend can commune with the dead. Her stepsister is super strong.

But Jen never got her power, and she's miserable about it.

Whether it's a few months, two years, or close to the decade that these two characters experience, most viewers will recall some sort of sustained romantic turmoil in their own lives that mirrors this.

<p>This FX miniseries dramatizes the 70's feminist attempts to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment and conservative spokeswoman Phyllis Schlafly's campaign to stop the ERA in its tracks. </p><p>Cate Blanchett plays Schlafly, whose conservative values clashed with the idea that political, civil, and legal rights should be equally extended to American men and woman. Rose Byrne plays legendary feminist activist Gloria Steinem, who supported the law. <em>Mrs. America</em> tells a heightened version of the incredible history of the ERA and the swaths of American women who fought for and opposed equal rights on the basis of sex and gender, and like many historical dramas is as <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mrs-america-hulu-review" target="_self">entertaining as it is occasionally infuriating</a>.<em>&mdash; A.N.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/Ykmo4?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Mrs.%20America&object_type=article&object_uuid=01xNCniKNDW3TckOihON3cY&short_url=Ykmo4&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Mrs. America</em></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/Ykmo4?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Hulu.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01xNCniKNDW3TckOihON3cY&short_url=Ykmo4&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"> is now streaming on Hulu.</a></p><h2><strong>21. <em>Woke</em></strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

The best VPN for unblocking and watching Xnxx is <a href="https://go.expressvpn.com/c/1442494/1462856/16063" target="_blank">ExpressVPN</a>.</p><hr><p>There is a time and place for visiting your <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-porn" target="_self">favorite porn sites</a>. There are a lot of locations around the world that block access to sites like <a href="https://mashable.com/category/pornhub" target="_self">Pornhub</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/xhamster" target="_self">xHamster</a>, and that's probably for the best. However, there is something to be said for retaining your online freedom (when the time is right).</p><p>We're not suggesting that you bypass online restrictions to access porn sites in inappropriate moments, but sometimes you'll want to watch your <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-hookup-apps-uk" target="_self">favorite sites</a> in a totally appropriate time and place, but you won't be able to do that because a block is in place. In this situation, you should consider using a <a href="https://mashable.com/deals/vpn-deals" target="_self">VPN</a>.</p><p>If you're looking for the best way to unblock sites like Xnxx from anywhere in the world, we have the information you need.</p><h2><strong>How to unblock Xnxx for free</strong></h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/deals/vpn-deals" target="_self">VPNs</a> can hide your real IP address (digital location) and connect you to secure servers in other locations.

<h2><strong>What is Google I/O?</strong></h2><p>Google I/O is a developer conference held by the tech giant in the U.S. every year. Initially called Google Developer Day when it first took place in 2007, the annual event's name was changed to Google I/O for its second year &mdash; a moniker which has stuck since.</p><p>"A googol is a one, followed by 100 zeroes, so that's where the I/O name and logo came from," <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/google-io-meaning/" target="_blank">Google's director of US events Lorin Platto explained last year.</a> "We just took the first one and zero, and we left off all the other zeroes. It all goes back to Google."</p><p>The conference includes <a href="https://io.google/2024/explore/#my-io-2024" target="_blank">numerous talks and workshops</a> advising developers how they can use Google's products. However, the average person will primarily be interested in two sessions: <a href="https://io.google/2024/explore/a6eb8619-5c2e-4671-84cb-b938c27103be/" target="_blank">the Google keynote</a> and <a href="https://io.google/2024/explore/af9317b5-1c42-471a-99db-1bc8108d06a8/" target="_blank">the Developer keynote</a>. With Google I/O having been the platform for big product announcements in the past, any significant reveals are likely to take place during these sessions. Google I/O was previously used to launch Android, Google Assistant, and Google Home.</p><h2><strong>When is Google I/O 2024?</strong></h2><p>This year Google I/O will take place from Tuesday, May 14. Google's keynote is scheduled to start the proceedings at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET, with the Developer keynote set to follow at 1:30 p.m. PT / 4:30 p.m. ET. The 2024 event will run for two days, though in the past it has been as short as one or as long as three.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Where is Google I/O 2024?</strong></h2><p>Google I/O 2024 will take place at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California. The Shoreline Amphitheatre is an outdoor venue with a capacity of 22,500 people, though Google has stated that this year's event will only have a <a href="https://io.google/2024/about/" target="_blank">"small live audience."</a> Google I/O has been held at the Shoreline Ampitheatre almost every year since 2016, the only exceptions being when it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, then conducted entirely online in 2021.</p><p>The annual conference has since been held both in-person and online, allowing developers around the world to join in for free.</p><h2><strong>How to watch Google I/O 2024</strong></h2><p>If you aren't attending this year's Google I/O in person, you can still watch a livestream of the keynotes on Google's official YouTube channel. The video is embedded below:</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-6HfJXnXCya0"></div>
</div>


<p>The nerds won't have to miss out Google I/O's technical and educational information either. All content will be available on demand from Thursday, May 16 at 8 a.m. PT / 11 a.m. ET on the <a href="https://io.google/2024/" target="_blank">Google I/O website</a>, and will even be translated into different languages. Google has also stated that some content such as captioned videos might be viewable "shortly after the event."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sort of.&nbsp;</p><p>In the first episode of Season 2, titled "What Can the Damned Really Say to the Damned," Sam Reid reprises his role to torment Lestat's treacherous children. But not exactly as you might expect. He's not flesh and blood &mdash; though he is bleeding profusely. In <em>Interview with the Vampire: Part II</em>, as the second season's opening title card calls it, Lestat's return to Louis begins as a delusion.&nbsp;</p><p>How did we get here? For those in need of a refresher: At the end of Season 1 of AMC's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/interview-with-the-vampire-amc" target="_self">audacious adaptation of </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/interview-with-the-vampire-amc" target="_self"><em>Interview with the Vampire</em></a><em>, </em>Lestat was ambushed by his vampire family, Louis de Pointe du Lac (Jacob Anderson) and Claudia (Bailey Bass), then left for dead in the swampy dumps of New Orleans. When human journalist Daniel Molloy (Eric Bogosian) interviews Louis decades later &mdash;&nbsp;with Claudia's diaries in hand &mdash;&nbsp;he calls Louis out for knowing damn well that attack wouldn't kill the vampire Lestat. </p><p>Could this be true? Will the real Lestat catch up with Louis and Claudia as they search for a coven that might be more cuddly than the Brat Prince?&nbsp;</p><p>Let's dig in.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How does Lestat return in <em>Interview with the Vampire?&nbsp;</em></strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In "What Can the Damned Really Say to the Damned," Lestat resurrects from his shallow grave as a bad dream, a guilty conscience, or a delusion. Pick your poison.&nbsp;</p><p>Guided by old-world legends, Louis and Claudia (now played by Delainey Hayles) have left the luxuries of New Orleans behind for battle-torn squalor in Europe during World War I. There, as Claudia scours for evidence of vampires and searches the pockets of dead soldiers for camping essentials, Lestat returns to Louis &mdash;&nbsp;a vision with a slit throat and a smile.&nbsp;</p><p>"Bonjour, mon amour," Lestat says, adding, "Do you miss me? I miss you &mdash;&nbsp;despite our recent unpleasantness." What a cool, casual way to refer to your lover plotting to kill you, then fleeing the country! At this point it's been "four years of grim wayfaring," and Louis is mad with grief. Or as he puts it, "You're not here, I'm just fucked in the head."&nbsp;</p><p>Lestat taunts him with playful banter that's cut off by a live bat crawling out of his slit throat and flying into the night. But the maybe-slain sire will not accept apologies. "You ruin it with remorse," Lestat scolds Louis, "You gave me a death of distinction." </p><p>Now, even if this Lestat is just Louis' guilty conscience, this line suggests Louis believes Lestat is really dead. But then Lestat declares, "But in answer to your question: Yes. I'm going to fucking kill you."</p><p>Louis argues in response that <em>if </em>Lestat were alive, he'd already have tracked them down and murdered them by now. Again, it's been four years. To this Lestat says with a wicked grin, "Oh love, I'm merely waiting until you're happy. So hurry up, mon cher!"&nbsp;</p><p>Next, this vision of Lestat lovingly bites Louis's neck, as Louis grimaces in a pain reflected in the voice-over: "I had taken 7,000 souls by then. But Lestat's was the only one that felt like murder."&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What does it mean that Lestat is back?&nbsp;</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Well, for one thing, it means showrunner Rolin Jones knows what his audience wants. </p><p>In season 1, Anderson and Reid had a passion so hot it threatened to burn viewers down in their awe and longing. It wasn't just that Jones gave explicit sex scenes between the two where Rice had not. It was also that the chemistry between these actors was explosive, and the toxic romance between Louis and Lestat as chaotic as it was compelling.&nbsp;</p><p>This first chapter back is alive with twisted turns, including revenants, Romanian superstition, and an ancient vampire choosing a fiery exit over a new lease on undead life. But amid the unrelenting muck and grays of this grisly chapter, Jones smartly laid in a bit of tried and true (and entertaining) toxicity, as only Lestat can give it. </p><p>While Louis tries to keep these delusions to himself, his regret &mdash;&nbsp;and lingering love for Lestat &mdash;&nbsp;is a gulf widening between him and Claudia. He asks her when they can go home, and in doing so refuses to see that New Orleans is not home to her; home is what she is seeking as she digs for other vampires. Her diaries reflect her ire, and Louis weeps remembering more clearly who she was &mdash;&nbsp;even if that means more sharply understanding how she had come to loathe him.&nbsp;</p><p>In the flashbacks of their time in Romania, Claudia snarls at Louis, "I forgave you for fucking up my plan. I did not forgive you for bringing <em>him </em>with you." Louis argues that sure, he didn't set Lestat on fire as Claudia wanted &mdash;&nbsp;but their bad dad is in a landfill a continent away. "In <em>here,</em>" she responds, prodding at Louis's chest. "You carry him in here." It's a sin Louis cannot deny, a fate he cannot escape. &nbsp;</p><p>Later, after the two have seen more deaths that hang on them like an anchor, Louis offers a pep talk to Claudia, spurring her to hope. "As long as you walk the earth, I'll never taste the fire," he declares, promising never to leave her. "You understand? We're going to find others like us." Violin music plays in the background, frenzied and hopeful. "If you were the last vampire on earth," he says softly, "it would be enough."&nbsp;</p><p>In the shot, he's looking dead into Claudia's mournful eyes. But then the camera shifts to the right, revealing Lestat, throat still slit, eyes sharp, pouty lips in a slight smile. So, who is Louis really talking to? "Me and you. You and me." He repeats it over and over, perhaps willing himself to believe he means him and Claudia. Perhaps he says this to chase away the memory of Lestat.&nbsp;But as this tormented family arrives in Paris at episode's end, book readers know the real Lestat's return is drawing ever nearer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/LbGMZ?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Interview%20with%20the%20Vampire%3A%20Part%20II%20airs%20Sundays%20on%20AMC%20and%20AMC%2B.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=02EUXVxi3JrBcrlkujfzFvY&amp%3Bshort_url=LbGMZ&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelios-preview.mashable.com%2Farticle%2Fraglan-james-talamasca-body-thief-interview-with-the-vampire&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Interview%20with%20the%20Vampire%3A%20Part%20II%20airs%20Sundays%20on%20AMC%20and%20AMC%2B.&object_type=article&object_uuid=04BiWpUwwE9RVU2UcJhP3gv&short_url=LbGMZ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Interview with the Vampire: Part II</em> airs Sundays on AMC and AMC+.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for May 11's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple.

However, a similar effect happens near Antarctica, too.&nbsp;</p><p>The sun had <a href="https://x.com/NWSSWPC/status/1789701662757581066" target="_blank">a strong solar flare</a> &mdash; a gigantic burst of energy &mdash; at 12:26 p.m. ET Sunday. This flare was classified as <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/solarcycle25/2024/05/12/strong-flare-erupts-from-sun/" target="_blank">an X-1.0</a>, among the most intense flares observed. Experts warned the incident could create temporary problems or lost signals for users of high-frequency radio communication.</p><p>"Solar flares send tons of energy whizzing through space at the speed of light," according to <a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/spaceweather/en/" target="_blank">NASA</a>.

<p>An aurora's display of colors is the result of electrons shot out of the sun during solar storms. As the charged particles reach Earth, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mars-green-wormlike-aurora-image" target="_self">they travel along the planet's invisible magnetic field lines</a> into the atmosphere, interacting with the air. When those particles strike gasses, they heat up and glow, according to NASA.</p><p>The colors differ depending on the type of atmospheric gas and its altitude. Oxygen glows red or blue, while nitrogen can create green, blue, or pink. The recent strong solar storm conditions are causing the aurora around the north pole to be much more widespread, allowing people who live farther south to see them.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Similar to storm seasons on Earth, the sun experiences <a href="https://mashable.com/article/solar-flares-sun-active-why" target="_self">a weather pattern that repeats every 11 years</a>. At the beginning and end of the cycle, that activity is at its calmest. But solar activity increases, climaxing in the middle of the cycle and causing the sun to roil with giant eruptions.</p><p>Right now that cycle is about to peak, close to reaching <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-sun-sunspots-images" target="_self">its maximum point</a> in mid-2025. That's why reports of solar flares and coronal mass ejections &mdash; plasma spewed from the sun's outer atmosphere, called the corona &mdash; are more abundant in the news.</p><p>Coronal mass ejections like the ones approaching Earth, or CMEs, are referred to as "space weather." Though the sun is about <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-hot-is-sun-nasa" target="_self">93 million miles away</a>, space weather can affect Earth and other parts of the solar system.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Scientists have a limited ability to forecast space weather. Here, the atmosphere and magnetic field shield people against the most <a href="https://mashable.com/article/solar-eruption-space-radiation-danger" target="_self">harmful health impacts</a> of solar radiation. However, these events can have catastrophic consequences on technology, disrupting power grids, telecommunications, and GPS systems.</p><p>Though these incidents don&rsquo;t happen often, a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/sun_darkness.html" target="_blank">solar flare in March 1989</a>, for example, caused all of Quebec, Canada, to experience a 12-hour power outage. It also jammed radio signals for Radio Free Europe.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Prior to Sunday's flare, the sun ejected <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/solarcycle25/2024/05/11/sun-releases-2-strong-flares-2/" target="_blank">two other strong solar flares</a> just before 9:30 p.m. ET Friday and 8 a.m. ET Saturday, according to NASA. The U.S. space agency's <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/sdo" target="_blank">Solar Dynamics Observatory</a>, which watches the sun constantly, has snapped pictures of these events as well. The previous two flares were classified as X-5.8 and X-1.5, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>NOAA, which is <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">continuing to monitor the storm</a> for the U.S. government, said these flares seem to be linked to a sunspot estimated to be perhaps 15 times wider than Earth.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Whether you're in marketing or just accidentally ended up with a really popular Instagram account, a ton of different skills go into creating quality content. You might need to write one day, find a fun picture the next, and record a podcast the week after. It's a lot for one person (or maybe even a team of people) to handle. But it's not too much for AI.&nbsp;</p><p>Scribbyo is a <a href="https://zdcs.link/vdrXE?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=content%20creation%20platform&object_type=article&object_uuid=04LVq3woeaovaR6ZGC0u9RC&short_url=vdrXE&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">content creation platform</a> that uses AI tools to help save you time.

<p>Scribbyo doesn't just use one voice to read your text. You get access to 100+ accents and languages and more than 900 types of voices. Whether you're making a podcast, narrating a presentation, or recording a voiceover for a video, you can take your time finding just the right voice.</p><p>This subscription lasts for life, but there are limits on how much you can generate every month.

Gone are the days of the complimentary charging block, and it's only a matter of time before the humble charging cable becomes a relic of the past, too. That's why this is the ideal time to try charging pads &mdash; your desk will thank you for the instant declutter.</p><p>The 3-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charging Pad can finally let you kick the rat's nest of wires on your desk into the trash. As you can tell by the name, it's designed to <a href="https://zdcs.link/EyljM?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=charge%20three%20devices%20at%20once&object_type=article&object_uuid=05xVgVfHpmlRomX23IuY3Xu&short_url=EyljM&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">charge three devices at once</a>, and through the end of the day, it's on sale for almost $35 off at $34.99 (reg. $69.99). However, <strong>if you want to charge your devices all at once, you will need to use a PD18W wall adapter (not included)</strong>.</p><p>With three separate charging modules, this pad can accommodate smartphones, headphones, watches, and other devices compatible with wireless charging. Want to top up three phones at once? No problem. A watch and two headphones? Easy. The combination doesn't matter; it handles them all efficiently and simultaneously.</p><p>While there's a maximum power of 15W for cell phone charging, 5W for AirPods charging, and 2.5W for Apple Watch charging, it can still refuel your devices fairly quickly. The charging plates are also designed to secure the devices firmly, and when you're not charging, you can fold and configure them to <a href="https://zdcs.link/EyljM?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=function%20as%20a%20phone%20stand&object_type=article&object_uuid=05xVgVfHpmlRomX23IuY3Xu&short_url=EyljM&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">function as a phone stand</a>.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>On the safety front, it packs a multifunctional SmartShunt technology with a built-in smart chip, along with features like short-circuit protection, foreign-object detection, and temperature control. It's also quite portable, allowing you to take it from point A to point B with ease. It barely takes up any space, so you can easily put it into your pocket or bag.</p><p>Untangle your harware with this <a href="https://zdcs.link/EyljM?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=3-in-1%20wireless%20charger%2C%20on%20sale%20for%20%2434.99&object_type=article&object_uuid=05xVgVfHpmlRomX23IuY3Xu&short_url=EyljM&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">3-in-1 wireless charger, on sale for $34.99</a> for a limited time.</p><p><a href="https://www.stacksocial.com/" target="_blank"><em>StackSocial</em></a><em> prices subject to change.</em></p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

For gay men, online <a href="https://mashable.com/category/dating" target="_self">dating</a> throws a unique<em> </em>set of challenges into the mix. On top of the usual woes, such as ghosting and catfishing, you might encounter unnecessary questioning about your past, straight guys who shouldn't be in your feed, and even some not-so-subtle fetishization.

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/02/key-findings-about-online-dating-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center</a>, about one-quarter of LGBTQ+ adults say they met their match through online dating. The problem? Not all <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps" target="_self">dating apps</a> are created equal, especially for the LGBTQ+ community. </p><h2>What is the best gay dating app?</h2><p>While Grindr is a big name, there are other options that cater to the specific needs and preferences of gay men.</p><p>"Grindr is a tried and true app that many queer men gravitate toward to find partners or for relationships that require lesser commitment, so it&rsquo;s easy to point to it as the #1 app," <a href="https://centerformodernrelationships.com/staff-directory/michelle-herzog-lmft-cst" target="_blank">Michelle Herzog</a>, LMFT, AASECT-certified sex therapist, tells Mashable. "However, like Tinder, it&rsquo;s gained a reputation as a hookup app &ndash; but that doesn&rsquo;t mean there still aren&rsquo;t men looking for long-term commitments, either."</p><p>Sometimes going for a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-popular-dating-apps-and-sites" target="_self">popular dating app</a> can be your best bet since that's where queer users tend to mingle in the biggest numbers. Keeping Tinder on the back burner isn't just a straight people thing (especially for those of us who live in less-populated areas where Grindr and Scruff offer slim pickings). You can also try niche dating sites if you tend to like a certain type of man, but in general, the more popular apps offer the greatest chance of success.</p><p>Plus, some mainstream apps deserve credit for <em>trying </em>to create a more inclusive atmosphere. OkCupid gets kudos for embracing change and making social justice a core part of its compatibility scoring.</p><p>Whether you're looking for something serious, a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps" target="_self">hookup</a>, something that stays strictly online, or an altogether different definition of connection, there's an ideal queer dating app out there for you. Here's a breakdown of the best dating apps for gay men to help you find your perfect match.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/06eqNViGzQE0uv2HGHpXc30/hero-image.jpg" alt="illustrated middle-aged singles on a date playing mini golf"><p>Deciding to get back into the dating game can be nerve-wracking, regardless of age. But the stakes may feel a little higher if you're in your 40s (or older).</p><p>You may assume that people in your age bracket either aren't interested in dating or are already settled into long-term relationships. However, according to a recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/06/28/a-record-high-share-of-40-year-olds-in-the-us-have-never-been-married/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center analysis</a> of Census Bureau data, as of 2021, nearly 25 percent of 40-somethings in the U.S. have never been married. Additionally, only 22 percent of unmarried adults ages 40 to 44 were cohabiting couples. </p><p>So, have people in their 40s given up on finding love? Not at all. But unlike people in their 20s and 30s, they know what they want and aren't afraid to wait a little longer to find the right person. In fact, according to the analysis, approximately one in four 40-year-olds who weren't married in 2001 had tied the knot by age 60. So, if this trend continues, there's still hope for finding a long-term partner, even if you're starting later in life.</p><h2>How to start dating again at 40</h2><p>Now, after that speech and spew of statistics, you're probably wondering what our grand plan is to get you back on your feet and out on the dance floor. The answer? <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps" target="_self">Online dating</a>. Before you scoff, hear us out.</p><p>Online dating is a great way to meet new people in a low-pressure environment. It gives you a quick and easy way to connect with potential partners, filter through profiles, and find matches who share your interests and values. Imagine if you could do that when scanning the room at a bar or attending social events &mdash; it would save you a lot of time and effort.</p><p>But before you start swiping left and right, check in with yourself. Be honest about what you're looking for in a partner and what you bring to the table, including any emotional baggage you might carry (which we all have to some extent).</p><p>Once you've touched base with your emotions, you should do the same with your dating profile. Are you interested in a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships" target="_self">serious relationship</a>, a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps" target="_self">casual encounter</a>, or a friendship that could evolve into something more? Whatever it is, be upfront. You don't want to fall for someone only to realize they aren't looking for the same thing. </p><div class="raw-embed">
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My mom&rsquo;s 60-something friend was set up with a 67-year-old guy who is &ldquo;not looking for anything serious&rdquo; in case you think that ever ends</p>&mdash; Sara K. Runnels (@omgskr) <a href="https://twitter.com/omgskr/status/1612150887321047046?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2023</a></blockquote>

<h2>What are the best dating apps for over 40 singles?</h2><p>The <em>best</em> dating app depends on what you're looking for. But because we're data nerds, we've done a little research (and hands-on testing) to give you some options.</p><p>Match and eharmony have a large over-40 user base and comprehensive profiles and algorithms that match you with compatible partners based on your preferences and personality traits. Additionally, Elite Singles is a popular dating site for mature professionals looking for a serious relationship.</p><p>Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble are more popular among younger users, but it's not impossible to find success on these apps if you're over 40. OkCupid has a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/07/17/dating-at-50-and-up-older-americans-experiences-with-online-dating/" target="_blank">slightly higher number</a> of older singles than Bumble and Hinge, and it caters to the liberal and LGBTQ+ communities, offering a space to be your most authentic self sans judgment.</p><p>Keep reading for a more in-depth look at each of these dating apps and what they have to offer for daters over 40. We considered affordability, accessibility (including user-friendly interfaces and availability on Google Play and the App Store), and overall success rate in helping users find meaningful connections.</p><p><em>Pro tip: Based on our in-depth reviews, we recommend steering clear of Zoosk and Our Time for singles over 40. (Full details on our testing methodology are in the "How We Tested" section.)</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for May 11's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple.

<p>"The two sides have been finalizing terms for a pact to use ChatGPT features in Apple&rsquo;s iOS 18," said Gurman. We don't know yet what those features will be, but insiders say <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ios-18-ai-features" target="_self">Apple might leverage generative AI to improve existing apps</a> and services. That could include summarization capabilities for Messages and Safari, and improved Spotlight Search on the home screen. </p><p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/business/apple-siri-ai-chatgpt.html" target="_blank"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, Apple is also <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-wants-to-revamp-siri" target="_self">planning a major overhaul of Siri</a>, meaning the voice assistant could get <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-new-ai-3-ways-siri-could-beat-chatgpt" target="_self">way smarter and more capable with a generative AI boost</a>. Speaking of voice assistants, OpenAI is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-announcement-monday-voice-assistant" target="_self">reportedly developing</a> its own voice assistant. But it's unclear whether that is a part of the conversation with Apple, or whether it will be positioned as a Siri competitor. </p><p>To make things more confusing, Apple is also reportedly <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-google-gemini-iphone" target="_self">in talks with Google</a> about bringing Gemini's generative AI features to Apple devices, but according to the outlet, those talks haven't led to an agreement yet. Still with us? <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-release-mysterious-ai-updates-monday-gpt-4-chatgpt" target="_self">OpenAI's Monday livestream</a> might be about the alleged voice assistant, and the very next day, Google will hold its developer conference, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-i-o-may-14-event-android-15-surface-pro-what-to-expect" target="_self">Google I/O</a>, which is expected to have Gemini and other generative AI announcements. </p><p>It's a lot to keep track of, but it's all unfolding over the next month and kicking off on Monday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This shift from Apple's top executives came about, the <em>Times</em> says, after they were wowed by ChatGPT.

<p>Around the same time the <em>Times</em>' story was published, a related report saying that Apple is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-openai-finalizing-terms-bringing-chatgpt-ios18" target="_self">close to finalizing a deal with OpenAI itself</a> came to light.</p><p>Historically, <a href="https://mashable.com/category/siri" target="_self">Siri</a> has struggled with maintaining conversations and understanding context in queries &mdash; limitations that newer AI like ChatGPT and Google's Gemini seem to have overcome. Siri was first introduced in 2011 and has not received a major update since. The revamp of Siri is part of a broader initiative within Apple to advance its AI capabilities, as we saw at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-may-7-event-ipad-air-oled-ipad-pro-ai-features" target="_self">Apple's iPad announcement</a> event earlier this week.</p><p>This update is expected to be unveiled at the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-wwdc-2023-everything-announced-preorder" target="_self">Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC)</a> in June. Expected upgrades include an enhanced Siri that can be more conversational, and the ability to use context from one request to make it easier to understand another (i.e., understanding, according to the <em>Times, </em>that "if someone asked for the weather in San Francisco and then said, 'What about New York?' that user wanted another forecast"). </p><p>Additionally, Apple also plans to process a portion of AI-related data on-device rather than in cloud-based servers, which reduces costs.</p><p>To bolster its AI efforts, Apple has redirected resources, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-car-minivan-design" target="_self">notably halting a $10 billion autonomous car project</a>. It also helps that Apple has an extensive device network and advanced semiconductor technology which will no doubt enhance Siri's functionality compared to the likes of ChatGPT and Gemini.</p><p>As noted in the Times' piece, this would be Apple's most ambitious reorganization in almost a decade. A major fear of Apple's top execs is reportedly that the AI competitors of iOS could eventually come to dominate in the smartphone software market. Thus, the company's success will largely depend on its ability to seamlessly integrate these generative AI systems without compromising the core experiences Apple users rely on.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mashable reached out to OpenAI for comment, and will update this story if we hear back.</p><p>Last September, OpenAI rolled out <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-chatgpt-voice-chat-multimodal-image-capabilities" target="_self">voice and image capabilities</a>, claiming "ChatGPT can now see, hear, and speak." (Sidenote: ChatGPT can't technically <em>do</em> any of those things, because it's not a living being, but it can process images and audio in real-time, mimicking human senses.)</p><p>In the announcement, OpenAI demo-ed ChatGPT's ability to troubleshoot problems with a bike seat, and with the help of synthetic voices, casually chat with a user instead of providing text responses. The outlet reported that the new model would bring these modalities together.</p><p>The Information noted that a voice assistant is currently too big to run on personal devices, but a cloud-based service could be deployed for customer service agents and could recognize when a customer is being sarcastic. </p><p>However, the moment this technology gets into the hands of users is when its transformative potential will become clear. </p><p>Speaking of which, OpenAI is reportedly in talks with Apple about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-11/apple-closes-in-on-deal-with-openai-to-put-chatgpt-on-iphone?srnd=homepage-americas&amp;sref=9hGJlFio" target="_blank">integrating ChatGPT with iOS 18</a>, which the public expects to hear more about at Apple's developer conference <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-wwdc-announcement-2024" target="_self">WWDC</a> in June. Concurrently, Apple is planning a major overhaul of its voice assistant Siri per <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/business/apple-siri-ai-chatgpt.html" target="_blank"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. </p><p>If that weren't enough, Google is expected to announce Gemini updates at its developer conference, Google I/O on Tuesday. Google is also reportedly in talks with Apple about <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-google-gemini-iphone" target="_self">bringing Gemini to the iPhone</a>. So despite OpenAI&rsquo;s close ties to Microsoft, reports of a deepening association with Apple &mdash; even though Apple is also reportedly talking to Google &mdash; hint at the possibility that generative AI is helping to build intertwined super-entities with uneasy alliances.</p><p>But whatever happens at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-io-2024-date" target="_self">Google I/O</a> and Apple WWDC, it comes after OpenAI's mysterious announcement on Monday.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>With OpenAI <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-plans-announce-google-search-competitor-monday-sources-say-2024-05-09/" target="_blank">poised to announce its search engine in a matter of days</a>, I/O 2024 is expected to be an important event, not only for developers and tech enthusiasts but also for Google. The company is also facing opposition from Apple, which is not only in talks with OpenAI but also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-01/could-apple-replace-google-with-own-search-engine-it-s-possible-but-unlikely-ln7gywed" target="_blank">has been rumored to be building its own Google-like products for some time now</a>. </p><p>Scheduled on the heels of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-event-2024-ipad-everything-announced" target="_self">Apple's surprisingly revealing iPad event</a>, Google will more than likely be eager to reveal how its tech ecosystem will be peppered with generative AI features.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know to tune in:</p><h2><strong>When is the Google I/O 2024 event?</strong></h2><p>The event is scheduled for Tuesday, May 14, 2024, at 10 a.m. PT.

<h2><strong>What to Expect:</strong></h2><h3>Android 15</h3><p>I/O is set to be a pivotal event for unveiling the latest Android version, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/android-15-preview-release-date" target="_self">Android 15</a>. The initial betas have introduced features such as an updated <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-privacy-sandbox-update" target="_self">Privacy Sandbox</a>, partial screen sharing options, system-level app archiving, enhanced satellite connectivity, more in-app camera controls, and a new power efficiency mode. </p><p>The majority of Android 15 updates, however, are expected to be revealed at the conference. <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-features-3401939/" target="_blank">According to Android Authority</a>, some key anticipated features include satellite messaging, potential lock screen widgets for tablets, a new At a Glance widget for phones, a redesigned status bar, and improved battery health monitoring. </p><p>The event may also highlight third-party assistant integrations for Alexa and ChatGPT that could allow you to use the latter hands-free, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-voice-activation-3400208/" target="_blank">as rumored by Android Authority</a>. There may also be plans to introduce a privacy-focused feature called <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/android-15s-private-space-feature-could-better-protect-your-sensitive-data/" target="_blank">Private Space</a> &mdash; which is expected to bring notable privacy enhancements.</p><h3>Google Gemini</h3><p>Speaking of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/artificial-intelligence" target="_self">AI</a>, Google will spotlight its latest developments with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-gemini-chatgpt-ai-rival-tip-real-time-responses" target="_self">Gemini</a>, the AI chatbot previously known as Bard. The discussions will likely cover how Gemini AI is being incorporated into various Google products such as Android, Google Search, and Workspace &mdash; underlining the company's commitment to integrating AI across its ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-11/apple-closes-in-on-deal-with-openai-to-put-chatgpt-on-iphone?srnd=homepage-americas&amp;sref=9hGJlFio" target="_blank">As reported by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman</a>, Apple is finalizing a deal with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into iOS. Apple wants to do the same with Gemini but those plans are still being discussed with no deal reached.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-io-2024-how-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank">According to WIRED</a>, whatever Google announces on the AI front may be an insight into what Apple has in store for the World Wide Developers Conference in June.</p><h3>Pixel Fold</h3><p>Alongside these software developments, Google may give us an update on some of its hardware developments, particularly the next iteration of the Pixel Fold, which was introduced at I/O 2023. If rumors <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-fold-2/" target="_blank">reported on by Android Police</a> are to be believed, the new Fold will feature a larger cover screen, increased RAM, and expanded storage capacities &mdash; although the event might see a limited number of hardware announcements as Google increasingly prioritizes software and AI integration.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>So, don't hold high expectations for this, and if you were expecting news on the Pixel 9, sorry to disappoint.</p><h3>WearOS</h3><p><a href="https://io.google/2024/explore/19faa1a5-5b4f-4e7a-ac06-8564a5a324af/" target="_blank">As confirmed in the conference's session list</a>, definitely expect to hear about Wear OS 5. TechRadar writes that Wear OS 5 is anticipated to debut on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7. This news could be announced either at I/o or during Samsung's Unpacked event rumored for July, with shipping expected in August.</p><p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/wear-os-5" target="_blank">As TechRadar notes</a>, leaks suggest that Samsung is working to integrate Wear OS 5 with its new Exynos 5535 chipset, which will first appear in the Galaxy Watch 7. However, Samsung&rsquo;s version of Wear OS 5 will feature the One UI Watch overlay, offering a customized user experience. </p><p>Those seeking a purer version of Wear OS 5 might have to wait for the Google Pixel Watch 3, expected to be released in October.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>The <a href="https://mashable.com/review/shark-flexstyle" target="_self">Shark FlexStyle</a> is our favorite <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dyson-airwrap-dupes" target="_self">Dyson AirWrap dupe</a>. In fact, when it comes to performance and a much lower price tag, we'd say the FlexStyle beats out the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/dyson-airwrap-complete" target="_self">AirWrap</a>. </p><p>Mashable Shopping Reporter Bethany Allard reviewed both devices and concluded, "If you're looking to switch to hot air styling to help your hair out for regular styling, the FlexStyle is 100 percent worth it. Though it has some minor flaws, at $280, those are much easier to look past than those of the Airwrap. Between the FlexStyle and the Airwrap, it's hard for me to imagine a reason why you'd opt for the latter unless you're into big purchases for the sake of big purchases, or if you're especially loyal to Dyson."</p><p>The FlexStyle is even cheaper today, on sale for $60 off at Best Buy, so it's a great day to grab one for the mother figure in your life.</p><h2>Best headphones deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>The Beats Studio Pro are an excellent pair of noise-canceling over-ear headphones that are also on sale for just $10 more than the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0C8PR4W22?context=search" target="_blank">lowest price we've seen</a>. These comfy headphones snagged a Mashable Choice award, and Mashable's Alex Perry noted their seamless connectivity to both Apple and Android devices in his <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-beats-studio-pro-headphones-review" target="_self">review</a> (something that could help out a tech-averse mom).</p><p>"High audio quality meets very long battery life in a portable form factor that makes the Beats Studio Pro work equally well at home or on the road," Perry said. "Sure, the price isn&rsquo;t what I would call 'low,' but anyone looking for a pair of noise-canceling over-ear headphones could do a heck of a lot worse than Beats Studio Pro."</p><p>Get them for 48% off today.</p><h2>Best fitness deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

We're talking about good old-fashioned dirty talk with a modern twist (think: video chat, sexy snaps, and erotic audio messages, with self-destructing features for added privacy). We made a lot of accounts to test the best sexting apps, and we've gathered our favorites below. You'll recognize some of them from our guide to the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps" target="_self">best dating apps</a>, and for more adult fun, check out our review of the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps" target="_self">best hookup apps</a>, too</p><h3>Once viewed as taboo, sexting is a mainstream way to communicate your desires</h3><p>According to a 2023 survey of U.S. adults by the market research platform <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1366831/us-sexting-prevalence/" target="_blank">Statista</a>, 77 percent of participants said they've sent at least one sext &mdash;&nbsp;that's up from 45 percent in 2019 and just 14 percent about 10 years ago. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>And we're pretty sure those numbers will rise as tech advances and societal norms evolve to become more accepting and inclusive of sexual expression.</p><p>Sexting isn't just a saucy way to get off; it's a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/guide-to-sexting-enthusiastic-consent" target="_self">great tool for building trust</a> and intimacy and sharing or exploring your wants and fantasies in a consensual and safe manner. It can also help you and your partner feel more connected and maintain a strong sexual bond (so the next time you get together IRL, it may be even hotter). This is especially true in <a href="https://mashable.com/gifts/long-distance-relationship-gift-ideas" target="_self">long-distance relationships</a> or during periods of physical separation.</p><h2>How to start sexting</h2><p>For some, just <em>the thought</em> of sending an explicit message or racy photo can be intimidating. (And that's OK!) There are so many apps and resources out there to help even the most novice sexters feel empowered and confident.</p><p>Not sure where to start?

<p>This standalone calendar with an HD smart display makes it easy to see what everyone's doing and where they're supposed to be at any given time. The calendar is compatible with Google Calendar, iCloud Calendar, Outlook Calendar, Cozi, and Yahoo, so you can easily sync whichever system your family is already using. It's also a touchscreen, so you can easily make changes and additions when you need to, and the free app means you can view everything and make changes on the go.</p><p>The Skylight Calendar also acts as a helpful chore chart, so each family member can check off daily chores as they get done and get rewards along the way. (Why not gamify chores to make them a bit more fun?) And if the question, "What's for dinner?" grates on the main chef in the house, you can integrate a meal plan so a quick look at the calendar can answer that question. </p><p>A five-minute family standup in front of the Skylight Calendar each morning could make each day flow with ease and make forgotten lunches and baseball gloves a thing of the past. If you weren't quite on top of it to grab a <a href="https://mashable.com/gifts/best-mothers-day-gifts-sentimental" target="_self">sentimental Mother's Day gift</a> this year, at least you can dedicate yourself to helping your family get organized and take some of the workload off mom this year. </p>]]></content:encoded>

With its pastel cover featuring a competitive figure skater and hockey team captain, the book has the look of a classic rom-com for teens. It's anything but that. </p><p><em>Icebreaker</em>, part of the Maple Hill series by author Hannah Grace, is what BookTokkers call a "spicy" read. Translation? It contains graphic descriptions of sex. In this case, the main characters are college students. </p><p>The novel is so explicit that students at Carter's school are not permitted to read it on campus, and their parents are often discreetly contacted as a courtesy if their child is found reading it. Carter has spoken to parents who had no clue that <em>Icebreaker</em> is erotica. </p><p>"Parents are generally happy to receive that phone call," says Carter. </p><p>They're not alone in their surprise, as other parents demonstrated in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/parentingteenagers/comments/18ytl00/icebreaker_book/" target="_blank">a Reddit thread about <em>Icebreaker</em></a> a few months ago.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

    </div>
<p>While <em>Icebreaker </em>was published last year, it continues to stir controversy on BookTok. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@datathegreat/video/7364134949886348590" target="_blank">In a recent video</a>, a bookseller commented on how the cover's cute design fools both young readers and their parents; he suggested the book and others like it get a sticker indicating they're for those 18 and above. (No such rating system currently exists.) The TikTok video has been viewed more than 886,000 times and received 1,600-plus comments. </p><p><em>Icebreaker</em> is a prime example of how BookTok has the power to steer tweens and young teens toward explicit or violent content, even as it encourages them to develop positive reading habits and helps them build community around books and ideas. </p><p>Experts like Carter say that parents should be curious about what their children are finding on BookTok. By paying close attention to their child's reading list, being ready to talk about difficult subjects like sex and violence, and helping their child identify signs that a book is too mature for them, parents can be a supportive presence. </p><p>By contrast, a hard-line approach that restricts books without discussion is likely to backfire. Carter says that tweens and teens, particularly on TikTok, are using their book selections as a form of self-expression. They want to be seen as mature enough to handle certain types of content, and they're doing so on a digital platform where the act of purchasing and displaying books gives them a sense of belonging to a broader community. </p><p>"I think that kids definitely want people to notice, like, 'Oh these are all the books I'm reading, and these books say something about me,'" says Carter. </p><h2>What to know about BookTok for tweens and teens</h2><p>Prior to the advent of social media, a curious tween or teen could certainly find titles with mature or explicit themes, says Mandie Caroll, books editor for Common Sense Media. </p><p>Caroll recalls being a young reader and encountering <em>The Clan of the Cave Bear</em>, a work of prehistoric fiction published in 1980 that depicts sexual assault. Later books in the series include consensual, graphic sex. </p><p>"In every generation there's going to be some way that kids discover sex in books," Caroll says. <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/book-reviews/icebreaker-maple-hills-book-1" target="_blank">Her own review of <em>Icebreaker</em></a><em> </em>describes it as containing "lots of graphic, erotic sex" and says it's for readers 17 and older.</p><p>The difference today is that these discoveries happen at the speed of social media, facilitated by influencers and algorithms. Gone are the days when romance novels geared toward adults could be spotted by their sultry covers. </p><p>Caroll says that instead book publishers often market romance titles for adults and young adults with more modern aesthetics, like the rom-com look of <em>Icebreaker</em>. So youth looking at the covers of "spicy" adult novels might mistakenly assume they contain little to no sexual content.</p><p>She adds that publishers are eager to find an audience for their novels on BookTok. According to one youth librarian recently <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/05/kids-reading-fun-books-decline-by-nine-crisis.html" target="_blank">interviewed by Slate</a>, BookTok can generate "huge bestsellers" in teen publishing, at a time when reading appears to be declining among kids between the ages of 8 and 12. </p><p>In addition to <em>Icebreaker</em>, Caroll says other sexually explicit books popular among younger readers but intended for older audiences include <em>Fourth Wing, </em>a romance-fantasy set in a war college for dragon riders, and <em>The Love Hypothesis</em>, a contemporary romance between a Ph.D. candidate and a young professor. </p><p>Both Caroll and Carter worry about BookTok recommendations for novels that depict sexual assault, domination, or "dubious consent" in the guise of a so-called dark romance. </p><p>Carter says that the 2021 novel <em>Haunting Adeline</em> continues to circulate amongst middle-school readers, even though it depicts stalking and a nonconsensual sex act with a firearm. </p><p><strong>"</strong>There are lots of what they label as 'spicy' novels that have some level of sexual assault," says Carter. &nbsp;</p><h2>How to help your child navigate BookTok</h2><p>Caroll says the reality of young adult BookTok means that parents truly cannot judge a book by its cover, or simply be so pleased that their child is reading that they don't explore the titles themselves.</p><p>In order to determine whether a book is appropriate for their child, she urges adults to flip through a novel before purchasing it, to read alongside them, or use resources like <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/book-reviews" target="_blank">Common Sense</a>, Goodreads, and Wikipedia to research its themes.</p><p>Caroll says that a parent worried about BookTok can start by telling their child that they may be exposed to books with scenes that are violent, sexual, or make them uncomfortable, and that the child can talk to them about it. </p><p>Though Common Sense does not believe in censoring what kids are reading, Caroll says parents may decide that certain books are just "absolutely not appropriate" for their child. </p><p>Either way, Caroll says that books offer parents an opportunity to talk about their child's interests and their family's values, in an open and nonjudgmental conversation. </p><p>To help young readers better understand their own limits, Carter says parents can talk to them about physiological signs that a book is too extreme or mature for them. These might include feeling sick to their stomach, or experiencing a racing heart, tense shoulders, or nightmares. </p><p>Tweens and teens might also consider how the book is playing a role in the rest of their day, and whether it's contributing to a general sense of anxiousness or unhealthy preoccupation. The solution may be to stop reading the book or to choose another genre altogether. </p><p>Carter says parents can also encourage their child to pause before purchasing a BookTok recommendation, particularly on a reading platform like Kindle. For a young reader who hasn't yet researched the title they purchased, an instant buy and download can rapidly lead to complex and confusing feelings. (Carter says many "spicy" novels are available on Kindle Unlimited.) </p><p>Though parents might feel similarly overwhelmed, Carter encourages them to start a conversation with their child with a simple question: "What are you reading today?"</p>]]></content:encoded>

It's not just a police procedural or legal drama; it's <em>the</em> police procedural and legal drama.

<h2>How to watch the original <em>Law &amp; Order</em></h2><p><em>Law &amp; Order </em>debuted on <a href="https://mashable.com/category/nbc" target="_self">NBC</a> in September 1990 as a straightforward procedural about the criminal justice system. Filmed on location in New York City, most episodes follow the same format: a criminal investigation, then a prosecution. Many episodes are based on real cases <a href="https://mashable.com/video/john-oliver-law-and-order" target="_self">ripped from the headlines</a>, although the show typically takes dramatic licenses.</p><p>During its lengthy run, <em>Law &amp; Order</em> has starred a rotating cast. However, some <a href="https://mashable.com/article/richard-belzer-dead-law-and-order" target="_self">major cast members</a> might look familiar, including Jerry Orbach, who portrayed Detective Lennie Briscoe for 12 seasons, Sam Waterston, who portrayed District Attorney Jack McCoy for 19 seasons, and S. Epatha Merkerson, who portrayed Lieutenant Anita Van Buren for 17 seasons.</p><h3>How many seasons are there?</h3><p>After 20 seasons, the series was unexpectedly cancelled in 2010. However, in 2021, NBC brought back the iconic series for its first season in over a decade &mdash; with long-time <em>Law &amp; Order</em> stars Waterston and Anthony Anderson. As of January 2024, the show is now in Season 23, with new episodes airing every Thursday at 8 p.m. ET on NBC.</p><h3>Where to stream every season</h3><p>Unfortunately, you can't stream <em>every</em> season of <em>Law &amp; Order</em> online. Thus is the reality of distribution and broadcasting rights in the streaming age. However, all hope is not lost. You can still watch many seasons online Here's your best options to watch the OG series.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>While YouTube TV has significantly more seasons of the beloved OG <em>Law &amp; Order</em>, it's also significantly more expensive than Peacock. While you can try it for free, it'll run you $57.99 per month for your first three months once you trial is up, then $72.99 per month thereafter for the base plan. Unfortunately for <em>Law &amp; Order </em>completists, there are still some gaps in the lineup.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

Like the OG series, it follows a similar dual narrative approach, taking audiences from the precinct to the courtroom and largely ripping details of its stories from actual headlines. <em>SVU</em>'s cases tend to be much more emotional and focus on sexual assault, domestic violence, human trafficking, and beyond.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/archive/mariska-hargitay-kesha" target="_self">Mariska Hargitay</a> has starred as Detective Olivia Benson since the show's inception, making her the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2024/01/18/law-and-order-svu-season-25-mariska-hargitay/72254431007/" target="_blank">longest-running character on primetime TV</a> and earning her a handful of awards.

While those two remain staples, like the original series, <em>SVU</em> has otherwise featured a rotating cast over the years.</p><h3>How many seasons are there?</h3><p>Currently in Season 25, new episodes of <em>Law &amp; Order: SVU</em> air on NBC Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><h3>Where to stream every season</h3><p>Unlike the original series, you can stream every season of <em>SVU</em> in one place &mdash;&nbsp;or, actually, two places.

<p>A Hulu subscription will run you $7.99 per month with ads or $17.99 without ads. The good news is, if you're new to the platform, you can score your first month for free. A single month probably isn't enough time to binge watch 24 seasons of <em>SVU</em>, but you can always try.</p><h2>How to watch <em>Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</em></h2><p>First airing in 2001 as the third spinoff, <em>Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</em> spent less time in the courtroom and more time dissecting the minds behind some of society's most horrific crimes. Major Case detectives focused on high-profile crimes like kidnapping, theft, and assassination threats. The rotating cast included Kathryn Erbe, <a href="https://mashable.com/archive/netflix-daredevil-vincent-donofrio" target="_self">Vincent D'Onofrio</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/courtney-b-vance-american-crime-story" target="_self">Courtney B.

While the series began on NBC like the others, it transitioned to USA Network after Season 6.</p><h3>Where to stream every season</h3><p>Despite the network change mid-series, all 10 seasons of <em>Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</em> are available in one place.

<p>Peacock plans start at just $5.99 with ads and $11.99 without ads. However, you can save 17% (or more &mdash;&nbsp;see below) by signing up for an annual subscription instead.</p><h2>How to watch<em> Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime</em></h2><p>Essentially a spinoff of a spinoff, <em>Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime</em> debuted in April 2021, making it the newest addition to the franchise. It stars Christopher Meloni as Detective Elliot Stabler, a former (and beloved) <em>SVU</em> member and Benson's ex-partner. Meloni left <em>SVU</em> ahead of Season 13, but as a fan favorite, returned with his own spinoff series years later. The series follows the Organized Crime<em> </em>Control Bureau as they tackle New York City's most vicious criminal enterprises &mdash; from mob activity to drug rings to fake vaccines.</p><h3>How many seasons are there?</h3><p><em>Organized Crime</em> is currently in its fourth season and airs Thursdays on NBC at 10 p.m. ET. It's already been renewed for Season 5; however, unlike the previous seasons, it will be a <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/law-amp-order-organized-crime-moving-peacock-renewed-season-5-1235910434/" target="_blank">Peacock Original</a>.</p><h3>Where to stream every season</h3><p>All four seasons of<em> Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime</em> (including the current season) are available to stream on Peacock. And since Season 5 has been ordered to Peacock as well, it's a good time to subscribe to the streaming service.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Students who can prove their student status via SheerID can score Peacock Premium for just $1.99 per month for an entire year. That's less than a daily coffee purchase. Once your student status is verified, you'll get a unique promo code to secure the discount. Just remember the code can only be used once (so no sharing!).</p><h3>Best Peacock deal for first responders</h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Similar to the student offer, first responders can take advantage of a special $1.99 per month offer so long as they can verify their first responder status via SheerID. Just sign up using the unique promo code you receive to get the discount. If you continue to meet verification qualifications, you can renew the deal annually. You'll have to go through the process each time to receive a new promo code each year.

<p>When <em>The Hunger Games</em> first hit theaters in 2012, it was an immediate box office hit. It launched the acting career of Jennifer Lawrence and skyrocketed her to stardom. It explored themes of rebellion, sacrifice, and the fight for freedom that made our teen and tween brains work overtime. And while a great deal has changed since the initial film release, "it's a franchise that grows with you and gets richer with time," as Mashable's Elena Cavender <a href="https://mashable.com/article/hunger-games-resurgence-tiktok" target="_self">pointed out</a>.</p><p>Last year, a new <em>Hunger Games</em> film hit the box office, giving us all a chance to revisit the film franchise and the books that created it. Based on a 2020 book of the same name, <em>The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snake</em>s premiered in theaters in November 2023. It <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt10545296/" target="_blank">earned</a> about $338 million worldwide and was met with largely <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-hunger-games-the-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes-review" target="_self">positive reviews</a>. Mashable's own Belen Edwards called it "well worth the wait."</p><p>Whether you want to catch up on the franchise, relive the excitement, or dive in for the very first time, we've broken down everything you need to know to watch all of the <em>The Hunger Games </em>movies online in 2024. But first, check out a <a href="https://mashable.com/video/the-hunger-games-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes-trailer" target="_self">preview of the newest film</a>, due to start streaming on May 14.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<h2>How many <em>Hunger Games</em> books and films are there?</h2><p>There are a total of four books in the <em>Hunger Games</em> saga: <em>The Hunger Game</em>s, <em>Catching Fire</em>, <em>Mockingjay</em>, and <em>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em>. When the books were adapted for film, Director Francis Lawrence split <em>Mockingjay</em> into two films, which he now <a href="https://people.com/hunger-games-director-regrets-splitting-mockingjay-two-parts-exclusive-8356372" target="_blank">regrets</a>, making a total of five films instead of four.</p><p>"In truth, we got more on the screen out of the book than we would've in any of the other movies because you're getting close to four hours of screen time for the final book. But, I see and understand how it frustrated people," Lawrence told <em>People</em>, regarding the splitting up of <em>Mockingjay</em>.</p><h2>Is <em>The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em> streaming?</h2><p>The <em>Hunger Games</em> prequel film, <em>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em> opened nationwide in theaters back in November. As of May 14, it will be available to stream at home exclusively on Starz. It's also available now at digital on-demand retailers (like <a href="https://zdcs.link/eBmx2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=02jKumyH2EaKMSb1FycvrDW&short_url=eBmx2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Prime Video</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/XDAqy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Fandango%20at%20Home&object_type=article&object_uuid=02jKumyH2EaKMSb1FycvrDW&short_url=XDAqy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Fandango at Home</a>) for rent or purchase. </p><h2>How to watch and read every <em>Hunger Games</em></h2><p>The <em>Hunger Games</em> films <a href="https://whatsondisneyplus.com/whats-leaving-hulu-in-july-2023/" target="_blank">left Hulu in July 2023</a>, but have found a temporary new streaming home in Netflix.

It can feel like the <em>Hunger Games</em>, and the odds have been stacked against us.</p><p>Terms like "Boysober" (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/style/boysober-celibacy-hope-woodward.html" target="_blank">dubbed</a> "this year's hottest mental health craze") and "benching" have become common in the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dating-app-terms-glossary" target="_self">dating lexicon</a>, and many people are beginning to lose hope.

<p>We're not going to ignore the elephant in the room and say that human connection can be replaced by swiping through profiles on a dating app. But we're not giving up hope just yet. </p><p>According to a survey by the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/02/08/for-valentines-day-facts-about-marriage-and-dating-in-the-us/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center</a>, nearly 44 percent of adults say they use dating apps to find a long-term partner rather than just casual dating or <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps" target="_self">hookups</a>. This survey also found that one in 10 partnered adults met their current partner through a dating app. So, even if you've yet to find that magical, swoon-worthy connection, the statistics show that it's definitely possible. Some of our own writers and editors have found love on the apps, too.</p><h2>Which dating app is best for serious relationships?</h2><p>There are <em>so many</em> dating apps, but not all of them are created equal when it comes to finding a serious, long-term relationship.</p><p>Some dating apps are better suited for casual flings or hookups (e.g., Tinder, Grindr, AdultFriendFinder, etc.), while others have matching algorithms and profile features specifically designed to help users find meaningful connections (e.g., eharmony, OkCupid, Hinge, and Coffee Meets Bagel).</p><p>The good news is that we've done the research (and hands-on testing) to figure out which apps work best for long-term committed relationships, and Match Group isn't the only player in the game. Plus, all of these platforms are available via Google Play and the App Store, so having an Android or iPhone won't limit your options. Some of the old-school dating sites still maintain a desktop version as well. </p><p>To find your match, here are the best dating apps for serious relationships in 2024:</p>]]></content:encoded>

The fan-adored drag queen has twice won <a href="https://mashable.com/article/rupauls-drag-race-season-15-shorter-episodes" target="_self"><em>RuPaul&rsquo;s Drag Race</em></a>, taking home the crown on both Season 5 and <em>All-Stars </em>Season 7.

In an interview with Mashable, she said, "It's really incredible. As a <a href="https://mashable.com/category/doctor-who" target="_self"><em>Doctor Who</em></a><em> </em>fan myself &mdash;&nbsp;and as a big fan of the David Tennant seasons &mdash;&nbsp;the fact that 'timey-wimey' was written into my dialogue felt like a special gift from [Season 14 showrunner] Russell [T Davies].

<p>In<a href="https://mashable.com/article/doctor-who-devils-chord-questions" target="_self"> "The Devil&rsquo;s Chord," </a>the Fifteenth Doctor (<a href="https://mashable.com/video/doctor-who-choose-your-squad" target="_self">Ncuti Gatwa</a>) and Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson) face off against Monsoon's Maestro in 1960s England, just as the Beatles are primed to record their debut album. But amid their battles over music and the very future of mankind, the Maestro (who uses they/them pronouns) drops all kinds of tantalizing teasers about their origins. Child of the Toymaker from the <em>Doctor Who </em>special <a href="https://mashable.com/article/doctor-who-giggle" target="_self">"The Giggle,"</a> the Maestro declares themselves part of the Pantheon, noting, "There are vast powers beyond the universe." Then, before being trapped in a piano (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/doctor-who-devils-chord-questions" target="_self">but not just any piano!)</a>, the Maestro cackles a warning: "The One Who Waits is almost here!"&nbsp;</p><p>What does all this mean? More specifically, how much did Davies reveal to Monsoon about what this foe's cryptic lines refer to? "Just what's pertinent," Monsoon explained over a Zoom interview. "I can tell you, from the experience I have working on sci-fi, nothing has ever been so close-lipped and secretive. And I <em>love</em> that. It's a special challenge as an actor to only have little bits." </p><div class="content-block-mashable-video mt-8">
    <div id="mashable-video-container-06oUNDu5Q2b2hxYgGETcJ4i"></div>
</div>
<p>But even if Monsoon can't spill the tea on the Maestro's mysterious proclamations, she had plenty of clues to pull from to create the character. "Luckily, Russell's an incredible writer, and everything you need is in the text,&rdquo; she said, adding that the Maestro&rsquo;s origins &mdash;&nbsp; which tap into&nbsp;Greek mythology and Lovecraftian horror &mdash;&nbsp;gave her plenty to work with.</p><q>
     The door is open for me and for other drag entertainers and trans entertainers and visibly queer people to come in and start claiming our space in front of the camera and onstage.
    </q>
<p>"I had tropes that I could draw from for inspiration. But essentially, as an actor, <em>if you're worth your salt,</em>" she emphasized by affecting a salty dame voice, "You should be able to just get everything you need from the script and infer enough to perform effectively."</p><p>And boy, does she. Within "The Devil&rsquo;s Chord," Monsoon unleashes a performance that proves her a force of nature. As an <a href="https://mashable.com/video/doctor-who-jinkx-monsoon-michelle-gomez" target="_self">influence in audacious villainy</a>, she cited <a href="https://mashable.com/article/doom-patrol-madam-rouge" target="_self">Michelle Gomez</a>, whose thrillingly menacing Missy rattled the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi) from 2014-2017. Then, she celebrated the current cast and crew. "It was just so exciting to work with people who were so <em>game</em> to try so much," Monsoon said, referring to the experimentation that went into choreographing the final music battle. "They do take after take because they too wanted to do it the best they possibly could."&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Jinkx Monsoon looks back on her path from <em>Drag Race </em>to <em>Doctor Who.</em></strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Reflecting on her work on <em>Doctor Who, </em>Monsoon mused, "When you're working at a certain level, the likelihood that everyone there is there because they want to be &mdash;&nbsp;and there because they're <em>passionate</em> about this&nbsp;&mdash; is much higher. And when you're in a room full of people who have all set their egos aside to put on the best show possible? I'm experiencing that right now in <em>Little Shop.</em> I experienced it with <em>Chicago</em> and <em>Doctor Who</em>. It is such an honor as a performer to get to work with other people who just really love what they do and want to do it to the best of their ability."</p><p>Monsoon has come a long way since the days of muttering the mantra <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLmWUAHrZnM" target="_blank">"Water off a duck&rsquo;s back" </a>while buffering the bullying of <em>Drag Race </em>contenders. Notably, she and <em>Drag Race </em>Season 5 rival Roxxxy Andrews recently "squashed" their beef with a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thejinkx/reel/C6yuF8tuQPU/?hl=en" target="_blank">meme-centric Instagram post</a>. So, with so many crowns won and mountains climbed, what's next for Jinkx Monsoon?</p><p>"I feel like I can go anywhere now," she said. "Like, I used to feel so limited, because drag was my chosen medium. You know, when I was in acting school, I thought I had to give up drag to be an effective working actor. And that just didn't end up being true for me. Because <em>immediately</em> after college, I was playing female roles in theater."</p><p>The transfeminine actor, who publicly came out as trans in 2017, continued, "Some directors just always saw me in me, even before I saw me in me &mdash; you know what I mean?... So, I said to myself, 'You don't have to give up drag to be an actor; you can marry the two.'"</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Monsoon admitted, "It's been a <em>long</em> journey to do that to the level I've gotten to do it recently. But every step along the way has been fulfilling." A highlight of which she's particularly proud is <em>The Jinkx and DeLa Holiday Special</em>. "I was putting really good work into that as an actor, as a writer, as a creator, as a performer," she explained. "That [pride is] what gave me the mojo that I'm now taking into everything. There's something about creating my <em>own</em> thing that made me feel like no matter what happens in my career, this is something I'm really proud of. And this feels like it's met the goals I wanted to meet as a performer. So it was almost like going into <em>All Stars</em>; I had nothing to lose, because I had everything I had worked towards already."</p><p>Since <em>All-Stars, </em>Monsoon counts herself lucky to be offered roles that have "all been a perfect fit," referring to Mama Morton, Audrey, and the Maestro. "I feel like the door is open for me and for other drag entertainers and trans entertainers and visibly queer people to come in and start claiming our space in front of the camera and onstage," Monsoon declared. "We've always been here. We've always been a part of the entertainment community. We've just not been able to be as vocal and as honest as we're getting to be now.</p><p>"And honestly," Monsoon said with a smile, "I think with every swing the <a href="https://mashable.com/video/john-oliver-transgender-rights-last-week-tonight" target="_self">conservative right takes at us</a>, entertainment goes, 'You know what, we see you, and we raise you the queerest season of <em>Doctor Who</em> you've ever seen!' And really, it's just gonna be incredible. I'm so excited for people to see it. It's such an amazing show. And this new iteration of it is just like, fresh and exciting and so full of potential and possibilities."</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/BdMgB?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Doctor%20Who%20streams%20Friday%2C%20May%2010%20at%207%3A00%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20Disney%2B%2C%20where%20available%2C&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03lETsg5XHmN85XNZjbWuqi&amp%3Bshort_url=BdMgB&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fdoctor-who-space-babies-devils-chord&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Doctor%20Who%20streams%20Friday%2C%20May%2010%20at%207%3A00%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20Disney%2B%2C%20where%20available%2C&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uuhS05XkXKYcke1rdMba9&short_url=BdMgB&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em> streams Friday, May 10 at 7:00 p.m. ET on Disney+, where available,</a> and simultaneously on May 11 at midnight on BBC iPlayer in the UK.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for May 11's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><h2><strong>Here's a hint for today's <em>Connections</em> categories</strong></h2><p>Want a hit about the categories without being told the categories?

<p>The TARDIS, a time-traveling spaceship that is bigger on the inside, has a wardrobe room to help its inhabitants dress up in the style of whatever era they happen to be visiting. We heard its location described in "The Unquiet Dead" (Season 1, episode 3), when Rose (Billie Piper) needed a dress for 1860; it was in the same place in "Thin Ice" (Season 10, episode 3), when Bill Potts (Pearl Mackie) had to dress for 1814. </p><p>The wardrobe also helps the Doctor decide how he's going to dress in each incarnation. Gatwa's Fifteenth Doctor appears to be going for a novel strategy: Wear different clothes, but perfectly fabulous ones, on each outing. And wigs too, apparently, mentioned and shown off here for the first time. (Technically, Matt Smith was wearing a wig for his final outing as the Doctor in 2013, but that's because he was filming <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/cult/a514625/matt-smith-wears-wig-on-set-of-doctor-who-special-pictures/" target="_blank">Ryan Gosling's directorial debut <em>Lost River</em></a> at the same time. This is the Doctor's first canonical wig.) </p><p>As for the music that accompanies the Doctor and Ruby as they strut out of the TARDIS and into 1963 London? Incongruously, that's "California Soul," a 1967 hit by married songwriters Ashford &amp; Simpson. If you follow tech news, you might remember it from Apple's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-13-california-streaming" target="_self">California-themed iPhone 13 launch in 2021</a>.</p><h2><strong>This was the Beatles' big day.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Monday, February 11, 1963 was the day the Beatles went to EMI Studios and changed music history forever. (As the Doctor correctly points out, it was not yet called Abbey Road.) What they're supposed to be recording  &mdash; with the help of George Martin, whom we see in the control room &mdash; is their seminal first album, <em>Please Please Me</em>. </p><p>No, it did not contain any songs about dogs;&nbsp;that's the doing of a new and dastardly foe. The "loss of music" plot is a clever way for the show to get around using actual Beatles music, which is notoriously expensive to license. For example, <em>Mad Men</em> showrunner Matthew Weiner <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/mad-men-paid-250k-for-beatles-song-179470/" target="_blank">spent $250,000</a> for a single play of a single track from <em>Revolver</em>. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            'The Beatles: Get Back' is a profile of the greatest band ever, as you've never seen them before

<p>But back to the real-life music and <em>Please Please Me</em>. This immortal 14-track LP was recorded in three sessions on a single day. The Beatles were worn out from touring, as they'd just been doing shows at Sunderland in the northeast of England two days earlier, but they still gave it their all. </p><p>John Lennon in particular was not in good shape, nursing a cold. The incredible power of his voice on the final track, "Twist and Shout," comes from the fact that you can hear his vulnerable vocal chords literally being torn apart. He lost his voice for much of the next week. </p><h2><strong>RIP Cilla Black.</strong></h2><p>Dismayed by the lack of talent in the Beatles, the Doctor and Ruby run to the next studio, where they find British singing superstar Cilla Black (played by Liverpudlian actor Josie Sedgwick-Davies). "Don't let me down, Cilla," the Doctor mutters. Cilla's lackluster performance confirms that something is very wrong in the realm of music. </p><p>Admittedly, the timeline is a little off here. Cilla Black, who spent the latter part of her career as a beloved TV host and died in 2015, was a friend of the Beatles from the old days in Liverpool; they sang together on occasion. She did sign with their manager, Brian Epstein, but not until <em>September</em> 1963. She released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNYPHz8pYs0" target="_blank">"Love of the Loved"</a> (which Lennon and McCartney gave her) the following month, and soared to the top the charts by 1964. </p><h2><strong>The Doctor talks about his granddaughter Susan.</strong></h2><p>If you're an old-school <em>Doctor Who</em> fan, you were probably pointing at the screen like that Leonardo DiCaprio meme during the scene on the rooftop with the Doctor and Ruby. <em>He said Totter's Lane!</em> (That's the location of the junkyard where we first met the Doctor, played by William Hartnell in 1963). But more importantly: He said Susan! (He also said she might be dead because of the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/doctor-who-space-babies-questions" target="_self">Master's genocide of the Time Lords</a>, which apparently rippled out through space and time, so... swings and roundabouts.) </p><p>Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford), as she was initially known, was introduced as the Doctor's granddaughter in that first episode on November 22, 1963. But Ford soon grew frustrated with her moody, otherworldly teenage character, who tended to have little agency. She left the show in 1964. Other than returning with a Hartnell lookalike for brief scenes in the 20th anniversary special "The Five Doctors," she has not been seen and has barely been mentioned in the show since. </p><p>We also don't know anything about Susan's parents; indeed, <em>Doctor Who </em>subsequently seemed embarrassed by the initial suggestion that its mysterious lead once had at least one kid and one grandkid. But given the season arc about the search for Ruby's parents, it seems Davies might take the opportunity to clear up the Doctor's family situation. Carole Ann Ford is still alive, and she seems <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/sci-fi/doctor-who-susan-return-exclusive-newsupdate/" target="_blank">willing to participate</a>. Might we see Susan one more time? </p><h2><strong>Breaking the fourth wall: The Maestro and the Doctor winked at us.</strong></h2><p>At the end of Gatwa's Christmas special, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/doctor-who-disney-plus-christmas-special-trailer-easter-eggs" target="_self">"The Church on Ruby Road,"</a> a character named Mrs. Flood (Anita Dobson) talks directly to the audience. "Never seen a TARDIS before?" she winks. </p><p>Well, it seems Mrs. Flood's cheekiness wasn't a one-off. In "The Devil's Chord," the Maestro clearly and specifically winks at the audience too &mdash; right before attacking the old woman who dared play Debussy's "Clair de lune" on her piano. The Doctor also winks, right before the final song number. Does that mean Mrs. Flood, the Maestro, <em>and </em>the Doctor are all members of this still-mysterious "Pantheon" of god-like beings? </p><h2><strong>"Pyramids of Mars" is revisited.</strong></h2><p>When Ruby insists that the Maestro can't win &mdash;&nbsp;because Ruby herself is from the future and knows everything turns out alright &mdash; she's making a classic Doctor Who companion mistake. </p><p>Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen), beloved companion of the Third and Fourth Doctors, famously made that same error regarding a superhuman villain in 1975's "Pyramids of Mars," a fan favorite episode set in 1911.</p><p>And when the Doctor snaps Ruby out of her complacency by taking her to post-apocalyptic London in 2024, explaining that this is the future if the Maestro wins, he's doing exactly what Tom Baker's Doctor did in that classic serial. Although <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Syt3twu3SlI" target="_blank">as you can see</a>, the show had a slightly lower budget at the time.</p><h2><strong>The Mrs. Mills piano is real.</strong></h2><p>In his battle with the Maestro, the Doctor uses a famous old EMI piano that's supposedly thrumming with musical energy. This specially customized Steinway Vertegrand, which had been in the studio since the 1930s, was known as <a href="https://www.abbeyroad.com/news/steinway-vertegrand-gearthatmadeus-3165" target="_blank">the Mrs. Mills piano;</a> it was named after popular music hall pianist Gladys Mills, who often appeared on the BBC. The Beatles used it on "Penny Lane" and "With a Little Help from My Friends." </p><p>And if you want to hear what it sounds like to play the Mrs. Mills piano, <a href="https://www.abbeyroad.com/news/introducing-the-originals-mrs-mills-piano-from-abbey-road-studios-spitfire-audio-2944" target="_blank">Abbey Road studios is pleased to sell you a software version</a>, endorsed by Sir Paul McCartney itself.  </p><h2><strong>The Beatles' magic chord isn't what you think.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In the finale of the episode, that Mrs. Mills piano is sent flying from the midst of the Maestro's music battle. This flings the iconic instrument away from the Doctor, who was trying to capture the Maestro by playing a specific chord. But the day is saved when the tune is completed by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who read the floating notes and unleash their latent musical energy at last. (The Beatles famously never learned to read sheet music, but we'll allow it.) </p><p>But what <em>is</em> that chord? You might sense a reference to the end of the Beatles' most highly regarded song, "A Day in the Life," from the end of their 1967 album <em>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>. However, that famous chord &mdash; played on four pianos at once, with microphones moving in to catch the echoes so the fade-out seems to last forever &mdash; was an E major, a powerful chord often used in rock tunes. </p><p>Best we can tell, thanks to sound-detecting <a href="https://mashable.com/category/artificial-intelligence" target="_self">AI</a> apps, is that <em>Doctor Who </em>uses a C major in that scene. (The chord appears to have nothing to do with the respective positions of Lennon and McCartney's hands on the keyboard, which seem random.) </p><p>That leaves us wondering. Was Davies too worried about lawyers for the Beatles label Apple Corps to give us an E? Is that chord, in the context of an ending provided by the Beatles, effectively copyrighted now? Does its association with "A Day in the Life" make E the truly terrifying devil's chord here?</p><h2><strong>What's the "twist at the end"?</strong> </h2><p>The unusual closing number, "Always a Twist at the End," is essentially a dad joke based on the popular 1960s dance move, as well as a reference to the Beatles' hit song, "Twist and Shout." It also seems designed to needle <em>Doctor Who </em>fans who take the show too seriously. </p><p>Heads will explode as hardcore fans try to answer the question: Did that song <em>really</em> happen? Was there some residual energy from the defeat of the Maestro that made everyone in their vicinity do a dance number, perhaps in the style of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>'s musical episode, "Once More, with Feeling"? </p><p>Regardless, the obvious twist is introduced at the end of the song: the re-emergence of the young boy, Henry Arbinger, which is likely a sign that the Maestro is not as defeated as you might think. </p><p>But there's also a literal twist hiding in the dance scene: Susan Twist. The actor also showed up in "The Church on Ruby Road" as the woman in the pub asking Ruby to play her favorite seasonal song, and in 2023's "Wild Blue Yonder" as Isaac Newton's maid. </p><p>Davies has hinted she's important to the show's future, so... expect yet more Twist(s) before the end. </p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/BdMgB?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Doctor%20Who%20streams%20Friday%2C%20May%2010%20at%207%3A00%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20Disney%2B%2C%20where%20available%2C&object_type=article&object_uuid=039IuJeKc3oJYHTonHPU13k&short_url=BdMgB&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em> streams Friday, May 10 at 7:00 p.m. ET on Disney+, where available,</a> and simultaneously on May 11 at midnight on BBC iPlayer in the UK.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA['Doctor Who' starring Ncuti Gatwa is about to take us to the Beatles. 'Doctor Who' starring William Hartnell already took us there]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/006bJnFcWA1SuJURDftZX5F/hero-image.png" alt="The real Beatles in 1965, and the Doctor in 'The Devil's Chord.'"><p>When that most seasoned of time-travelers, the Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa), returns to our screens Friday, he'll be making what he says is his first visit to the Beatles.&nbsp;</p><p>In the second episode of the new season of <em>Doctor Who</em>, "The Devil's Chord," TARDIS co-habitant Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson) declares she's always wanted to see the band, so an excited Doctor whisks her away to 11 February 1963 when the Fab Four recorded their first album, <em>Please Please Me</em>, in a single day.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, Ncuti's Doctor is technically correct (and right to be surprised!) that his previous incarnations have never been to see the Beatles. Neil Gaiman intended otherwise: he wrote a scene where Matt Smith's Doctor and Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) see the group's famous Shea Stadium performance at the opening of his 2011 episode "The Doctor's Wife," but that never made it to screen.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet the Beatles &mdash; the real ones, not the barely-lookalike versions seen in "The Devil's Chord" &mdash; did perform on <em>Doctor Who</em> once before, almost appearing as their future selves. </p><p>The biggest band in the world and the longest-running drama in the world both arrived on the scene in 1963, and have had a long-and-winding, timey-wimey history together ever since.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The Beatles 50th Anniversary concert &hellip; in 1965?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Two years into their magical mystery tours, the Beatles and the world of 'Doctor Who' collided multiple times.&nbsp;</p><p>One of these collisions was in person, and it took place at the Cannes film festival in May 1965. A lone Dalek (one of a squadron in France to promote the Peter Cushing movie <em>Dr. Who and the Daleks</em>) was photographed running into John Lennon and this then-wife Cynthia at breakfast. The Lennons, there to promote the band's surreal second movie, <em>Help!</em>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beatles/comments/nrafy6/john_being_approached_by_a_dalek_at_the_1965/" target="_blank">looked nonplussed</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That same month, the BBC started screening another Dalek serial on <em>Doctor Who</em>, "The Chase." Over six episodes, in a madcap escape across time and space, the first Doctor (William Hartnell) and his companions fled the evil pepper pots that menaced the Lennons.&nbsp;</p><p>But first, they relaxed with a goofy, never-to-be-seen-again Time and Space Visualizer (taken from the previous serial's "Space Museum). After tuning in to Shakespeare and Abraham Lincoln, the TARDIS team rock out with some embarrassing dancing to ... a performance by the Beatles of their latest chart hit.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Less than a minute into "Ticket to Ride," as the Doctor and schoolteacher Ian (William Russell) are bopping away like awkward dads, schoolteacher Barbara (Jacqueline Hill) accidentally turns the performance off. "You've squashed my favorite beetles," jokes the Doctor. </p><p>Vicki (Maureen O'Brien), a British space colonist from the far future, then tells her aghast friends from the 1960s that the Beatles are considered classical music in her time.&nbsp;"I've been to their memorial theater in Liverpool," says O'Brien &mdash; who was from Liverpool herself. (There is no Beatles Memorial Theater in Liverpool yet, though even O'Brien might have been shocked to learn about John Lennon International Airport.) </p><p>What the BBC producers had proposed, according to the seminal <em>Doctor Who: The Complete History</em>, was even wilder: the live performance would pose as footage from a Beatles "50th anniversary" concert, presumably in the 2010s. Playing their older selves, the band would wear long gray beards. </p><p>One could imagine the four jokesters &mdash; <em>Goon Show </em>lovers who had already appeared on many UK TV comedy shows &mdash; really getting into the idea. Indeed, they would do something very similar in animated form three years later, during the "When I'm Sixty Four" segment of <em>Yellow Submarine.&nbsp;</em></p><div class="raw-embed">

<p>But the band's manager, Brian Epstein, turned the <em>Doctor Who</em> team down: he felt it would be bad for his boys' image. Instead of inventing elder mop tops, then, the show simply grabbed a Beatles performance that the group had filmed the previous month, in <em>Doctor Who</em>'s regular studio, for another BBC show &mdash; <em>Top of the Pops.&nbsp;</em>Epstein consented to a very short clip being used, hence Barbara's accident with the off switch. </p><p>In a final timey-wimey twist worthy of the Doctor, episode 1 of "The Chase" is now the only place you can see that particular Beatles performance since the BBC regularly wiped its <em>TotP</em> tapes.&nbsp;(Unfortunately, thanks to copyright issues, the segment isn't available in U.S. versions of "The Chase.") &nbsp;</p><p>Epstein's decision was a disappointment for the show. But it would turn out to be a tragedy for the band, which missed its only opportunity for a 50th anniversary concert. </p><p>Not only did the Fab Four quit the concert scene for good a year later, and quit each other in 1970, but two members of the band would be dead long before its 50th birthday.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Yesterday and today</strong></h2><p>By 1973, the Doctor seems to have quit following the group once described as "my favorite beetles." That was the year the second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) and the third (Jon Pertwee) met in the TARDIS, confusing companion Jo Grant (Katy Manning).&nbsp;</p><p>"It's all quite simple," Pertwee's Doctor says. "I am he and he is me."&nbsp;</p><p>"And we are all together," replies Jo, "goo goo g' joob?" But neither Doctor knows the song she's referencing. Did he, in common with a lot of old folks in the 1960s, quit listening to the Beatles around the <em>Revolver</em> album, when they got weird?&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>All we know is that by the time of the new show, the Doctor seems to have become a fan again. David Tennant's Doctor helps with a crucial security question on a sunbound spaceship in the 2007 episode "42" by correctly calculating whether the Beatles or Elvis have had more number 1 hits. </p><p>Matt Smith's Doctor, attempting to escape his fate in 2011's "The Wedding of River Song," muses about joining the Beatles.&nbsp;</p><p>And perhaps the Doctor still can, in his Ncuti Gatwa incarnation. </p><p>Judging by the way he handles a couple of the Beatles' instruments in "The Devil's Chord," providing inspiration to Lennon and McCartney in the process, the group could get by with a little help from its oldest fictional fan.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/BdMgB?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Doctor%20Who%20streams%20Friday%2C%20May%2010%20at%207%3A00%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20Disney%2B%2C%20where%20available%2C&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03lETsg5XHmN85XNZjbWuqi&amp%3Bshort_url=BdMgB&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fdoctor-who-space-babies-devils-chord&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Doctor%20Who%20streams%20Friday%2C%20May%2010%20at%207%3A00%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20Disney%2B%2C%20where%20available%2C&object_type=article&object_uuid=006bJnFcWA1SuJURDftZX5F&short_url=BdMgB&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em> streams Friday, May 10 at 7:00 p.m. ET on Disney+, where available,</a> and simultaneously on May 11 at midnight on BBC iPlayer in the UK.</p>]]></content:encoded>

With the arrival of <em>Doctor Who's</em> fourteenth season on <a href="https://mashable.com/category/disney-plus" target="_self">Disney+,</a> the long-running sci-fi series is welcoming a new generation of fans to join a veritable legion of experienced Whovians.</p><p>Whether you've been a fan of the Doctor since the initial run, fell in with its 2005 revival, or have just started wading into all things "timey-wimey," returning showrunner and writer Russell T Davies is offering treasures with the premiere episode "Space Babies." </p><p>Along with a space-set fairy tale of monsters and derring-do, "Space Babies" delivers a bumper crop of references, questions answered, and other assorted Easter eggs. Here's what you might have missed.</p><h2><strong>Gallifrey is gone, babes. </strong></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-yjnUkuUurDc"></div>
</div>


<p>Gallifrey, home of the Time Lords, has spent the last 20 years bouncing in and out of existence on <em>Doctor Who</em>. In Davies' first era as showrunner (2005-2010), the planet had been wiped out in a mysterious Time War with the Doctor's main enemy, the Daleks. Wiped out, we were led to believe over seven seasons, by the Doctor himself. </p><p>That all led up to the <a href="https://mashable.com/archive/doctor-who-review-the-day-that-changed-everything" target="_self"><em>Doctor Who </em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/archive/doctor-who-review-the-day-that-changed-everything" target="_self">50th anniversary</a>, in which the loss of Gallifrey was expertly retconned by then-showrunner Steven Moffat. The Doctor made his way back home over two seasons as Peter Capaldi's Twelfth Doctor, finally sending big bad president Rassilon packing in "Hell Bent" (Season 9, episode 12)."</p><p>Then, in Jodie Whittaker's Thirteenth Doctor era, controversial showrunner Chris Chibnall told us Gallifrey had been destroyed again. This time, it was because the Doctor's ultimate frenemy, the Master, found out that all Time Lords including himself had the Doctor's DNA in them as part of the so-called <a href="https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Timeless_Child" target="_blank">Timeless Child</a> reveal and... had a fit of rage sufficient to destroy an entire people in some way? It was never quite clear. </p><p>Now with "Space Babies," Davies confirms that the Doctor's world of Gallifrey is "gone." Gatwa's Fifteenth Doctor says it twice, in two registers, in one of the episode's most affecting line readings. The Doctor's recurring search for home is no more. As in Davies' first tenure, the lead character is the last of the Time Lords. </p><p>What Davies appears to be signaling is that he's not going to retcon Gallifrey back again; the Chibnall genocide (which is here explicitly called a genocide for the first time) was for real. And really, in story terms, the call is a no-brainer. The Doctor is better off without those pompous big-collared elites cramping his new sense of style. </p><h2><strong>"Space Babies" tackles the butterfly effect. (No, not <em>that</em> butterfly effect.)</strong></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-CHGW3PlUKMY"></div>
</div>


<p>At the start of "Space Babies," Ruby Sunday gets firsthand experience on how a little change in the past can radically alter the future. When visiting the dinosaurs of long ago, she accidentally crushes a butterfly&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and just like that becomes an ornery reptilian hatchling. (Good thing the Doctor's quick thinking resuscitates the fallen bug and sets things right!) </p><p>Beyond setting up some basic rules of time travel in <em>Doctor Who, </em>this simple scene of Ruby stepping on a butterfly has an older lineage than you might think &mdash; even older than <em>Doctor Who</em> itself. </p><p>The 1952 Ray Bradbury story "<a href="https://www.astro.sunysb.edu/fwalter/AST389/ASoundofThunder.pdf" target="_blank">A Sound of Thunder</a>" features a time-travel safari skipping back 65 million years in order to hunt for T. rex. The hunters are constantly told not to change anything in the past lest they change their present, and they think they've heeded the warnings &mdash; until one discovers a dead butterfly on the sole of his shoe. That changes something crucial in their own time: a fascist candidate for president, who'd lost when they left, now appears to have won. </p><p>That's the don't-step-on-a-butterfly rule of time travel reflected in <em>Doctor Who,</em> which is not to be confused with "the butterfly effect," which boils down to the "butterfly flaps its wings and causes a hurricane around the world." Though the two are often conflated, the latter has more to do with chaotic patterns resulting from tiny changes in large systems like, say, the global weather, than it does with the theoretical realm of time travel.  </p><p>Whatever you call it, <em>Doctor Who </em>has had some fun with the "don't step on a butterfly" rule over the years. "Tell you what then, don't step on any butterflies," David Tennant's Tenth Doctor tells Martha (Freema Agyeman) when she brings it up in "The Shakespeare Code" (Season 3, episode 2). "What have butterflies ever done to you?" </p><p>The butterfly chat goes in a different direction when Bill Potts (Pearl Mackie) brings it up to the Twelfth Doctor in "Thin Ice" (Season 10, episode 3). "I mean, that's what happened to Pete," the Doctor says, deadpan, making up a companion on the spot. "He was standing there a moment ago, but he stepped on a butterfly, and now you don't even remember him." </p><p>But when Ruby actually steps on a butterfly, it marks the first time the Doctor has seen the result in person &mdash; what he deserves for teasing Bill, perhaps. Luckily, he was able to revive the butterfly, but how? Regeneration energy? Can the Doctor bring creatures back to life now? It isn't clear. </p><h2><strong>Remember<em> WALL-E?</em> Meet Nan-E.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>If you saw the self-driving baby carriers in "Space Babies" and thought of the baby-like, helpless humans revealed to be in a space station at the end of the beloved Pixar movie, you're not the only one. </p><p>The homage is clear. And it becomes even clearer when we learn of the existence of Nan-E (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/bridgerton-queen-charlotte-fashion" target="_self"><em>Bridgerton'</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/bridgerton-queen-charlotte-fashion" target="_self">s Golda Rosheuvel</a>), a robotic voice with an anti-swearing filter, chosen as a pun on the traditional British "nanny." But this one turns out to be an isolated carer who's a bit more homicidal (or strictly speaking... booger-cidal?) than WALL-E the robot ever was. </p><h2><strong>The Bogeyman enters.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In the Peter Capaldi episode "Sleep No More" (Season 9, episode 9), the Doctor encounters a monster that is literally made out of sleep. Not the act of losing consciousness, but the stuff that gets in your eyes overnight, aka eye boogers.</p><p>Some fans thought that choice was the bottom of the barrel when it comes to <em>Doctor Who </em>monsters. But apparently there's a whole other barrel below it, and it contains nose mucus. Welcome to <em>Doctor Who </em>canon, bogeyman! (A TARDIS-style translation note: Bogeys in the UK are boogers in the U.S., and the UK bogeyman is the same as the U.S. boogeyman.) </p><p>Davies has all the juvenile linguistic fun you might expect, including Ruby's expression of disbelief: "It's not." It is, of course, <em>snot. </em></p><p>Appropriately enough for this episode, the old English name of the mythical creature used to scare children since time immemorial simply means "frightening specter." </p><h2><strong>What is the Doctor's real name?</strong></h2><p>An oldie but a goodie in <em>Doctor Who</em> is to<em> </em>tease the notion that the Doctor is about to reveal his actual secret Gallifreyan name. And no, his actual name is not "Who." Although former showrunner Steven Moffat likes to point out there are plenty of indicators throughout the classic series (1963-1989) and the revived series (since 2005) that the full title of the show is what the universe actually calls him.</p><p>Moffat's episode "The Name of the Doctor" (Season 7, episode 13) is the ultimate tease. Even with a title like that, it fails to reveal any name beyond the Doctor.<strong> </strong>"The name you choose, it's a promise," Matt Smith's Eleventh Doctor insists, and that's been good enough for fans ever since. </p><p>That doesn't mean Davies won't continue to tease it, as he does at the end of "Space Babies." In the premiere ep, he's about to tell Ruby Sunday and her family his real name as he closes the door of the TARDIS. But as in "The Name of the Doctor," our attention is distracted by something else. In this case, it's a TARDIS scan revealing that whatever Ruby Sunday is, she is actually human (and thus not a Time Lord.) </p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/BdMgB?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Doctor%20Who%20streams%20Friday%2C%20May%2010%20at%207%3A00%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20Disney%2B%2C%20where%20available%2C&object_type=article&object_uuid=050b8DIANqn9R5N7KLS0mSI&short_url=BdMgB&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em> streams Friday, May 10 at 7:00 p.m. ET on Disney+, where available,</a> and simultaneously on May 11 at midnight on BBC iPlayer in the UK.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to NOAA's <a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/basicwx/94fndfd.gif" target="_blank">current earth-weather forecasts</a>, among the states where NOAA's map of aurora viewing conditions says viewing is possible, weather conditions look favorable in:</p><ul><li><p>Washington </p></li><li><p>Oregon </p></li><li><p>Idaho </p></li><li><p>Montana </p></li><li><p>Wyoming </p></li><li><p>The Dakotas </p></li><li><p>Possibly Nebraska, </p></li><li><p>Minnesota</p></li><li><p>Wisconsin</p></li><li><p>Illinois</p></li><li><p>Iowa</p></li><li><p>Pretty much all of New England</p></li></ul><p>Weather conditions look less favorable in:</p><ul><li><p>The northernmost tip of Utah</p></li><li><p>Michigan</p></li><li><p>Ohio</p></li><li><p>Appalachian Pennsylvania</p></li><li><p>The panhandle of West Virginia</p></li><li><p>Upstate New York</p></li><li><p>...and Maine</p></li></ul><p>But never let the clouds stop you from at least glancing up in the hopes of seeing something good. Furthermore, this solar storm is a real rarity, so if you're a little further south, like in Northern California or Northern Missouri and you're hoping for a once-in-a-lifetime chance of seeing these lights in the lower latitudes, now is your chance to try.</p><h2>What are the northern lights anyway?</h2><p>The auroras (aurora borealis in the northern hemisphere, and aurora australis in the southern hemisphere) are the visual evidence of charged particles that flow toward us in what's known as the <em>solar wind</em> &mdash; in this case a "severe" solar storm &mdash; colliding with the particles in the Earth's magnetic field such as oxygen atoms. The glowing display itself is occurring not in space, but in Earth's upper atmosphere. </p><p>They will often look, at first, like a whitish glow hanging over the northern horizon, but with any luck they will then turn into technicolor, wobbling rays of light that can seem to waft or stretch. Most displays will contain green. Stronger storms will contain red shades, and blues, pinks, and purples are also possible.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There were reports about a ChatGPT search engine being launched on Monday, which was especially juicy since Google I/O is happening the very next day. Followers are also eagerly anticipating the release of GPT-5 which is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-gpt-5-release-this-summer" target="_self">rumored</a> to come out this summer and possibly sooner. However, a livestream event unrelated to a search engine or GPT-5 is unexpected. </p><p>Within minutes of Altman's confirmation that their announcement won't be about a search engine, Google stock shot up. So Google execs can breathe a sigh of relief... for now.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The genAI side of X is already abuzz with speculation. GPT-4.5? A Sora announcement? It's anybody's guess right now, but we're staying tuned. </p><p>The livestream will be on <a href="http://OpenAI.com" target="_blank">openai.com</a> on Monday, May 13 at 1pm ET/10 am PT. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Space Black on the MacBook Pro, on the other hand, features a "breakthrough chemistry" finish, as Apple calls it, that forms an anodization seal to keep pesky fingerprints at bay.

<p>And well, since then, you'd be hard-pressed to find a black MacBook. As such, I can't help but wonder if this is a brilliant marketing ploy where the Cupertino-based tech giant was playing the long game. </p><p>Black is prevalent among other laptop brands (e.g., Lenovo), but the scarcity of true black among MacBooks had "people losing their minds," as Inverse said, when Apple unveiled the Space Black MacBook Pro last year.</p><p>If Apple could make an even darker, richer color than Space Black &mdash; the blackest black to ever black in the history of black &mdash; I'd lose my mind, too.</p><h2><strong>There's now a 'Space Black' iPad &mdash; is this a sign?</strong></h2><p>Fortunately, it looks like Space Black won't be limited to the M3 Pro MacBook Pro. Apple unveiled the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ipad-pro-2024-first-impressions" target="_self">new iPad Pro</a> and I gasped when I heard that it comes in Space Black, starting with $999 for the 11-inch model and $1,299 for the 13-inch model.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Granted, the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-review" target="_self">iPhone 15 Pro models</a>, featuring a new titanium chassis, do come in "Titanium Black," but it's not the same.

      <description><![CDATA[Yes, the Kendrick Lamar vs. Drake beef has been vicious. But it has also been the perfect fodder for content creators to grow their reach, boost engagement, and make some cash.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04PcdGu3spR1C07pWh6RIgt/hero-image.png" alt="three images compiled together, drake rapping on left, center screenshot of man reacting to rap beef, right is kendrick lamar rapping"><p>Cultural events in the digital age take a familiar shape. There is the central story &mdash; in this case, the truly vicious beef between rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake &mdash; and then a whole array of tendrils stemming from that core event. The main thing feeds, for better or worse, a content ecosystem.</p><p>The Kendrick vs. Drake fracas has birthed a cottage industry of reactions online. Sure, the beef is ruthless. Families <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/drake-kendrick-lamar-new-disses-family-matters-meet-the-grahams.html" target="_blank">are involved</a>, alleged secrets are out, potential <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMFcHkGLMBg" target="_blank">false flag operations</a> are at play, and serious criminal allegations have been levied. There have also been <em>countless </em>avenues for creators to get involved, if not necessarily directly engaging with the nastier bits of the beef. There are lyrics to parse through and disses that inspire significant<em> </em>reactions to the various new tracks dropping.</p><p>In short, even something like the Drake vs. Kendrick beef &mdash; honestly, <em>especially </em>something like the beef &mdash; is an opportunity for creators to grow their reach. It's a natural fit for some because they're <em>already </em>talking about it. </p><p>"I try to keep up with anything that goes down in music," <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jordanxbowles?lang=en" target="_blank">Jordan Bowles</a>, a 21-year-old creator in Indiana, told Mashable. "The first time I talked specifically about Kendrick and Drake, the beef, I called it over after 'Euphoria' came out." </p><p>The video immediately found its audience, shooting up to nearly 20,000 views. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">
        <span class="font-bold text-primary-400">SEE ALSO:</span>
        <a href="https://mashable.com/article/drake-meme-for-all-the-dogs" class="text-secondary-300">
            Is Drake really the master of his own memes?
            <svg class="inline-block ml-1 w-4 h-4 font-normal fill-current"><use href="https://mashable.com/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin"></use></svg>
        </a>
    </div>
<p>But the battle was far from over, as we all know. Bowles is the kind of TikTok creator you'd expect to jump into the beef. Scroll through his profile, and you'll find many posts about hip-hop, pop culture, and other little life observations you'd typically see on the platform. </p><p>Not to fully relitigate the battles between Kendrick and Drake, but there have been <em>many</em> back-and-forth allegations &mdash; some serious and, importantly, unproven. Drake levied an allegation of domestic abuse, and Lamar came back with, well, a lot, including accusations of pedophilia. Many outlets <a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/05/07/drake-kendrick-lamar-beef-timeline/" target="_blank">have done</a> <a href="https://time.com/6975027/kendrick-lamar-drake-beef-explained-timeline/" target="_blank">an excellent job</a> breaking down the beef timeline. The consensus seems that Lamar "won" the battle via the back-to-back offerings of "Meet the Grahams" and "Not Like Us," <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/kendrick-lamar-drake-not-like-us-euphoria-hot-100-number-one-1235677321/" target="_blank">which shot to the top of streaming charts</a>.</p><p>The fight still rages online, even though Kendrick and Drake have reached a standstill. Bowles posted regularly as the tracks dropped, typically writing his thoughts in captions over a video of him listening to the song. Like many others, he felt Kendrick was winning the battle. He did a simple video about "Meet the Grahams," noting that Drake should've never brought up the family because he couldn't keep up with Kendrick's response. It's racked up 4 million views, by far Bowles' most-watched TikTok ever. It's <em>quite </em>the number for a creator who just now climbed above 18,000 followers. </p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7364999498898214187" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">
    <section></section>
</blockquote>

<p>It was a big moment for Bowles, who is trying to carve out a lane as a creator. </p><p>"My phone's going off, view after view after view. I'm checking every 10 seconds because I'm excited," he said. </p><p>Some of his other videos on the feud have racked up anywhere from 60,000 to 900,000 views, which are <em>all </em>big numbers for a micro-content creator. His account also saw a roughly 12 percent jump in followers after he started talking about the beef. </p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7359658429507702062" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">
    <section></section>
</blockquote>

<p>However, someone like Bowles is relatively tiny compared to other creators. A handful of already-popular personalities have focused on the Drake vs. Kendrick saga. Already a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/kai-cenat-ps5-giveaway-union-square-nyc-fans" target="_self">popular and controversial</a> influencer, Kai Cenat has racked up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVelBKQvzx4" target="_blank">millions of views</a> and, one assumes, a good amount of cash covering the beef. There are also creators like rapper <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCideLO7JJw2poa1JrEmQKDQ" target="_blank">Scru Face Jean</a>, who was already somewhat popular but, like Bowles, has seen his numbers grow from focusing on the beef. The most viewed <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@therealscrufacejean?lang=en" target="_blank">TikToks on his page</a>, some floating around a million views, are all about Kendrick vs. Drake, while his music and other hip-hop reactions show way less engagement. </p><p>That's the thing, though. The creators who are seemingly capitalizing on the beef had to have earned it. They were <em>already </em>focused on the hip-hop space when this huge moment came around. </p><p>"I value my take and feelings in the whole thing," Bowles said. If people knew you were into hip-hop, your thoughts might break through. For instance, Bowles said he tried to have exciting and opinionated reactions. </p><p>"Every diss that has come out, I've listened to it three, four, five times before I wrote down some thoughts," he said. "And after I pulled myself together, I texted a few people to get different sides of how they feel about it. I would then piece together my thoughts."</p><p>Then he'd post a summary of those thoughts via text over a video of him reacting. </p><p>"It was a good recipe," Bowles said. </p><p>These moments can be big business for creators &mdash; even if, again, we're talking about a vicious verbal fight that some are concerned has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/drake-shooting-toronto-mansion-03741edc5b50c9cab8424c7fa15adab1" target="_blank">inspired</a> real-world violence. Smaller creators, like Bowles, might get hit up <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-avoid-tiktok-shop-scams" target="_self">to hawk products in the TikTok shop</a> (he declined such offers). For someone like Cenat, the vast payouts come with viral YouTube videos. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>While the subjects <em>addressed within</em> the beef are severe, the notion of rap beef itself is a relatively low-stakes but high-interest subject for a creator to cover. It has drama and endless fodder &mdash; think of all the lyrics you could break down. It's like reality TV. Think of the reactions, theories, and amateur sleuthing that arose out of the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tom-sandoval-vanderpump-scandal-explained" target="_self">Scandoval saga from Bravo's </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/tom-sandoval-vanderpump-scandal-explained" target="_self"><em>Vanderpump Rules</em></a>. At least in the digital world, it's an opportunity to react, take sides, and find nuggets of info. You can go through Kendrick's lyrics and Tom Sandoval's Instagram page with effectively the same fine-tooth internet-comb, even if the subjects are quite different. </p><p>In short, everything with drama is grist for the internet's mill. So long as Drake and Kendrick are beefing, people will get views off it. Currently, however, we're just waiting for the next song. There <a href="https://x.com/Akademiks/status/1788567176724590871" target="_blank">have been hints</a> Drake has something brewing &mdash; get your ring lights and front-facing cameras ready. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The day after the film hit theaters, the internet was flooded with video edits showcasing the movie's most captivating &mdash; and hottest &mdash; moments. These impressive fan creations range in tone from playful montages of Patrick (O'Connor)'s most lethal moments set to <a href="https://twitter.com/SATYRlCON/status/1785733577717481753" target="_blank">"I'm Too Sexy"</a> to the perfect pairing of Lorde's <a href="https://x.com/ianamurray/status/1784591968913240416" target="_blank"><u>"Tennis Court"</u></a> with a highlight reel of the film.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The edits draw from various sources, including the film's trailers, behind-the-scenes footage, and even the scene dissected by <em>The New York Times'</em> "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01ZXMrPGMyA&amp;list=PL4CGYNsoW2iBup_LVjhX7C9qceoMpiLEL" target="_blank"><u>Anatomy of a Scene</u></a>" series (including the fan-favorite sequence of Art and Patrick eating churros). </p><p>However, there's a side to these edits that casual viewers might not be aware of: the use of "cam quality" clips and grainy videos ripped from illicit recordings of the film. </p><p>"There are two cam versions of <em>Challengers</em> that I'm aware of," Kenzie, a 19-year-old student and fancam editor in South Carolina, told Mashable. "One has fewer watermarks and slot machines [logos] than the other." These watermarks, often advertising gambling sites, are a common sight in pirated versions of films uploaded to various piracy websites &mdash; part of a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wnk7n5/how-gambling-firms-are-funding-your-favourite-illegal-streaming-sites" target="_blank"><u>quid pro quo relationship</u></a> between online betting and bootleg sites.&nbsp;</p><p>These watermarks are visible in many of the most famous <em>Challengers</em> fancams. A video <a href="https://x.com/vibezgal0re/status/1786462013067047194" target="_blank"><u>dedicated</u></a> to Art (Faist) features a blue "1xBet" logo. "<a href="http://Slotslights.net" target="_blank">Slotslights.net</a>" pops up in bold white lettering in a different Art edit. Both have since been removed from Twitter but remain up on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>While the recordings speed up fans' ability to revisit the film's highlights, using cam-quality video clips is somewhat controversial among fan editors. None of the four editors Mashable spoke to (three of which use cam recordings) opposed the use of the pirated version of the film for ethical reasons. It was all about the aesthetics of their craft. Many told Mashable they prefer to wait for the HD pirated version to come out &mdash; usually available once a film goes streaming. However, the online frenzy over<em> Challengers</em> means that these<em> </em>cam-quality edits are in hot demand, and with a month-long window between its release and its premiere on video-on-demand (VOD), the allure of cam clips is more vital than ever.&nbsp;</p><p>"I had a lot to say about [<em>Challengers</em>], but I wasn't sure how to articulate it, so I decided to make edits instead," Alison* told Mashable.</p><p>Bootlegging popular movies has been a profitable venture for decades, but as fan editors work within a changing film industry, their currency has waned. Since the pandemic began, more films have gone straight to streaming or do so soon after their theatrical release, making cam-quality videos less popular among editors. The editors I spoke to pointed to movies like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bottoms-movie-review" target="_self"><em>Bottoms</em></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-hunger-games-the-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes-review" target="_self"><em>The Ballad of Bongbirds and Snakes</em></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/priscilla-movie-review" target="_self"><em>Priscilla</em></a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/spider-man-no-way-home-review" target="_self"><em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em></a><em> </em>as a few recent exceptions. But, as Kenzie observes, <em>Challengers</em> has reinvigorated the demand. She says it has produced the most cam-quality edits she has ever seen in her six years of creating.&nbsp;</p><p>Alison, who chose to remain anonymous out of fear that speaking publicly about cam-recorded clips would ostracize them from the fan edit community, prefers to use HD clips in their edits. "I usually tend to wait, but that's because the quality usually lowers a lot when you post it," they told Mashable. Despite their usual preferences, they <em>have</em> posted cam-quality <em>Challengers</em> edits. Before being removed from Twitter for copyright, the videos were some of their most popular fan edits.</p><p>On the other hand, Kenzie doesn't wait for the HD version. "I'm impatient. When I want to edit something, I want to do it then," she said. "With a film like <em>Challengers,</em> all the hype, demands for edits, and everyone talking about it, people want to see all the scenes in the film."</p><p>Editors don't seem concerned about involving themselves in the world of piracy. The nature of fan edits already subjects their accounts to copyright strikes, usually for music. TikTok is stringent on music copyright, so editors will circumvent by pitching up or slowing down a copyrighted song. But it happens on Twitter as well. Getting copyrighted for the clips is rare, but it has been a problem for editors using cam-recorded <em>Challengers</em> clips on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><h2>Scene pack accounts: the backbone of the fan edit community</h2><p>The catch: Kenzie and other eager editors don't access the pirated movie themselves. "I don't know how to do all that. [I've got] no tech genius whatsoever. I don't know how people download them, but props to them," she said. Like most fan editors, she relies on what are known as "scene pack accounts" to make edits.&nbsp;</p><p>"[The accounts] will download the movie onto a MEGA file. Or some of them will put clips of a certain character and then put them on another link so that you can download it &mdash; which makes it much easier to edit," Ash, another fan editor, explained to Mashable.</p><p>These accounts live on Instagram, posting MEGA links to specific ripped content in the caption of aesthetically themed grid posts. They are the first stop on the path to a perfect fan edit. Dominique Thomas, a 25-year-old from Moline, Illinois, runs a scene pack account with another fan editor.&nbsp;</p><p>To make a scene pack for a film, Thomas first watches the movie, then downloads it, and looks at DMs to see which character is most requested. "If they're a main character, we try to stick with their most popular moments in a film. You don't want it to be super long because that can also make an editor's life hard," they told Mashable. Then, they isolate the popular scenes and upload them to MEGA. Often, fan editors return requesting additional scenes, and Thomas obliges.&nbsp;</p><p>Each editor approaches their process differently, leading to various in-demand scenes. For example, Alison focuses on lyrical parallels. "I like to match certain scenes to lyrics; that's where most of my editing comes from," they told Mashable.</p><p>Making scene packs is a time-consuming process, and that labor, what it takes to pull scenes for fan edits, is why so many fan editors rely on scene pack accounts. Thomas made three scene packs for A24's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-iron-claw-movie-review" target="_self"><em>The Iron Claw</em></a>, one for each of the leading brothers played by Zac Efron, Jeremy Allen-White, and Harris Dickinson. It took an entire day to create. But it's done out of a love for the craft. "I love watching other people's edits. I love it when people tag me in edits&hellip;that's why we started it," said Thomas.&nbsp;</p><p>Like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/subtle-merch-fandom-tiktok" target="_self"><u>subtle merch</u></a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/reylo-fanfiction-the-hurricane-wars" target="_self"><u>fanfiction</u></a>, scene pack accounts are a part of fandom where the love of the object of your fandom drives creation and community &mdash; unconstrained by capitalism.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Running a scene pack account is a labor of love but does not come without its downsides. Between competing scene pack accounts and demanding fan editors, acting as the go-between between the film (or its bootleggers) and editors can be stressful.&nbsp;</p><p>Thomas is an editor who avoids using cam-quality edits, but if there's demand for cam-quality scene packs of a movie, they will still make them. "If I can be of any kind of help to people, then I have no problem," they said. Thomas immediately knew that <em>Challengers</em> was going to be one of those films. "Sometimes, when a trailer drops, you can anticipate how big something will be," said Thomas.</p><p>"Anything from that movie is an edit; somebody will edit it, whether it be the diaries or a 30-second TV spot. This movie is huge in the editing community," said Thomas. "And I think it still will be, even when it comes out in HD. You're going to have months and months of <em>Challengers</em> edits."</p><p>The next time you watch a Tashi Duncan edit, remember that the sweaty <em>Challengers</em> videos on your FYP are a labor of love, much like tennis. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Oh, and that happens to be a day before Google's flagship developer conference. </p><p>Initially believed to launch on May 9 or sometime this week, now the Google Search rival is expected May 13 &mdash; right before <a href="https://io.google/2024/explore/" target="_blank">Google I/O</a>, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-plans-announce-google-search-competitor-monday-sources-say-2024-05-09/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>What might a ChatGPT search engine be like?</h2><p>A ChatGPT search engine may look like an existing Google experiment called <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-ai-search-generative-experience-details" target="_self">SGE</a> (Search Generative Experience) which provides chatbot responses at the top of the search page, followed by the traditional list of links. SGE is still in a testing ground, although it is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-testing-generative-ai-search-results" target="_self">quietly creeping</a> into some non-testers search queries. </p><p>The original ChatGPT is already considered an alternative to a search engine. Its current knowledge cutoff date is May 2023, making it a useful resource for general information-gathering in a conversational chat interface. For a brief time, ChatGPT was connected to the internet through an integration with Microsoft Bing, but it was <a href="https://searchengineland.com/chatgpt-browse-with-bing-temporarily-disabled-428996" target="_blank">disabled</a> because the chatbot was able to get past paywalled content. </p><p>This, plus an ongoing struggle between publishers and OpenAI over scraping their stories without credit or compensation has made ChatGPT's position as an aggregator of newsworthy information controversial. Currently, OpenAI is dealing with lawsuits from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/new-york-times-open-ai-lawsuit" target="_self"><em>The New York Times</em></a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-intercept-raw-story-alternet-openai-lawsuit-copyright-infringement" target="_self">other news outlets</a> over plagiarism and copyright infringement, while inking licensing deals with the Axel Springer, the <em>Financial Times</em>, and Dotdash Meredith to use their content to train its AI models and surface information from their sites. </p><p>Other sites have simply <a href="https://mashable.com/article/open-ai-gptbot-crawler-block" target="_self">blocked OpenAI from crawling their pages</a> for content to feed the company's AI models. </p><p>How ongoing licensing disputes will impact a ChatGPT search engine &mdash; the ostensible purpose of which is to surface real-time information &mdash; remains unclear. What <em>is</em> clear is that OpenAI is taking a direct shot at Google. In case you've been living under a rock that doesn't have internet access, Google completely dominates the search engine market. A ChatGPT search engine would be a direct attempt to compete with Google Search. </p><p>Microsoft Bing's AI-powered search engine (now rebranded as Copilot) <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/is-bing-ai-helping-in-the-fight-against-google-apparently-not-and-microsofts-in-denial" target="_blank">hasn't really made a dent</a> in Google's search market dominance. But it hasn't stopped others from trying to take Google's crown. Perplexity AI founded by former OpenAI and Google employees is a search engine that uses a collection of LLMs, and currently has a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-23/ai-search-startup-perplexity-valued-at-1-billion-in-funding-round" target="_blank">$1 billion valuation</a>. So OpenAI's search engine would be competing against the old guard and new startups nipping at its heels. </p><p>And step one is upstaging Google at its own party. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Buying presents for mom can be tough, especially if she's the type of person who already seems to have everything. Sometimes it's better to just let the mother figure in your life buy exactly what she wants. That's where Choice gift cards come in; the funds from one gift card can go to several different retailers so the giftee can shop as they please. And you can get a little extra back if you buy some at Target through Mother's Day.</p><p>Through May 12 at 11:59 p.m. PT, get a free $10 Target gift card when you shop at least $75 in <a href="https://zdcs.link/knJjY?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=select%20Choice%20gift%20cards&object_type=article&object_uuid=01dHxT5Pk7hQpbPDjDx3QOt&short_url=knJjY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">select Choice gift cards</a> at Target in-store or online.

      <description><![CDATA[Under Elon Musk, QAnon has made a comeback on X.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05N9lidm38frNK9Dc3LYq3J/hero-image.jpg" alt="QAnon followers"><p>On Jan. 6, 2021, QAnon conspiracy theorists played a significant role in inciting Donald Trump supporters to storm the Capitol building in D.C., hoping to overturn the 2020 election in favor of Trump.</p><p>Days later, Twitter <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-qanon-suspend-accounts" target="_self"><u>suspended</u></a> tens of thousands of QAnon accounts, effectively banning most users who promote the far-right conspiracy theory.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, a <a href="https://www.newsguardrealitycheck.com/p/qanon-claims-on-x-soar-by-1283" target="_blank"><u>new study</u></a> from Newsguard has uncovered that since Elon Musk acquired the company, QAnon has had a resurgence on X, formerly Twitter, over the past year.</p><h2><strong>QAnon grows on X</strong></h2><p>Tracking commonly used QAnon phrases like "QSentMe," "TheGreatAwakening," and "WWG1WGA" (which stands for "Where We Go One, We Go All"), Newsguard found that these QAnon-related slogans and hashtags have increased a whopping 1,283 percent on X under Musk.</p><p>From May 1, 2023 to May 1, 2024, there were 1.12 million mentions of these QAnon supporter phrases on X. This was a huge uptick from the 81,100 mentions just one year earlier from May 1, 2022 to May 1, 2023.</p><p>One of the most viral QAnon-related posts of the year, on the "Frazzledrip" conspiracy, has received more than 21.8 million views, according to the report. Most concerning, however, is that it was posted by a right-wing influencer who has specifically received support from Musk.</p><p>The Jan. 2024 tweet was posted by @dom_lucre, a user with more than 1.2 million followers who commonly posts far-right conspiracy theories. In July 2023, @dom_lucre was suspended on then-Twitter. Responding to @dom_lucre's supporters, Musk <a href="https://mashable.com/article/x-twitter-ces-suspension-right-wing-account-reinstated" target="_self"><u>shared</u></a> at the time that @dom_lucre was "suspended for posting child exploitation pictures."</p><p>Sharing child sexual abuse material or CSAM would result in a permanent ban on most platforms. However, Musk decided to personally intervene in favor of @dom_lucre and reinstated his account.</p><p>Since then, @dom_lucre has posted about how he earns thousands of dollars directly from X. The company allows him to monetize his conspiratorial posts via the platform's official creator monetization program.</p><p>Musk has also previously <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-defends-qanon-shaman-jan-6" target="_self"><u>voiced his support</u></a> for Jacob Chansely, a QAnon follower known as the "QAnon Shaman," who served prison time for his role in the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.</p><h2><strong>The dangers of QAnon&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>QAnon's adherents follow a number of far-right conspiracy theories, but broadly (and falsely) believe that former President Trump has been secretly battling against a global cabal of Satanic baby-eating traffickers, who just happen to primarily be made up of Democratic Party politicians and Hollywood elites.</p><p>Unfortunately, these beliefs have too often turned deadly. Numerous QAnon followers have been involved in killings fueled by their beliefs. In 2022, one Michigan man <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/09/12/igor-lanis-murder/" target="_blank"><u>killed</u></a> his wife before being fatally shot in a standoff with police. His daughter said her father spiraled out of control as he fell into the QAnon conspiracies. In 2021, another QAnon conspiracy theorists killed his two young children, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/13/1027133867/children-dead-father-claims-qanon-conspiracy-led-him-to-kill" target="_blank"><u>claiming</u></a> that his wife had "Serpent DNA" and his children were monsters.</p><p>Of course, QAnon <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-qanon-hides-on-the-internet" target="_self"><u>never completely disappeared</u></a> from social media platforms. Its followers still espoused their beliefs albeit in a more coded manner over the past few years to circumvent social media platforms' policies. Now, though, QAnon believers are once again being more open about their radical theories.</p><p>The looming November 2024 Presidential election likely plays a role in the sudden resurgence of QAnon on X, as QAnon-believing Trump supporters look to help their chosen candidate. However, Musk and X have actively welcomed these users to their social media service, eagerly providing them with a platform to spread their dangerous falsehoods.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It may not appear much different from the M2 MacBook Air on the outside, but the new M3 model <a href="https://mashable.com/article/m3-macbook-air-3-new-features" target="_self">packs a punch on the inside</a>. Besides the zippier M3 chip &mdash;&nbsp;which is an impressive 60 percent faster than the M1 chip and about 15 percent faster than the M2 chip &mdash;&nbsp;it also features WiFi 6E and has support for up to two 5K, 60Hz external displays (when it's closed). Mashable's Kimberly Gideon tested it out and was highly impressed with its powerful performance. "The 15-inch M3 MacBook Air continues to blur the line of the Air and Pro models, providing ample &ldquo;oomph&rdquo; for creatives, professionals, and students who need robust performance that can handle their multifaceted workflows," she writes. As of May 10, the base model for the 15-inch M3 Air (with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD) is down to just $1,149.99 at Amazon when you clip the on-page coupon. That's a total of $149.01 in savings and its lowest price on record.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/m3-macbook-air-15-inch" target="_self"><em>Read our full review of the 15-inch M3 MacBook Air</em></a>.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Turn your patio into an outdoor kitchen with the Ninja Woodfire Pizza Oven, an eight-in-one device that can whip up delicious pizza, roast, broil, bake, smoke, dehydrate, and more. A pizza oven at heart, though, you can create artisan pizzas in just a few minutes with five different options to choose from: Neapolitan, thin crust, New York, pan, or frozen. If you use it to cook something other than pizza, its massive capacity can squeeze in a 12-pound turkey, nine-pound pork shoulder, 12-pound prime rib dinner with veggies, and a standard casserole dish. Typically $399.99, you can save $120 at Amazon as of May 10 and snag it at an all-time low of $279.99 with the on-page coupon.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>The new <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ipad-air-2024-new-features" target="_self">iPad Air is here</a>, which means the previous generation is back down to its all-time low price. As of May 10, you can score the 2022 iPad Air with WiFi and 256GB for only $599 instead of $749. That's 20% in savings and knocks the 256GB model down to the price of the 64GB model. It may not sport the latest M3 chip, but the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/ipad-air-2022-review" target="_self">2022 iPad Air</a> is "elegant, powerful, and versatile enough for both casual users and professionals," according to Mashable's Stan Schroeder. It may technically be out of date in 2024, but make no mistake: the M1 chip is still extremely powerful.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152945/asus-rog-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-2024-revision" target="_blank">the Verge</a>, this new version of the ROG Ally will be called the ROG Ally X. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Asus ROG Ally X: Everything we know</h2><p>The Asus ROG Ally X be an iteration of the previous model rather than a straight up sequel. After all, it's the ROG Ally X, not the ROG Ally 2.</p><p>What that means is the AMD Z1 Extreme chipset and 120Hz display powering the original ROG Ally are still intact and unchanged, but there are other internal improvements. Asus SVP Shawn Yen told The Verge to expect more than a "30 to 40 percent" increase in battery life, for example, without giving away the actual specs of the device ahead of its June 2 unveiling.</p><p>The device could also allow for a wider variety of SSD upgrades and increased repairability, but again, we'll have to wait a few weeks to find out more details.</p><p>As much as I love the Steam Deck OLED, I'm down for more competition in the handheld PC space. It's just wild to think that almost nobody played PC games this way two years ago.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This year is no different, so it's time to prepare for those summer savings. Here's everything you need to know about this year's big Memorial Day sales, plus some early offers for you to start shopping right now. </p><h2>When is Memorial Day, and when do the sales start?</h2><p>This year, Memorial Day falls on Monday, May 27. But, Memorial Day weekend &mdash; the time when most of the big sales will be taking place &mdash; starts on Friday, May 24. We expect to see lots of discounts on offer during the three-day weekend, especially from mattress, appliance, and outdoor goods brands. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Are Memorial Day sales starting early?</h2><p>Some Memorial Day sales are already getting started as we speak, with some brands holding "early access" events leading up to a bigger sale during Memorial Day weekend (more on those below). Others aren't necessarily labeled as early Memorial Day sales, but you can already find a lot of savings on outdoor items, home appliances, and select electronics at retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. We do think the deals will be much better as we get closer to Memorial Day, so it may be best to just wait it out. </p><p>Though Memorial Day weekend doesn't officially begin until May 24, keep an eye out for sales starting earlier that week on May 20. </p><h2>What to buy during Memorial Day sales</h2><p>Memorial Day is always a <em>huge</em> time for doorbuster <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-online-mattresses" target="_self">mattress</a> sales, but we also expect to see big discounts on outdoor items and appliances for the summer, as well as other select home appliances and electronics. Look out for items like <a href="https://mashable.com/review/solo-stove-bonfire-2" target="_self">grills</a>, lawn care equipment, gardening supplies, and outdoor furniture. </p><p>We also foresee popular kitchen items going on sale, as well as big-ticket items like <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-4k-tvs" target="_self">TVs</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-headphones" target="_self">headphones</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-laptops" target="_self">laptops</a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/home-gym-starter-kit" target="_self">fitness equipment</a>.</p><h2>What are the best Memorial Day sales?</h2><p>The worthwhile Memorial Day sales aren't all that plentiful just yet, but more will be on the way shortly. Here are some of the best Memorial Day sales and deals that we could find so far.</p><h2>Best early Memorial Day deals 2024</h2><p><strong>Mattresses</strong></p><ul><li><p><a

However, they're certainly not nothing: First and foremost, the Magic Keyboard finally has a function row, and a 14-key one at that. That alone brings the iPad into real laptop territory. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The 2024 Magic Keyboard is also outfitted with a larger glass trackpad with haptic feedback and compatibility with Multi-Touch gestures, backlit keys, an aluminum palm rest, and a scissor mechanism with 1mm travel. No, it still doesn't need to be charged.</p><p>There's actually an argument to be made that the 2024 iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard combo create a more powerful experience than that of the MacBook Pro released a few months ago. That's because the new iPad Pros are the sole Apple devices (so far) <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-ipad-pro-2024-1" target="_self">to wield the M4 chip</a>, coined (by Apple) as the most powerful neural processing unit of any personal computer on the market. With the immersive Apple Pencil Pro also on hand, the iPad Pro and its accessories form an intimidating laptop competitor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>May 7 marks the last leg of the Apple product drop trifecta that started in the fall of 2023. After getting <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-2023-iphone-event-announcements-recap" target="_self">new iPhones</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-vs-watch-se" target="_self">new Apple Watches</a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-macbook-m3-pro-max-preorder" target="_self">new MacBooks</a>, just one major Apple product category was left ripe for a refresh this spring.

<p>A light squeeze of the Pencil Pro pops up a palette to swiftly switch between tools, line weights, and colors, while a slight rotation while holding the Pencil Pro activates barrel roll: a built-in gyroscope that reacts immediately for intuitive, precise control of pen shapes, brush tips, or animation movements. Custom interactions can also be programmed.</p><p>Control of your project is taken even further with a hover feature that allows you to target actions without even touching the screen, like previewing a line before it's drawn or switching between a pile of layers in Final Cut Pro without making a wrong move. Haptic feedback has also been enhanced to tip you off when a new layer is, in fact, perfectly in the middle.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>As always, the Apple Pencil Pro charges and stores magnetically to the side of your <a href="https://mashable.com/category/ipad" target="_self">iPad</a>.

For starters, the two variants are sleeker and lighter than any previous iPad Pros: The 11-inch version is 0.21 inches thin and weighs a mere 0.98 pounds, while the 13-inch model is 0.2 inches thin and 1.28 pounds. Apple said they're even slimmer than ye olde iPod nano, making the 2024 iPad Pro "the thinnest Apple product ever."</p><p>The new iPad Pros have also made the jump to a shiny new M4 chipset, skipping the M3 generation that powers the current Mac and <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-macbooks" target="_self">MacBook lineups</a>. It offers up to 50 percent faster CPU performance and up to four times faster GPU performance compared to the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/ipad-pro-2022-review" target="_self">previous iPad Pro</a>'s M2 chip, according to a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-unveils-stunning-new-ipad-pro-with-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-pro/" target="_blank">press release</a>. Its new GPU architecture also brings support for hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing &mdash; an iPad first. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>There's a zippier new neural engine in there, too: Apple claimed it's "more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today."</p><p>Both iPad Pro models come equipped with a new "Ultra Retina XDR" screen, which is billed as "the world&rsquo;s most advanced display." It features two stacked <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ipad-pro-oled-display-5-benefits" target="_self">OLED</a> panels for rich, vivid colors and details (Apple is calling this "Tandem OLED technology"), and it can hit up to 1,600 nits of brightness. The Ultra Wide 12MP camera with Center Stage on the front of it has been scooted over to the landscape orientation.</p><p>The new iPad Pros will be available in two aluminum finishes (silver and space black) and four storage options: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB. Shoppers also have the option to upgrade them with a new <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ipad-pro-oled-display-5-benefits" target="_self">nano-texture glass</a> display for $100 (in the 1TB and 2TB models only).</p><p>Those who put in a preorder won't have to wait too long for their new tablet to arrive: The new iPad Pro starts shipping on Wednesday, May 15.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

Previously available in just the 10.9-inch size, the iPad Air now comes in 11- and 13-inch models outfitted with the M2 chip, an upgrade from the M1.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Announced at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-may-7-ipad-event-predictions" target="_self">Apple's "Let Loose" event</a> on May 7, the updated <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ipad-pro-ipad-air-2024" target="_self">iPad Air</a> debuted alongside a new <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-ipad-pro-2024-1" target="_self">iPad Pro</a>, Magic Keyboard, and Apple Pencil Pro. In addition to the new sizes, the tablets are getting upgraded storage. The models now start with 128 GB of storage with 256 GB, 516 GB, and 1 TB options also available.</p><p>As we suspected, the front-facing camera on the new iPad Air moved to the landscape view and pairs with landscape stereo speakers for heightened sound quality. The new M2 chip gives the upgraded iPad Air faster CPU, GPU, and neural engine speed. The M2 also powers the iPad Air with machine learning. Now users can enjoy split view screens, subject lift, and live text features on the device.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
