					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at everything Google announced at Cloud Next, why cybersecurity isn't special, and the four reasons managers fail.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I spent the weekend recovering from Cloud Next. I played some miniature golf, went to a Little League game, and took my daughter to a dance at her school. That band rocked hard (too hard?) for a bunch of kids, but all the dads appreciated the guitar solo in Boston&#8217;s &#8220;More Than a Feeling.&#8221;</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/an-interview-with-google-cloud-ceo-thomas-kurian-about-googles-enterprise-ai-strategy/">An Interview with Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian About Google’s Enterprise AI Strategy</a></strong>. This was a fun read. Thomas deeply knows what he&#8217;s talking about, and I loved the insights shared here.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/google-cloud-next-2024-wrap-up?e=48754805">All 218 things we announced at Google Cloud Next ‘24 – a recap</a></strong>. Skim through to get a sense of what you can now do in Google Cloud. And, you&#8217;ll likely get a foreshadowing of what you&#8217;ll see from other clouds in the months and years ahead <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://review.firstround.com/build-your-culture-like-a-product-lessons-from-asanas-head-of-people/">Build Your Culture Like a Product — Lessons from Asana’s Head of People</a></strong>. Do you think about intentionally building culture, or does it &#8220;just happen&#8221;? I liked the advice in this article.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://kellyshortridge.com/blog/posts/cybersecurity-isnt-special/">Cybersecurity Isn’t Special</a></strong>. Wow, this piece stood out to me today. It&#8217;s full of assertive, edgy perspectives from someone credible enough to make these statements. Good read.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://beam.incubator.apache.org/blog/beam-yaml-release/">Introducing Beam YAML: Apache Beam&#8217;s First No-code SDK</a></strong>. It&#8217;s not unnatural to represent a data pipeline in a declarative fashion, so this makes sense to me.</p>



<p>[repo] <strong><a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/tree/main/gemini/sample-apps/fixmycar">Fix My Car</a></strong>. Here&#8217;s a complete reference app that you can deploy to try out retrieval augmented generation (RAG) on Google Cloud. Or, you can simply study the architecture to understand the components of such a system.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2024/04/4-reasons-why-managers-fail">4 Reasons Why Managers Fail</a></strong>. It&#8217;s not because of skills! This article calls out the handful of ways that managers fail, and how you can prevent it.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/generative-ai-ROI-enterprise-progress/712832/">Generative AI’s ROI is a work in progress</a></strong>. Not yet settled, but the it&#8217;s not hard to see where value will come from.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/uncovering-mainframe-seams.html#DataReplicationToEnableNewProductDevelopment">Uncovering the Seams in Mainframes for Incremental Modernisation: Data Replication</a></strong>. The final update to this article is complete, and it walks us through change data capture and replication techniques.</p>

I&#8217;m not sure you can ever &#8220;prevent&#8221; tech debt—like financial debt, some tech debt can even be &#8220;good&#8221; to have—but it&#8217;s something that needs to be managed.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the day before Google Cloud Next starts, so I&#8217;m spending it doing some final prep and hanging out with my team in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, the tech world keeps going &#8217;round, and I read some good items today.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/fine-tuning-large-language-models-how-vertex-ai-takes-llms-to-the-next-level-3c113f4007da">Fine Tuning Large Language Models: How Vertex AI Takes LLMs to the Next Level</a></strong>. Here&#8217;s one of the more approachable articles I&#8217;ve read about fine tuning. Abi does such a great job explaining a use case and the steps that anyone can follow to repeat her exercise.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/banks-cloud-mainframe-generative-ai-strategy/712327/">Banking’s mainframe strategies shift as boards push for AI, cloud</a></strong>. Mainframes remain a very important source of data and computing power at many big companies. </p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/ibm-mainframe-sixty-years-anniversary-cloud-skills/712325/">As mainframes turn 60, skill gaps threaten the enterprise workhorse</a></strong>. Two mainframe articles in one day? I gotta keep you guessing. This is a longer-form piece that explores the staffing opportunity and challenge around mainframes.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://thenewstack.io/shifting-left-is-now-mainstream-for-developers-or-is-it/">Shifting Left Is Now Mainstream for Developers, or Is It?</a></strong> This looks primarily at security-related activities (and vendors) that apply early in the dev cycle.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://newsletter.getdx.com/p/creativity-in-software-engineering">Creativity in Software Engineering</a></strong>. Abi looks at that research paper from Google and pulls out the key takeaways.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2024/04/corporate-learning-is-boring-but-it-doesnt-have-to-be">Corporate Learning Is Boring — But It Doesn’t Have to Be</a></strong>. We&#8217;re not talking that boring, obligatory training we all have to take. This is about the sort of training we <em>want</em> to take, but it doesn&#8217;t engage us well.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/architecture-trends-2024/">InfoQ Software Architecture and Design Trends Report &#8211; April 2024</a></strong>. The crew at InfoQ create these reports to show what is mainstream, and what&#8217;s emerging. It&#8217;s useful to do this sort of exercise for your own company to figure out what&#8217;s recommended versus incubated.</p>



<p>[guide] <strong><a href="https://dora.dev/guides/dora-metrics-four-keys/">DORA’s software delivery metrics: the four keys</a></strong>. Nathen offers up a useful deep dive into the four key indicators of a high performing organization. I like the &#8220;pitfalls&#8221; section.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/communication-patterns-resilience/">How Do We Talk to Each Other? How Surfacing Communication Patterns in Organizations Can Help You Understand and Improve Your Resilience</a></strong>. Nora has a great talk about how people talk to each other and work together. She explains the impact on scenarios like incident management.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at function calling with LLMs, whether prompt engineering is already tired, and if "platform as product" is back.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Given the fast evolution of technology right now, I wonder if enterprises are doing strategic planning exercises more often. Annual plans don&#8217;t work in this climate. As I read the items below, I was thinking about how organizations are adapting!</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/using-gemini-function-calling-in-java-for-deterministic-generative-ai-responses-4c86a5ab80a9">Deterministic Generative AI with Gemini Function Calling in Java</a></strong>. Sometimes you have to see something over and over again before it clicks. I&#8217;ve now read enough about function calling in LLMs to &#8220;get&#8221; it. Good post here from Abi.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/how-we-built-text-to-sql-at-pinterest-30bad30dabff">How we built Text-to-SQL at Pinterest</a></strong>. Is natural language about to become the preferred interface into data sources? Maybe, with the help of generative AI. Here&#8217;s what Pinterest built.</p>



<p>[guide] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/rag-capable-gen-ai-app-using-gke">Infrastructure for a RAG-capable generative AI application using GKE</a></strong>. So good. Learn how to build an AI platform that makes it possible to deploy contextual apps that know about your domain.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/prompt-engineering-AI-LLM-VMware-research/712190/">Is prompt engineering’s party over?</a></strong> That was fast. Will LLMs be better prompts, and are they already better than humans? I wouldn&#8217;t hire a dedicated &#8220;prompt engineer&#8221;, but the tech isn&#8217;t ready for the robots to take this on.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/04/aerospike-raises-100m-for-its-real-time-database-platform-to-capitalize-on-the-ai-boom/">Aerospike raises $100M for its real-time database platform to capitalize on the AI boom</a></strong>. Done right, a lot of existing data vendors will find new life by legitimately serving AI use cases. Good for Aerospike.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/parsing-invoices-using-gemini-1-5-api-with-google-apps-script-1f32af1678f2">Parsing Invoices using Gemini 1.5 API with Google Apps Script</a></strong>. There are so many creative uses of LLMs, even when applied to &#8220;boring&#8221; scenarios like processing invoices. Fun example here.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://firebase.blog/posts/2024/04/next-24">Firebase at Cloud Next &#8217;24</a></strong>. This is the most straight-up dev content I&#8217;ve seen at our cloud conference. Learn Flutter and Angular, Go and Android. And go deep on Firebase.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://www.syntasso.io/post/kubecon-eu-paris-the-re-emergence-of-platform-as-a-product">KubeCon EU Paris: The (Re)Emergence of Platform as a Product</a></strong>. I&#8217;ve been on the &#8220;platform as product&#8221; train for many years now, and modern platform engineering embraces that concept.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/understanding-dns-options-for-gke/?e=48754805">DNS providers for Google Kubernetes Engine explained</a></strong>. Geeky topic, but there are performance and reliability outcomes that stem from your choices here.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at what tech Thoughtworks thinks is hot or not, where to find generative AI design patterns, and how to fix known software vulnerabilities. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As you read through today&#8217;s list, you&#8217;ll find advice on which tech you should explore (or skip), how to think about supply chain security, and get some ideas on AI patterns.</p>



<p>[site] <strong><a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">Thoughtworks Technology Radar: Volume 30</a></strong>. This is always one of my favorite tech assessments to read. It&#8217;s worth your time to see what hot (and not) in techniques, platforms, tools, and programming languages. <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/technology-strategy/macro-trends-tech-industry-april-2024">Blog post on the trends in this report</a>.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/02/github-besieged-by-millions-of-malicious-repositories-in-ongoing-attack/">GitHub besieged by millions of malicious repositories in ongoing attack</a></strong>. That&#8217;s scary. Be extra diligent when visiting repos to ensure you&#8217;re using the &#8220;real&#8221; ones.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://jeremydmiller.com/2024/04/01/thoughts-on-modular-monoliths/">Thoughts on “Modular Monoliths.”</a></strong> Jeremy is rightfully skeptical of whether a modular monolith is the same mess with a fancier name.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/applying-large-language-models-to-dod-software-acquisition-an-initial-experiment/">Applying Large Language Models to DoD Software Acquisition: An Initial Experiment</a></strong>. Can you use LLMs to make the request for proposal/information process easier? Document summarization seems like a valid use case here.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://lakshmanok.medium.com/generative-ai-design-patterns-8eb1d937fccc">Generative AI Design Patterns</a></strong>. I wouldn&#8217;t trust much labeled as &#8220;best practice&#8221; when it comes to generative AI. It&#8217;s too early. Instead, Lak is documenting gen AI patterns as they emerge.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2024/04/osv-and-helping-developers-fix-known-vulnerabilities.html">OSV and helping developers fix known vulnerabilities</a></strong>. Add vulnerability scanning into your CI pipeline, and use this tool to remediate vulnerabilities in your code.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2024/04/ceos-is-your-business-strategy-bold-enough">CEOs, Is Your Business Strategy Bold Enough?</a></strong> It&#8217;s easy to say &#8220;be bolder&#8221; when you&#8217;re on the outside and don&#8217;t deal with the day-to-day challenges and conflict. That said, be bolder.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/introducing-gke-autopilot-burstable-workloads/?e=48754805">GKE Autopilot mode gets burstable workloads and smaller Pod sizes</a></strong>. Using GKE in Autopilot mode isn&#8217;t bold; it&#8217;s just smart. Now you can create burstable workloads and have tiny pods for more dense clusters.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-time-my-next-chapter-aaron-skonnard-jcgvc/">It’s Time for My Next Chapter</a></strong>. Job well done, Aaron, building Pluralsight into such a valuable and useful service for so many people.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2024/04/data-platform-explained/">Data Platform Explained</a></strong>. Here&#8217;s Spotify&#8217;s take on data platforms and how theirs has evolved.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/tensorflow-guide/">What is TensorFlow?</a></strong> There are a few different machine learning frameworks that folks should be familiar with, and TensorFlow is one of them.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at which JavaScript web framework is best, how to correctly review a pull request, and what you should know about vector search.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today&#8217;s reading list has some depth to it, with many long articles. But, there&#8217;s a lot of wisdom in the items you&#8217;ll find here. Pick a couple to dig into.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3713207/whats-the-best-javascript-framework.html">What’s the best JavaScript framework?</a></strong> &#8220;Best&#8221; is relative, but all these frameworks aren&#8217;t the same. I liked this evaluation and comparison. Read this for an understanding of the different approaches these frameworks take, and maybe take a new one for a spin.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2024/04/leading-a-company-that-can-thrive-in-a-chaotic-world">Leading a Company That Can Thrive in a Chaotic World</a></strong>. Most of you probably don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re in a predictable sector or environment. It&#8217;s wild out there. Here&#8217;s an article on ways you can set up a team/company to handle it better.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://jimbobbennett.dev/blogs/how-to-review-a-pr/">How to correctly review a pull request</a></strong>. This is helpful advice for engineering teams that want to be better at reviewing pull requests for code changes.</p>



<p>[docs] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/genai-mlops-blueprint">Build and deploy generative AI and machine learning models in an enterprise</a></strong>. Read through this for a rich MLOps reference blueprint. It includes links to a repo with Terraform scripts and notebooks.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://leerob.io/blog/developer-marketing">On Developer Marketing</a></strong>. Very good take from Lee. Marketing to developers is different than the efforts towards other personas.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/uncovering-mainframe-seams.html#InternalInterfaces">Uncovering the Seams in Mainframes for Incremental Modernisation: Internal Interfaces</a></strong>.

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at why it's risky to play it safe, how to use LLMs to improve factuality, and how you can build trust with others.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I had a wonderful Easter Sunday which set the tone for what will hopefully be an excellent week.  Scan through a bunch of really solid items in today&#8217;s reading list.</p>



<p>[paper] <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18802.pdf">Long-form Factuality in Large Language Models</a></strong>. From DeepMind, this paper explains that larger language models are better for factuality, and LLM agents are better than humans at rating factual accuracy.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2024/03/why-playing-it-safe-is-the-riskiest-strategic-choice">Why Playing It Safe Is the Riskiest Strategic Choice</a></strong>. The &#8220;timid transformation&#8221; may be worse than no transformation at all. You don&#8217;t have to be reckless when you decide to take bigger swings.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/gke-gemma-ollama-the-power-trio-for-flexible-llm-deployment-5f1fa9223477">GKE + Gemma + Ollama: The Power Trio for Flexible LLM Deployment</a></strong>. Open models run through open frameworks atop open platforms? Even when managed or proprietary services are &#8220;easier&#8221;, patterns like this will be justifiably popular for portability reasons.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://www.getport.io/blog/using-the-platform-engineering-maturity-model-to-evaluate-your-investment-in-internal-developer-platforms">Using the platform engineering maturity model to understand the commitment required for an internal developer platform</a></strong>. Here&#8217;s a look at how you might tackle platform engineering. I&#8217;d recommend you don&#8217;t aim for super-maturity up front. Do a minimum viable platform and see what makes sense before over-investing and over-engineering.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/avoid-blundering/">Avoid blundering: 80% of a winning strategy</a></strong>. Really good post from Jason that looks at the preventable mistakes that sink your business.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-get-ready-for-next-24-what-you-need-to-know/?e=48754805">Cloud CISO Perspectives: Get ready for Next ‘24: What you need to know</a></strong>. To make big conferences feel more controlled, it&#8217;s useful to carve up a domain of focus. If you care about security, there will be a lot to pay attention to at Google Cloud Next. Here are <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/15-must-attend-security-sessions-at-next24/?e=48754805">15 sessions</a> that are a good start.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://bakadesuyo.com/2024/03/trust/">How To Know Who You Can Trust: 6 Secrets From Research</a></strong>. You won&#8217;t get far if people don&#8217;t trust you. But earning trust, and trusting others, isn&#8217;t easy. This post offers a few suggestions.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://sazak.io/articles/visual-guide-to-slices-in-go-2024-03-25">Visual Guide to Slices in Go</a></strong>. That is a LOT of coverage for slices (array abstractions), but I particularly liked the engaging visual treatment. It definitely made a potentially-dry topic come to life.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3714688/the-bizarre-defense-of-trillion-dollar-cabals.html">Redis vs. the trillion-dollar cabals</a></strong>. Matt is fired UP about the recent Redis fork and makes the argument that it wouldn&#8217;t be needed if cloud vendors pitched in more. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/why-aws-google-and-oracle-are-backing-the-valkey-redis-fork/">More fork talk</a>.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/claude-3-on-google-cloud-20c65b308f01">Getting Started with Claude 3 on Google Cloud</a></strong>. Good look at trying out the latest Anthropic models.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://blog.research.google/2024/03/generative-ai-to-quantify-uncertainty.html">Generative AI to quantify uncertainty in weather forecasting</a></strong>. Is anyone going to tell me with a straight face that weather prediction is so good already that we don&#8217;t need AI? Didn&#8217;t think so.</p>
