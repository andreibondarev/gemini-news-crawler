					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at how Meta engineers reacted to AI assisted coding tools, how to present to audiences that know more than you, and how to design REST APIs.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I had my rehearsal at Google I/O today, and then attended a half-day offsite with my team.  Before that, I read a bunch of things you&#8217;ll find below.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://newsletter.getdx.com/p/ai-assisted-code-authoring-at-scale">AI-assisted code authoring at scale</a></strong>. When Meta rolled out AI assisted tools to their engineers, what were the results? This post reviews a paper with the details.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://blog.infernored.com/keeping-up-with-tech/">Keeping Up with Tech</a></strong>. This post was mainly about being a t-shaped developer, with a mention of how to find the &#8220;next thing&#8221; to learn about.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/@fmmagalhaes/i-built-the-same-app-with-flutter-react-native-and-ionic-33ff8b358562">I built the same app with Flutter, React Native, and Ionic</a></strong>. You can learn a lot by using different languages or frameworks to solves the same problem. Here&#8217;s a look at three popular app frameworks.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2024/05/how-to-present-to-an-audience-that-knows-more-than-you">How to Present to an Audience That Knows More Than You</a></strong>. Many folks dislike public speaking. It can be even more nerve-wracking if you know the audience is smarter than you on a given topic. That&#8217;s often the case! This article has some advice for those situations.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/unlocking-codebase-insights-with-vertex-ai-gemini-1-5-pro-a-comprehensive-guide-1f40a6f488e9">Unlocking Codebase Insights with Vertex AI Gemini 1.5 Pro: A Comprehensive Guide</a></strong>. What questions would you ask of an inherited codebase? Where are the security issues? How should I troubleshoot? What does each component do? This post shows examples for AI-based interrogation.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://thenewstack.io/do-enormous-llm-context-windows-spell-the-end-of-rag/">Do Enormous LLM Context Windows Spell the End of RAG?</a></strong> Somewhat related to the previous piece. If I can send in all my code to an LLM, I may not need it chunked up and vector-stored prior.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://robertglazer.substack.com/p/friday-forward-nvidia-jensen-huang">Good Suffering</a></strong>. Bob has a good reminder that &#8220;resilience&#8221; is a developed characteristic, and talks about having &#8220;high standards and low expectations.&#8221;</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/using-googles-gemini-function-calling-to-fetch-real-time-company-news-and-insights-from-external-d11b2da565e3">Using Google’s Gemini Function Calling to Fetch Real-Time Company News and Insights from External APIs</a></strong>. This is a good example of &#8220;function calling&#8221; as a technique for getting real-time data into your generative AI apps.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://codeopinion.com/how-to-and-how-not-to-design-rest-apis/">How to (and how not to) design REST APIs</a></strong>. Derek affirms and rejects some &#8220;conventional wisdom&#8221; around HTTP (or REST) APIs.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/it-services-tech-spend-growth-forrester-accenture-cloud-ai/715436/">IT services spend will reach $2 trillion by 2028: Forrester</a></strong>. Spending is up, especially on cloud. But this notes that cloud spending is still less than 10% of the IT services spend!</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/billed-for-unauthorized-requests-google-cloud-storage-vs-aws-s3-8d4d6551fe72">Billed for unauthorized requests? Google Cloud Storage vs. AWS S3</a></strong>. This topic came up a week or so ago when a user got a massive bill for unauthorized 403 requests to their Amazon S3 bucket. AWS is fixing that, and this post looks at whether you&#8217;re at the same risk on Google Cloud. Hint: you&#8217;re not.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://blog.howardjohn.info/posts/podless-kubernetes/">Podless Kubernetes</a></strong>. As an academic exercise, could you deploy a full Kubernetes cluster and mesh in a single node binary, without any pods running? John did just that.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at how gatekeepers limit the benefits of continuous delivery, how a cloud-managed database compares to a self-managed one, and how one might do chaos testing on a database.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s the end of a solid workweek. Next week, I&#8217;ll be at Google I/O <a href="https://io.google/2024/explore/d347231e-4f66-4b2b-8c8b-f9090068bc79/">delivering the cloud keynote</a>, and then jetting off to Vegas to talk to analysts at the Gartner event going on there. Those events have wildly different audiences, and I deeply enjoy both.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://thenewstack.io/gatekeepers-limit-continuous-deliverys-benefits/">Gatekeepers Limit Continuous Delivery’s Benefits</a></strong>. The <a href="https://www.leanproduction.com/theory-of-constraints/">theory of constraints</a> says you have to optimize the limiting factor. If you improve how fast folks can write code, but can&#8217;t ship it any faster, what&#8217;s the point?</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://blog.gopenai.com/building-ai-powered-apps-with-langchain-a-2024-guide-a21df1d26b6c">Building AI-Powered Apps with LangChain: A 2024 Guide</a></strong>. Good details about this framework that has quickly become a go-to for folks building generative AI apps.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/alloydb-vs-self-managed-postgresql-a-price-performance-comparison">AlloyDB vs. self-managed PostgreSQL: a price-performance comparison</a></strong>. There are, of course, cases where self-managing hardware or software is a better move for you. But the number of cases is shrinking.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/media-entertainment/paramount-global-built-its-streaming-platform-on-google-cloud/">Paramount+: A streaming powerhouse with limitless entertainment</a></strong>. Few folks need a zero-downtime, globally available service. But when you do, or if you want to apply the lessons learned from such an approach, see this post.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/beacamp-pub/6-best-practices-for-hosting-developer-focused-events-840a39c1ee2e">6 Best Practices for Hosting Developer-Focused Events</a></strong>. The in-person meetup scene seems hot right now, with lots of tech folks getting together to learn. This is a good post for those putting on events.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2024/05/kubernetes-130-is-now-available-in-gke.html">Kubernetes 1.30 is now available in GKE in record time</a></strong>. Staying up to date in your Kubernetes cluster isn&#8217;t about features; it&#8217;s about security and stability updates. Nobody keeps you up to date like our GKE team.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/active-assist-gets-new-hub-and-recommendations/">What’s new with Active Assist: New Hub UI and four new recommendations</a></strong>. Even if the AI hype train has taken focus off cost and security optimization, those things still matter a ton. I like the new security and audit-related &#8220;recommendations&#8221; we&#8217;re offering Cloud customers now.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://dev.to/ceceliacreates/the-devrel-guide-to-business-jargon-2042">The DevRel Guide to Business Jargon</a></strong>. Get definitions of common sales and marketing terms like TAM, ARR, conversion rate, and more.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/chaos-testing-spanner-improves-reiliability/">How chaos testing adds extra reliability to Spanner’s fault-tolerant design</a></strong>. I was impressed by the extent to which we try to &#8220;break&#8221; Spanner to test its reliability. You might find inspiration for tests you want to run against your own systems.</p>

A <a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/openai-is-doomed-et-tu-microsoft">related perspective here</a>.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/controlling-metric-flow-in-managed-service-for-prometheus/">Controlling metric ingestion with Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus</a></strong>. If you&#8217;re drowning in metrics, and paying a lot for the privilege, consider some of the steps called out here.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at what you should know when building dev tool websites, what causes the biggest effect on code quality, and how McDonalds standardizes software at scale.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Weirdly, many of the things I read today seemed to relate to other things I read today. I&#8217;ll chalk it up to a weird wrinkle in the universe.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://www.plg.news/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-building-developer-website">The Ultimate Guide to building Developer Tool Websites</a></strong>. This post justifies the title of &#8220;ultimate guide.&#8221; It&#8217;s a really good look at how to build websites that developers find useful.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/a-tour-of-gemini-1-5-pro-samples-da48e3c907b3">A tour of Gemini 1.5 Pro samples</a></strong>.

<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-deepmind-isomorphic-alphafold-3-ai-model/">AlphaFold 3 predicts the structure and interactions of all of life’s molecules</a></strong>. Talk about humbling! We&#8217;re now learning more about the biological world than ever before.</p>



<p>[[blog] <strong><a href="https://bartwullems.blogspot.com/2024/05/the-biggest-effect-on-code-quality.html">The biggest effect on code quality</a></strong>. This author says its not about tools or skills; code quality is impacted by teams working in &#8220;crunch mode&#8221; and making mistakes.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://rdel.substack.com/p/rdel-41-what-causes-new-engineers">What causes new engineers to “sink or swim”?</a></strong> If you want new developers on your team to be successful, check out this guidance for what determines that.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://thenewstack.io/what-can-incident-teams-learn-from-crisis-management/">What Can Incident Teams Learn From Crisis Management?</a></strong> My friend Dormain wrote up an insightful piece on the need for strong communication during incidents.</p>

I don&#8217;t know if Istio helps you simplify things, but it&#8217;s definitely a powerful mesh that&#8217;s getting easier to use.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/observability-telemetry-monitoring">Observability, Telemetry, and Monitoring: Learn About the Differences</a></strong>. Stop using these words interchangeably! I&#8217;m mostly saying that to myself. But also, you might find this clarifying.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at using AI to ask questions of unstructured data, how to pick the right container base image, and how to resolve the four types of team conflict.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today&#8217;s reading list had some good practical examples, and also some thought-provoking ideas. Did any resonate with you too?</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/moneyball-with-genai-using-vertex-ai-search-to-find-the-next-generation-of-baseball-stars-cc3921907d98">Moneyball with GenAI: Using Vertex AI Search to Find the Next Generation of Baseball Stars</a></strong>. If you want me to read and share your post, just make it about baseball. Well done, Alok. This is an excellent demonstration of how AI can change how we interact with unstructured data.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/service-extensions-callouts-for-application-load-balancing">5 ways Service Extensions callouts can improve your Cloud Load Balancing environment</a></strong>. This product update didn&#8217;t catch my eye, but a Google Engineering Fellow told me I should give it a second look. Thanks, Anna. Yes, it <em>is</em> a very powerful way to add intelligence and security as part of cloud traffic management. Also <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/whats-new-for-networking-at-next24">mentioned here</a> as part of a cross-cloud strategy.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/enterprise-generative-ai-spending-modernize-tech/715158/">Enterprises prep for big AI spending, but data woes prevent progress</a></strong>. It looks like most companies are recognizing the importance of a solid data strategy.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/alpine-distroless-or-scratch-caac35250e0b">alpine, distroless or scratch?</a></strong> A small, minimum-dependency base image for your containers is a smart bet. This post looks at 4 options, and the implications of each.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3715444/what-software-developers-hate.html">What software developers hate</a></strong>. Short post, but Matt looks at three things—scope creep, pace of learning, lack of time to code—that drive developers bonkers.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering-for-a-mainframe-design-thinking-drives-change/">Platform Engineering for a Mainframe: Design Thinking Drives Change</a></strong>. You can apply modern practices (with varying levels of impact) to nearly any technology stack. I like efforts like this which try to help users of &#8220;legacy&#8221; systems get a better dev experience.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2024/05/4-common-types-of-team-conflict-and-how-to-resolve-them">4 Common Types of Team Conflict — and How to Resolve Them</a></strong>. Conflict, even temporary, is inevitable in a team. This article identifies each type, and how to respond.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://wietsevenema.eu/build-and-deploy-a-langchain-app-with-a-vector-database/">Build and Deploy a Langchain App With a Vector Database</a></strong>. Wietse wrote a very good walkthrough of the steps for building a generative AI app.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://kellblog.com/2024/05/03/does-your-marketing-pass-the-duck-test/">Does Your Marketing Pass the Duck Test?</a></strong> This is a good read, especially for folks who crave plain-English descriptions that actually tell you something.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at why you should use "thin" events in your architecture, who the leaders in AI developer services are, and whether WebAssembly is getting traction.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It was a wild, frantic day, and now I&#8217;m sitting in the airport waiting to fly home. My days are never boring, which is a gift! A <em>little</em> more boring might be nice.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/architecture/thin-events-the-lean-muscle-of-event-driven-architecture">Thin Events: The lean muscle of event-driven architecture</a></strong>. Gosh, I remember writing about this topic fifteen years ago. Even today, it&#8217;s important to make conscious choices about how you shape your messages—&#8221;thick&#8221; messages that contain all the data, or &#8220;thin&#8221; messages that are only notifications.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://thenewstack.io/recurrentgemma-an-open-language-model-for-smaller-devices/">RecurrentGemma: An Open Language Model For Smaller Devices</a></strong>. Transformers are all the rage for deep learning models, but the Gemma team used a different approach with this model. And got good results.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/01/atlassian-launches-rovo-its-new-ai-teammate/?guccounter=1">Atlassian launches Rovo, its new AI teammate</a></strong>. While I&#8217;m not smart enough to understand why every vendor needs to create their own foundation model, I <em>do</em> get why everyone is offering agent-builder experiences.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/c-and-vertex-ai-gemini-streaming-api-bug-and-workaround-dd5eb61f1f8e">C# and Vertex AI Gemini streaming API bug and workaround</a></strong>. We know that our interactions with APIs is sometimes affected by choices within our programming language itself. This issues within C# is causing an issue calling the Gemini API, but a fix is on the way.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://auth0.com/blog/the-backend-for-frontend-pattern-bff/">The Backend for Frontend Pattern</a></strong>. If you&#8217;re doing single-page apps, or just looking for more ideas around authentication in distributed systems, check out this post.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://go.dev/blog/randv2">Evolving the Go Standard Library with math/rand/v2</a></strong>. Developers often use random number generators in their code. This is a big, interesting post on the new generator in Go, and how we introduced a breaking change.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/google-is-a-leader-in-the-2024-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-cloud-ai-developer-services/">Google is a Leader in the 2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant<img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> for Cloud AI Developer Services</a></strong>. Any analyst assessment related to AI is outdated the moment it ships, but there are definitely fundamental criteria that are durable. I&#8217;m glad to see us show up well here. </p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://blog.upbound.io/announcing-upbound-now-everywhere">Upbound now everywhere: A fully automated Crossplane experience for platform engineers</a></strong>. Crossplane is a cool CNCF project for managing infrastructure across clouds, and the sponsoring company now has a managed service for you.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/understanding-cloud-storages-new-soft-delete-feature/">Managing Cloud Storage soft delete at scale</a></strong>. Everyone makes mistakes, and it&#8217;s good to be able to recover &#8220;deleted&#8221; files if needed. I was impressed reading this post and seeing the breadth we considered (metrics, Terraform, APIs) to manage this new type of object.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://thenewstack.io/webassembly-adoption-its-complicated-says-cncf-survey/">WebAssembly Adoption: It’s Complicated, Says CNCF Survey</a></strong>. I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve ever had Wasm come up in a customer conversation during the past four years. Maybe it&#8217;s who I talk to. Or it&#8217;s just not that relevant to most developers.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://www.syntasso.io/post/kubecrash-platform-engineering-recap-from-silo-busting-to-thinnest-viable-platforms">KubeCrash Platform Engineering Recap: From Silo Busting to Thinnest Viable Platforms</a></strong>. You can use tools like Gemini to summarize videos, but I still like when humans do it. This post has some takeaways about platform engineering from a recent event.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at how to build a streaming data pipeline, why you should be careful about using AI assistance for code refactoring, and what Java devs are using in 2024.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I had a very enlightening day of leadership meetings and am very bullish on the things Google Cloud is working on for customers. Energy level is high around here! I started my day with lots of reading, which you&#8217;ll find below.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/retail-banking-core-hybrid-cloud-modernization-endava/714782/">Retail banking turns to core modernization as cloud strategies mature</a></strong>. It&#8217;s time to finish some of those modernizations, people! These small, incremental approaches take too long, and it&#8217;s holding up future progress.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/%EF%B8%8Fgcp-data-engineering-project-streaming-data-pipeline-with-pub-sub-and-apache-beam-dataflow-40341c3757c4">GCP Data Engineering Project: Streaming Data Pipeline with Pub/Sub and Apache Beam/Dataflow</a></strong>. Big post showing off a complete solution for aggregating messages in a streaming architecture.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3715267/mongodb-aims-to-jumpstart-ai-app-development-with-maap.html">MongoDB aims to jumpstart AI app development with MAAP</a></strong>. More tools and professional services on the way to help folks build generative AI apps.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://bravenewgeek.com/how-konfig-provides-an-enterprise-platform-with-gitlab-and-google-cloud/">How Konfig provides an enterprise platform with GitLab and Google Cloud</a></strong>. I&#8217;d suspect that if you&#8217;re reading my post, you probably have a source control system in place. But if not, or if you need an upgrade, I like what Real Kinetic is doing to make it easier to set up an enterprise-grade deployment.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3715285/ai-still-has-a-ways-to-go-in-code-refactoring.html">AI still has a ways to go in code refactoring</a></strong>. Readability and maintainability matter as much (more than?) coding speed, and Matt points out the need to supervise what AI is generating.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2024/04/supercharged-developer-portals/">Supercharged Developer Portals</a></strong>. Good for Spotify for commercializing their open source tech and making developer portals easier to set up and use.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-your-task-create-autonomous-agents-neuronn-oiw7c/">AI, Your Task: Create Autonomous Agents</a></strong>. Vik (with help from AI) wrote this piece about &#8220;foundation agents&#8221; that learn and adapt to their environments.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/who-takes-a-risk-on-new-technology">Who Takes a Risk on New Technology?</a></strong> That new technology won&#8217;t take off if there aren&#8217;t people willing to make personal bets on it. This article starts with a story about directors in Hollywood, and connects it to technology adoption.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3715425/java-17-is-most-used-lts-version-of-java-report.html">Java 17 is most-used LTS version of Java – report</a></strong>. It&#8217;s very good to see that Java 8 is finally falling out favor with Java devs. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at scaling developer experience, how to do large document summarization, and how the latest AI models stack up to each other.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Travel day as I jetted up to Sunnyvale for a week of meetings. The year is 1/3 over after tomorrow, so hopefully you&#8217;re tracking towards some of your 2024 goals!</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://thenewstack.io/devex-success-how-pfizer-scaled-to-1000-engineers/">DevEx Success: How Pfizer Scaled to 1,000 Engineers</a></strong>. Building a great developer experience for an individual team is wonderful, and not trivial. Scaling that to hundreds or thousands? Entirely different problem. This article has good advice.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/26/the-ibm-hashicorp-coupling-could-be-more-complicated-than-it-seems/">The IBM-HashiCorp coupling could be more complicated than it seems</a></strong>. This acquisition definitely got folks talking. Here&#8217;s another perspective from TechCrunch. And Forrest <a href="https://newsletter.goodtechthings.com/p/why-didnt-google-cloud-buy-hashicorp">wrote a thing too</a>.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/level-up-your-rag-tuning-embeddings-on-vertex-ai-901bb7f65bd0">Level Up your RAG: Tuning Embeddings on Vertex AI</a></strong>. Can you bubble up the most relevant answers from an LLM through tuning? Ivan has a deep dive here.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/long-document-summarization-with-workflows-and-gemini-models">Long document summarization with Workflows and Gemini models</a></strong>. Map/reduce for big documents you&#8217;re trying to summarize with generative AI? I like this pattern.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://shiftmag.dev/what-is-devops-3236/">Is DevOps just a conspiracy theory?</a></strong> A bit of a tongue in cheek post, but related to an important question about what DevOps is really about.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/gemini-for-malware-analysis/">From Assistant to Analyst: The Power of Gemini 1.5 Pro for Malware Analysis</a></strong>. Does the giant context window of the Gemini model help with reverse engineering malware? Looks like it.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/top-generative-ai-models-grading-system/714625/">Google’s Gemini beats GPT-4, Llama 2 in model grading test</a></strong>. The &#8220;best&#8221; is a fast-changing label, but I&#8217;m glad Gemini is currently doing well compared to peers.</p>
