					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at function calling with LLMs, whether prompt engineering is already tired, and if "platform as product" is back.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Given the fast evolution of technology right now, I wonder if enterprises are doing strategic planning exercises more often. Annual plans don&#8217;t work in this climate. As I read the items below, I was thinking about how organizations are adapting!</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/using-gemini-function-calling-in-java-for-deterministic-generative-ai-responses-4c86a5ab80a9">Deterministic Generative AI with Gemini Function Calling in Java</a></strong>. Sometimes you have to see something over and over again before it clicks. I&#8217;ve now read enough about function calling in LLMs to &#8220;get&#8221; it. Good post here from Abi.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/how-we-built-text-to-sql-at-pinterest-30bad30dabff">How we built Text-to-SQL at Pinterest</a></strong>. Is natural language about to become the preferred interface into data sources? Maybe, with the help of generative AI. Here&#8217;s what Pinterest built.</p>



<p>[guide] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/rag-capable-gen-ai-app-using-gke">Infrastructure for a RAG-capable generative AI application using GKE</a></strong>. So good. Learn how to build an AI platform that makes it possible to deploy contextual apps that know about your domain.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/prompt-engineering-AI-LLM-VMware-research/712190/">Is prompt engineering’s party over?</a></strong> That was fast. Will LLMs be better prompts, and are they already better than humans? I wouldn&#8217;t hire a dedicated &#8220;prompt engineer&#8221;, but the tech isn&#8217;t ready for the robots to take this on.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/04/aerospike-raises-100m-for-its-real-time-database-platform-to-capitalize-on-the-ai-boom/">Aerospike raises $100M for its real-time database platform to capitalize on the AI boom</a></strong>. Done right, a lot of existing data vendors will find new life by legitimately serving AI use cases. Good for Aerospike.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/parsing-invoices-using-gemini-1-5-api-with-google-apps-script-1f32af1678f2">Parsing Invoices using Gemini 1.5 API with Google Apps Script</a></strong>. There are so many creative uses of LLMs, even when applied to &#8220;boring&#8221; scenarios like processing invoices. Fun example here.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://firebase.blog/posts/2024/04/next-24">Firebase at Cloud Next &#8217;24</a></strong>. This is the most straight-up dev content I&#8217;ve seen at our cloud conference. Learn Flutter and Angular, Go and Android. And go deep on Firebase.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://www.syntasso.io/post/kubecon-eu-paris-the-re-emergence-of-platform-as-a-product">KubeCon EU Paris: The (Re)Emergence of Platform as a Product</a></strong>. I&#8217;ve been on the &#8220;platform as product&#8221; train for many years now, and modern platform engineering embraces that concept.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/understanding-dns-options-for-gke/?e=48754805">DNS providers for Google Kubernetes Engine explained</a></strong>. Geeky topic, but there are performance and reliability outcomes that stem from your choices here.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at what tech Thoughtworks thinks is hot or not, where to find generative AI design patterns, and how to fix known software vulnerabilities. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As you read through today&#8217;s list, you&#8217;ll find advice on which tech you should explore (or skip), how to think about supply chain security, and get some ideas on AI patterns.</p>



<p>[site] <strong><a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">Thoughtworks Technology Radar: Volume 30</a></strong>. This is always one of my favorite tech assessments to read. It&#8217;s worth your time to see what hot (and not) in techniques, platforms, tools, and programming languages. <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/technology-strategy/macro-trends-tech-industry-april-2024">Blog post on the trends in this report</a>.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/02/github-besieged-by-millions-of-malicious-repositories-in-ongoing-attack/">GitHub besieged by millions of malicious repositories in ongoing attack</a></strong>. That&#8217;s scary. Be extra diligent when visiting repos to ensure you&#8217;re using the &#8220;real&#8221; ones.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://jeremydmiller.com/2024/04/01/thoughts-on-modular-monoliths/">Thoughts on “Modular Monoliths.”</a></strong> Jeremy is rightfully skeptical of whether a modular monolith is the same mess with a fancier name.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/applying-large-language-models-to-dod-software-acquisition-an-initial-experiment/">Applying Large Language Models to DoD Software Acquisition: An Initial Experiment</a></strong>. Can you use LLMs to make the request for proposal/information process easier? Document summarization seems like a valid use case here.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://lakshmanok.medium.com/generative-ai-design-patterns-8eb1d937fccc">Generative AI Design Patterns</a></strong>. I wouldn&#8217;t trust much labeled as &#8220;best practice&#8221; when it comes to generative AI. It&#8217;s too early. Instead, Lak is documenting gen AI patterns as they emerge.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2024/04/osv-and-helping-developers-fix-known-vulnerabilities.html">OSV and helping developers fix known vulnerabilities</a></strong>. Add vulnerability scanning into your CI pipeline, and use this tool to remediate vulnerabilities in your code.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2024/04/ceos-is-your-business-strategy-bold-enough">CEOs, Is Your Business Strategy Bold Enough?</a></strong> It&#8217;s easy to say &#8220;be bolder&#8221; when you&#8217;re on the outside and don&#8217;t deal with the day-to-day challenges and conflict. That said, be bolder.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/introducing-gke-autopilot-burstable-workloads/?e=48754805">GKE Autopilot mode gets burstable workloads and smaller Pod sizes</a></strong>. Using GKE in Autopilot mode isn&#8217;t bold; it&#8217;s just smart. Now you can create burstable workloads and have tiny pods for more dense clusters.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-time-my-next-chapter-aaron-skonnard-jcgvc/">It’s Time for My Next Chapter</a></strong>. Job well done, Aaron, building Pluralsight into such a valuable and useful service for so many people.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2024/04/data-platform-explained/">Data Platform Explained</a></strong>. Here&#8217;s Spotify&#8217;s take on data platforms and how theirs has evolved.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/tensorflow-guide/">What is TensorFlow?</a></strong> There are a few different machine learning frameworks that folks should be familiar with, and TensorFlow is one of them.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at which JavaScript web framework is best, how to correctly review a pull request, and what you should know about vector search.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today&#8217;s reading list has some depth to it, with many long articles. But, there&#8217;s a lot of wisdom in the items you&#8217;ll find here. Pick a couple to dig into.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3713207/whats-the-best-javascript-framework.html">What’s the best JavaScript framework?</a></strong> &#8220;Best&#8221; is relative, but all these frameworks aren&#8217;t the same. I liked this evaluation and comparison. Read this for an understanding of the different approaches these frameworks take, and maybe take a new one for a spin.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2024/04/leading-a-company-that-can-thrive-in-a-chaotic-world">Leading a Company That Can Thrive in a Chaotic World</a></strong>. Most of you probably don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re in a predictable sector or environment. It&#8217;s wild out there. Here&#8217;s an article on ways you can set up a team/company to handle it better.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://jimbobbennett.dev/blogs/how-to-review-a-pr/">How to correctly review a pull request</a></strong>. This is helpful advice for engineering teams that want to be better at reviewing pull requests for code changes.</p>



<p>[docs] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/genai-mlops-blueprint">Build and deploy generative AI and machine learning models in an enterprise</a></strong>. Read through this for a rich MLOps reference blueprint. It includes links to a repo with Terraform scripts and notebooks.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://leerob.io/blog/developer-marketing">On Developer Marketing</a></strong>. Very good take from Lee. Marketing to developers is different than the efforts towards other personas.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/uncovering-mainframe-seams.html#InternalInterfaces">Uncovering the Seams in Mainframes for Incremental Modernisation: Internal Interfaces</a></strong>. This article keeps getting updated with more content. The latest addition looks at internal data interfaces that you can shift from the mainframe.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://thenewstack.io/vector-search-what-you-need-to-know-before-getting-started/">Vector Search: What You Need to Know Before Getting Started</a></strong>. We don&#8217;t all need to become experts on vector databases, but it&#8217;s useful to know some fundamentals.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/noisy-neighbor">Survival Strategies for the Noisy Neighbor Apocalypse</a></strong>. Here&#8217;s a detailed look at detecting and mitigating a noisy neighbor in a multi-tenant environment at Netflix.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://thenewstack.io/how-should-we-define-open-ai/">How Should We Define ‘Open’ AI?</a></strong> Does it matter if AI models claiming to be &#8220;open source AI&#8221; don&#8217;t meet the definition? Many won&#8217;t care. It&#8217;s a blurry space at the moment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at why it's risky to play it safe, how to use LLMs to improve factuality, and how you can build trust with others.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I had a wonderful Easter Sunday which set the tone for what will hopefully be an excellent week.  Scan through a bunch of really solid items in today&#8217;s reading list.</p>



<p>[paper] <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18802.pdf">Long-form Factuality in Large Language Models</a></strong>. From DeepMind, this paper explains that larger language models are better for factuality, and LLM agents are better than humans at rating factual accuracy.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2024/03/why-playing-it-safe-is-the-riskiest-strategic-choice">Why Playing It Safe Is the Riskiest Strategic Choice</a></strong>. The &#8220;timid transformation&#8221; may be worse than no transformation at all. You don&#8217;t have to be reckless when you decide to take bigger swings.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/gke-gemma-ollama-the-power-trio-for-flexible-llm-deployment-5f1fa9223477">GKE + Gemma + Ollama: The Power Trio for Flexible LLM Deployment</a></strong>. Open models run through open frameworks atop open platforms? Even when managed or proprietary services are &#8220;easier&#8221;, patterns like this will be justifiably popular for portability reasons.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://www.getport.io/blog/using-the-platform-engineering-maturity-model-to-evaluate-your-investment-in-internal-developer-platforms">Using the platform engineering maturity model to understand the commitment required for an internal developer platform</a></strong>. Here&#8217;s a look at how you might tackle platform engineering. I&#8217;d recommend you don&#8217;t aim for super-maturity up front. Do a minimum viable platform and see what makes sense before over-investing and over-engineering.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/avoid-blundering/">Avoid blundering: 80% of a winning strategy</a></strong>. Really good post from Jason that looks at the preventable mistakes that sink your business.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-get-ready-for-next-24-what-you-need-to-know/?e=48754805">Cloud CISO Perspectives: Get ready for Next ‘24: What you need to know</a></strong>. To make big conferences feel more controlled, it&#8217;s useful to carve up a domain of focus. If you care about security, there will be a lot to pay attention to at Google Cloud Next. Here are <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/15-must-attend-security-sessions-at-next24/?e=48754805">15 sessions</a> that are a good start.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://bakadesuyo.com/2024/03/trust/">How To Know Who You Can Trust: 6 Secrets From Research</a></strong>. You won&#8217;t get far if people don&#8217;t trust you. But earning trust, and trusting others, isn&#8217;t easy. This post offers a few suggestions.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://sazak.io/articles/visual-guide-to-slices-in-go-2024-03-25">Visual Guide to Slices in Go</a></strong>. That is a LOT of coverage for slices (array abstractions), but I particularly liked the engaging visual treatment. It definitely made a potentially-dry topic come to life.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3714688/the-bizarre-defense-of-trillion-dollar-cabals.html">Redis vs. the trillion-dollar cabals</a></strong>. Matt is fired UP about the recent Redis fork and makes the argument that it wouldn&#8217;t be needed if cloud vendors pitched in more. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/why-aws-google-and-oracle-are-backing-the-valkey-redis-fork/">More fork talk</a>.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/claude-3-on-google-cloud-20c65b308f01">Getting Started with Claude 3 on Google Cloud</a></strong>. Good look at trying out the latest Anthropic models.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://blog.research.google/2024/03/generative-ai-to-quantify-uncertainty.html">Generative AI to quantify uncertainty in weather forecasting</a></strong>. Is anyone going to tell me with a straight face that weather prediction is so good already that we don&#8217;t need AI? Didn&#8217;t think so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Some of you may have had a holiday today, but I was grinding through my inbox and getting some good work done. Enjoy the Easter weekend, and try not to eat too many Peeps.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://thenewstack.io/how-to-write-sql-queries/">How to Write SQL Queries</a></strong>. This is a good introductory article to writing SQL, and might be a good refresher for folks who don&#8217;t write it all the time (*raises hand*).</p>

<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.thestack.technology/redis-fork-valkey-linux-foundation/">AWS, Google, Oracle back Redis fork “Valkey” under the Linux Foundation</a></strong>.

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at why the future of frontend dev is already here, how to get tech debt work onto your roadmap, and how to achieve greatness without falling apart.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We had our first in-person rehearsal for the Cloud Next &#8217;24 developer keynote, and my stress level dropped a little bit. It feels good to be close to the finish line, and we have such a great team involved in it. Heading home now, and snuck in a bit of reading throughout the day.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://redmonk.com/kholterhoff/2024/03/28/the-future-of-frontend-is-already-here/">The Future of Frontend is Already Here</a></strong>.

<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://engineering.squarespace.com/blog/2024/why-we-built-a-write-back-cache-for-our-asset-library-with-google-cloud-spanner">Why We Built a Write Back Cache for Our Asset Library with Google Cloud Spanner</a></strong>. The team at Squarespace wanted to improve some user and dev experiences, and wrote up an explanation of why (and how) they built a cache.</p>

How does an LLM pick the next word in a sentence? Read this for additional understanding.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/getting-tech-debt-on-roadmap">How to Get Tech-Debt on the Roadmap</a></strong>. I thought this was a very good perspective on how to frame and prioritize work on technical debt. </p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://thenewstack.io/tutorial-using-langchain-and-gemini-to-summarize-articles/">Tutorial: Using LangChain and Gemini to Summarize Articles</a></strong>. Jani put together a straightforward demo for you to see how you might use the popular LangChain framework to work with an LLM.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-sound-design/">Listen hear: How designers create sounds for Pixel</a></strong>. We&#8217;re surrounded by things that involved thoughtful design, yet we may barely notice! One of those could be sounds on our phones.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://thegrowtheq.com/achieving-greatness-without-falling-apart/">Achieving Greatness Without Falling Apart</a></strong>. Elite performers are often very competitive, but also grounded in a way that the quest can be as fulfilling as the &#8220;win.&#8221;</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://blog.risingstack.com/retrieval-augmented-generation-tutorial-google-colab/">Practical Tutorial to Retrieval Augmented Generation on Google Colab</a></strong>. Good demo that anyone can follow along with to try out RAG with Anthropic models.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at doing incremental modernization of mainframe apps, why companies are struggling to scale AI projects, and why frontend development is now a sweet gig.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today&#8217;s reading list seemed to be skewed towards &#8220;struggles.&#8221; Struggles with career progression, scaling AI programs, software supply chain risks, upgrading core infrastructure, or even doing test-driven development right. The struggle is real, but all you can do is find your next right step, and get access to those who can help you make it through.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2024/03/4-experiments-to-encourage-employees-career-progress">4 Experiments to Encourage Employees’ Career Progress</a></strong>. Getting promoted isn&#8217;t the way we should measure career progression. There are lots of ways to advance professionally, and this article explores a few ways to think about it.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/uncovering-mainframe-seams.html">Uncovering the Seams in Mainframes for Incremental Modernisation</a></strong>. This is the type of architecture work I can geek out over. It&#8217;s real forensics into a legacy system and finding seams that help you start incremental modernization.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2024/03/whats-in-name.html">What’s in a Name?</a></strong> Here&#8217;s a good little post with very useful advice on naming things in your codebase.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/llm-finops-cost-optimization-options-to-run-high-performance-ai-ml-workloads-on-gke-in-google-96f79d79c51b">LLM&amp;FinOps: Cost Optimization Options to Run High Performance AI/ML Workloads on GKE in Google Cloud</a></strong>. It wasn&#8217;t cheap for cloud providers to buy all this AI-ready hardware, and it&#8217;s not necessarily cheap for you to use it. But you can manage costs if you come into it prepared.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/accenture-ai-investments-billions-data-modernization/711132/">Accenture sees companies struggling to scale AI</a></strong>. I found a few interesting nuggets here. Big firms (cloud vendors, consulting shops) have invested in AI ahead of revenues. But the client projects are now coming. And modernization is table stakes to take advantage.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/interview/google-cloud-ciso-contrasts-shared-fate-vs-shared-responsibility-models/2024/03/">Google Cloud CISO contrasts shared fate vs. shared responsibility models</a></strong>. It&#8217;s an important distinction, and this article calls out what &#8220;shared fate&#8221; looks like.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/tech-giants-grapple-with-ballooning-software-supply-chain-risk-jfrog-report-reveals/">Tech giants grapple with ballooning software supply chain risk, JFrog report reveals</a></strong>. I mean, yeah, you&#8217;re going to have problems if you&#8217;re using a dozen different programming languages. Time to go on a purge, my friend.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://thenewstack.io/why-isnt-the-world-upgrading-its-databases/">Why Isn’t the World Upgrading Its Databases?</a></strong> From what I&#8217;ve observed, most companies don&#8217;t upgrade their infrastructure—databases, operating systems, business apps, commercial software, programming languages—until there&#8217;s a forcing function. If it just works, even if it&#8217;s out of mainstream support, it&#8217;ll keep running until something requires a change.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://www.svpg.com/the-product-model-at-amazon/">The Product Model at Amazon</a></strong>. Read this to learn a bit about how Amazon figures out which problems to try and solve, and how they use product discovery techniques to test ideas.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://redmonk.com/kholterhoff/2024/03/01/why-the-frontend-kingmaker-isnt-full-stack-a-history/">Why the Frontend Kingmaker isn’t Full-Stack: A History</a></strong>. Be proud of being a frontend engineer! That&#8217;s tough work. Kate looks at the evolution of &#8220;acceptance&#8221; for this role.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/tdd-youre-probably-doing-it-just-fine">TDD: You&#8217;re Probably Doing It Just Fine</a></strong>. Some pragmatic advice here for those who might panic that they&#8217;re not doing test-driven development correctly.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at trends from the 900 most popular open source AI tools, choosing between exactly once and at least once streaming architectures, and how to find and address burnout in your team.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It rained a lot in San Diego this past weekend, which is not part of the agreement. I&#8217;m thinking of asking for a refund on my taxes. But it&#8217;s 60 degrees and sunny today, so all is forgiven. Jump into some good items below!</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://huyenchip.com/2024/03/14/ai-oss.html">What I learned from looking at 900 most popular open source AI tools</a></strong>. Outstanding research that&#8217;s worth your attention. Chip looks at open source AI projects to detect trends and behavior.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at how people are REALLY using generative AI, how to access Salesforce data from BigQuery, and what to do when you work inside a feature factory.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I&#8217;m happy to wrapping a long, productive week. I&#8217;m hoping to have a bit of tech play time this weekend, and have a few projects in mind. I hope you find a way to enjoy yourself and do something fun.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/in-place-llm-insights-bigquery-gemini-for-structured-unstructured-data-analytics-fdfac0421626">In-Place LLM Insights: BigQuery &amp; Gemini for Structured &amp; Unstructured Data Analytics</a></strong>. Abi covers a lot of ground in this piece, and shows us both inline model calls, as well as invoking remote functions that call LLMs.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://thegrowtheq.com/the-benefits-of-craft-work/">In Defense of Craft</a></strong>. Simple, but powerful point here. Most all of work in settings where a job-well-done is based on external factors, but this post talks about the satisfaction we get from doing something that stands on its own.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/introducing-cloud-run-volume-mounts/">Introducing Cloud Run volume mounts: connect your app to Cloud Storage or NFS</a></strong>. Contorting your architecture to use fully managed compute services while also banking on persistent data storage? Now Cloud Run lets you set up volume mounts to shared data sources.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2024/03/how-people-are-really-using-genai">How People Are Really Using GenAI</a></strong>. This study surfaced a hundred different ways people are using generative AI technology. There aren&#8217;t a ton of surprises here, but it&#8217;s helpful to see it listed out.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/workload-identity-secured-way-to-access-google-cloud-apis-from-gke-workloads-44882ec5036a">Workload Identity &#8211; Secured Way to Access Google Cloud APIs from GKE Workloads.</a></strong> This has thankfully become a common idea for Kubernetes clusters, so make yourself familiar with it. Workload identity gives you a more secure way to control access from a workload to a given cloud resource (database, etc).</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://thenewstack.io/java-22-making-java-more-attractive-for-ai-apps-workloads/">Java 22: Making Java More Attractive for AI Apps/Workloads</a></strong>. It doesn&#8217;t look like any language supporters are willing to cede the AI territory to Python. Lots of languages are beefing up their readiness and applicability for AI workloads.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/03/21/xt/">Modeling Extremely Large Images with xT</a></strong>. The folks at Berkeley are proposing a new framework to understand very large images. Very cool.</p>



<p>[docs] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/salesforce-quickstart">Work with Salesforce Data Cloud data in BigQuery</a></strong>. Wow, this seems like a big deal. Natively query your Salesforce data from BigQuery and do cross-cloud analytics. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/salesforce-data-cloud-bidirectional-data-sharing-with-bigquery/">Blog post about it here</a>.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-279-how-to-learn-and-practice">How to Learn and Practice Product Management in a Feature Factory</a></strong>. Stuck in a feature factory that pumps out new capabilities and moves on? Here&#8217;s advice on how to grow as a product manager in that setting.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://chaos.guru/essays/2024/hostile-environments/">Shipping quality software in hostile environments</a></strong>. This feels related to the above article on feature factories. When you work at places that pile on tech debt because of lack of autonomy and endless shipping, you&#8217;re in trouble!</p>
