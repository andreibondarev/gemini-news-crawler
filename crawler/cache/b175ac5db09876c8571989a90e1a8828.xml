					<description><![CDATA[300 issues! Today's links look at what product management looks like for AI apps, which language (hint: Java) is hardest by dependency vulnerabilities, and a couple of ways to fine tune LLMs.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Three hundred issues of this little daily post! I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll really find my voice by the time I reach issue eight hundred. A few of the items today really got me thinking and I hope you enjoy the list.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.svpg.com/ai-product-management/">AI Product Management</a></strong>. Building AI apps (not platforms) comes with risks to consider and plan for. This is a great article for teams about to embark on that journey.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at well-intentioned behaviors that mess up your team, why "most developers have adopted devops" hides some depressing news, and what Colab is all about.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If I made up a theme for today&#8217;s reading list, I think it&#8217;s &#8220;focus.&#8221; You&#8217;ll find a few pieces that are about focusing your automation efforts, AI usage, and even your time.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3715362/most-developers-have-adopted-devops-survey-says.html">Most developers have adopted devops, survey says</a></strong>. That seems like good news, but when you drill in, you see that a surprising number of people aren&#8217;t doing CI or CD. <a href="https://devops.com/cdf-survey-surfaces-devops-progress-and-challenges/">Related story</a>.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2024/04/5-well-intentioned-behaviors-that-can-hurt-your-team">5 Well-Intentioned Behaviors That Can Hurt Your Team</a></strong>. It&#8217;s one thing to be intentionally terrible at something, but it&#8217;s worse when your seemingly best efforts have a negative impact. Here are things that many of us probably do, and should stop doing.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/ai-is-accelerating-me">AI is accelerating my technical writing output, and other observations</a></strong>. If possible, read less from &#8220;thought leaders&#8221; and more from those doing the work. Tom offers up good personal observations of how AI is impacting tech writing.</p>



<p>[survey] <strong><a href="https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8uCHA4aRzcGDjg2?source=doradotdev-banner">2024 DORA survey</a></strong>. This is the tenth year of this widely-recognized report that explores what good software delivery practices look like. Participate in this year&#8217;s survey!</p>



<p>[youtube-video] <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxJHqBthLlc">Mastering Kubernetes for Multi-Cloud Efficiency With Nick Eberts</a></strong>. Nick chats with Corey Quinn about Kubernetes. Neither of these two people is un-opinionated.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/ai-trends-report-2024/">AI Trends Report 2024: AIâ€™s Growing Role in Software Development</a></strong>. On the topic of surveys, the Docker team shared results from their own study. No surprisingly, developers are using AI tools for coding assistance, writing docs, writing tests, and troubleshooting.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/build-your-genai-strategy-on-a-rock-solid-foundation/">Build Your GenAI Strategy On A Rock-Solid Foundation (Model)</a></strong>. I believe this refers to a family of foundation models, not a specific version. They change too fast! Maybe you can&#8217;t bet on one model, but don&#8217;t accidentally over-complicate things by trying to use all of them.</p>



<p>[youtube-video] <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii6gs9zADEA">Colab 101: Your Ultimate Beginner&#8217;s Guide!</a></strong> Millions of folks use Colab every month to learn Python, run models, and do all sorts of notebook-y things. This is a very good video intro.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://redis.io/blog/building-a-rag-application-with-redis-and-spring-ai/">Building a RAG Application with Redis and Spring AI</a></strong>. You have lots of ways to orchestrate calls to an LLM. Spring AI looks nice for Java devs.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://shiftmag.dev/fighting-distractions-as-a-software-developer-3175/">There is always something: Fighting distractions as a software developer</a></strong>. Developer or not, your day is probably full of distractions. How do you force yourself to prioritize and then focus?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at common leadership styles, how to compare popular AI frameworks, and 101 real-world generative AI use cases.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Do you ever have a big project (work-related, personal life) end, and then need to reset your attention? I&#8217;m in that mode now with Cloud Next being over. I&#8217;m rediscovering my priorities list and arranging my time accordingly. My backlog of tech to play with has gotten long!</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/04/09/llamaindex-vs-langchain-a-comparison-of-artificial-intelligence-ai-frameworks">LlamaIndex vs LangChain: A Comparison of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Frameworks</a></strong>. There&#8217;s no shortage of ways to invoke LLMs. Use direct APIs, general purpose frameworks like these, or language-specific options like Spring.AI.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://arindam1729.hashnode.dev/5-developer-communities-you-must-join-in-2024">5 Developer Communities You Must Join in 2024</a></strong>. I haven&#8217;t become a Discord person, but it&#8217;s great to see so many online spaces for folks. This post highlights some good ones to join.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/04/cncf-cloudevents-graduation">Cloud Native Computing Foundation Graduation of CloudEvents: Q&amp;A with Clemens Vasters</a></strong>. Everything you wanted to know about CloudEvents, but didn&#8217;t think to ask? Steef-Jan and Clemens go into depth in this discussion, and I learned a few things.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-partnership-gemini-code-assist/">Introducing Snykâ€™s partnership with Gemini Code Assist</a></strong>. I&#8217;d be surprised if devs want a dozen different AI agents plugged into their IDEs. Funneling advice through 1-2 assistants seems like a good idea.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2024/04/6-common-leadership-styles-and-how-to-decide-which-to-use-when">6 Common Leadership Styles â€” and How to Decide Which to Use When</a></strong>. Do you have a solid answer when someone asks about your &#8220;leadership style&#8221;? If so, you&#8217;re better than me. But I liked how this article calls out the various styles and when each is appropriate.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/attacking-supply-chains-at-the-source/">Attacking Supply Chains at the Source</a></strong>. Security is a shared responsibility. Make sure you have all the scans and vulnerability checks in place, even for OSS you use!</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3715340/data-pipelines-for-the-rest-of-us.html">Data pipelines for the rest of us</a></strong>. Matt looks at Apache Airflow as a strong open source option, with cautions around most contributors coming from one company.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-cloud-generative-ai-strategy/713093/">JPMorgan Chase CEO wants more cloud to fuel AI, analytics</a></strong>. Public (and private) cloud is how JPMC wants to unlock value from data using AI. If you can&#8217;t plow billions into your own data center, skip the &#8220;private&#8221; part.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/gen-ai-business-use-cases/">101 real-world gen AI use cases featured at Google Cloud Next â€™24</a></strong>. If you need some inspiration for how to use generative AI in the real world, this is a good place to start.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at everything Google announced at Cloud Next, why cybersecurity isn't special, and the four reasons managers fail.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I spent the weekend recovering from Cloud Next. I played some miniature golf, went to a Little League game, and took my daughter to a dance at her school. That band rocked hard (too hard?) for a bunch of kids, but all the dads appreciated the guitar solo in Boston&#8217;s &#8220;More Than a Feeling.&#8221;</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/an-interview-with-google-cloud-ceo-thomas-kurian-about-googles-enterprise-ai-strategy/">An Interview with Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian About Googleâ€™s Enterprise AI Strategy</a></strong>. This was a fun read. Thomas deeply knows what he&#8217;s talking about, and I loved the insights shared here.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/google-cloud-next-2024-wrap-up?e=48754805">All 218 things we announced at Google Cloud Next â€˜24 â€“ a recap</a></strong>. Skim through to get a sense of what you can now do in Google Cloud. And, you&#8217;ll likely get a foreshadowing of what you&#8217;ll see from other clouds in the months and years ahead <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

Do you think about intentionally building culture, or does it &#8220;just happen&#8221;? I liked the advice in this article.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://kellyshortridge.com/blog/posts/cybersecurity-isnt-special/">Cybersecurity Isnâ€™t Special</a></strong>. Wow, this piece stood out to me today. It&#8217;s full of assertive, edgy perspectives from someone credible enough to make these statements. Good read.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://beam.incubator.apache.org/blog/beam-yaml-release/">Introducing Beam YAML: Apache Beam&#8217;s First No-code SDK</a></strong>. It&#8217;s not unnatural to represent a data pipeline in a declarative fashion, so this makes sense to me.</p>



<p>[repo] <strong><a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/tree/main/gemini/sample-apps/fixmycar">Fix My Car</a></strong>. Here&#8217;s a complete reference app that you can deploy to try out retrieval augmented generation (RAG) on Google Cloud. Or, you can simply study the architecture to understand the components of such a system.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2024/04/4-reasons-why-managers-fail">4 Reasons Why Managers Fail</a></strong>. It&#8217;s not because of skills! This article calls out the handful of ways that managers fail, and how you can prevent it.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/generative-ai-ROI-enterprise-progress/712832/">Generative AIâ€™s ROI is a work in progress</a></strong>. Not yet settled, but the it&#8217;s not hard to see where value will come from.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/uncovering-mainframe-seams.html#DataReplicationToEnableNewProductDevelopment">Uncovering the Seams in Mainframes for Incremental Modernisation: Data Replication</a></strong>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today was a partial workday as I caught up on (most) email as well as my reading backlog from the week. I&#8217;ll take the weekend to recover physically and mentally from an exhausting week, and should be ready to roll by Monday.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/next24-day-2-recap/?e=48754805">Day 2 at Next â€™24 recap: building AI agents</a></strong>. Here was a good roundup of our activities on day 2.</p>

<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://newsletter.goodtechthings.com/p/the-threat-to-open-source-comes-from">The threat to open source comes from within</a></strong>. Forrest explores ideas around that XZ fiasco and how OSS might have saved the day, versus been the cause. He also connects this to recent hoopla with Terraform and OpenTofu.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://thenewstack.io/how-do-open-source-licenses-work-the-ultimate-guide/">How Do Open Source Licenses Work? The Ultimate Guide</a></strong>. Speaking of open source, this article goes fairly keep into licensing, and offers a useful education for users and leaders.</p>

<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://8thlight.com/insights/managing-technical-debt">Managing Technical Debt</a></strong>. I&#8217;m not sure you can ever &#8220;prevent&#8221; tech debtâ€”like financial debt, some tech debt can even be &#8220;good&#8221; to haveâ€”but it&#8217;s something that needs to be managed.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at how to fine tune an LLM, what to do about mainframes, and how to make corporate learning less boring.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s the day before Google Cloud Next starts, so I&#8217;m spending it doing some final prep and hanging out with my team in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, the tech world keeps going &#8217;round, and I read some good items today.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/fine-tuning-large-language-models-how-vertex-ai-takes-llms-to-the-next-level-3c113f4007da">Fine Tuning Large Language Models: How Vertex AI Takes LLMs to the Next Level</a></strong>. Here&#8217;s one of the more approachable articles I&#8217;ve read about fine tuning. Abi does such a great job explaining a use case and the steps that anyone can follow to repeat her exercise.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/banks-cloud-mainframe-generative-ai-strategy/712327/">Bankingâ€™s mainframe strategies shift as boards push for AI, cloud</a></strong>. Mainframes remain a very important source of data and computing power at many big companies. </p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/ibm-mainframe-sixty-years-anniversary-cloud-skills/712325/">As mainframes turn 60, skill gaps threaten the enterprise workhorse</a></strong>. Two mainframe articles in one day? I gotta keep you guessing. This is a longer-form piece that explores the staffing opportunity and challenge around mainframes.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://thenewstack.io/shifting-left-is-now-mainstream-for-developers-or-is-it/">Shifting Left Is Now Mainstream for Developers, or Is It?</a></strong> This looks primarily at security-related activities (and vendors) that apply early in the dev cycle.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://newsletter.getdx.com/p/creativity-in-software-engineering">Creativity in Software Engineering</a></strong>. Abi looks at that research paper from Google and pulls out the key takeaways.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2024/04/corporate-learning-is-boring-but-it-doesnt-have-to-be">Corporate Learning Is Boring â€” But It Doesnâ€™t Have to Be</a></strong>. We&#8217;re not talking that boring, obligatory training we all have to take. This is about the sort of training we <em>want</em> to take, but it doesn&#8217;t engage us well.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/architecture-trends-2024/">InfoQ Software Architecture and Design Trends Report &#8211; April 2024</a></strong>. The crew at InfoQ create these reports to show what is mainstream, and what&#8217;s emerging. It&#8217;s useful to do this sort of exercise for your own company to figure out what&#8217;s recommended versus incubated.</p>



<p>[guide] <strong><a href="https://dora.dev/guides/dora-metrics-four-keys/">DORAâ€™s software delivery metrics: the four keys</a></strong>. Nathen offers up a useful deep dive into the four key indicators of a high performing organization. I like the &#8220;pitfalls&#8221; section.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/communication-patterns-resilience/">How Do We Talk to Each Other? How Surfacing Communication Patterns in Organizations Can Help You Understand and Improve Your Resilience</a></strong>. Nora has a great talk about how people talk to each other and work together. She explains the impact on scenarios like incident management.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at queuing up your app deployments, how enterprises are spending their budgets on AI, and why Ruby on Rails isn't dead.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It was a quiet end to a bonkers run-up to <a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next">Google Cloud Next</a>, which starts on Monday in Las Vegas. Most everything is done and ready to roll. I&#8217;m flying out tomorrow and have rehearsals on Sunday. I&#8217;ll plan on posting my reading list each day, but I&#8217;ll warn you ahead of time that it&#8217;ll probably be fairly Google heavy!</p>



<p>[article]<strong> <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/uncovering-mainframe-seams.html#batch-pipeline">Uncovering the Seams in Mainframes for Incremental Modernisation: Batch Pipeline Step Handoff</a></strong>. The article keeps getting extended, and this latest addition looks at &#8220;seams&#8221; in the mainframe app around data processing.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://glaforge.dev/posts/2024/04/04/calling-gemma-with-ollama-and-testcontainers/">Calling Gemma with Ollama, TestContainers, and LangChain4j</a></strong>.

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links look at function calling with LLMs, whether prompt engineering is already tired, and if "platform as product" is back.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Given the fast evolution of technology right now, I wonder if enterprises are doing strategic planning exercises more often. Annual plans don&#8217;t work in this climate. As I read the items below, I was thinking about how organizations are adapting!</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/using-gemini-function-calling-in-java-for-deterministic-generative-ai-responses-4c86a5ab80a9">Deterministic Generative AI with Gemini Function Calling in Java</a></strong>. Sometimes you have to see something over and over again before it clicks. I&#8217;ve now read enough about function calling in LLMs to &#8220;get&#8221; it. Good post here from Abi.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/how-we-built-text-to-sql-at-pinterest-30bad30dabff">How we built Text-to-SQL at Pinterest</a></strong>. Is natural language about to become the preferred interface into data sources? Maybe, with the help of generative AI. Here&#8217;s what Pinterest built.</p>



<p>[guide] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/rag-capable-gen-ai-app-using-gke">Infrastructure for a RAG-capable generative AI application using GKE</a></strong>. So good. Learn how to build an AI platform that makes it possible to deploy contextual apps that know about your domain.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/prompt-engineering-AI-LLM-VMware-research/712190/">Is prompt engineeringâ€™s party over?</a></strong> That was fast. Will LLMs be better prompts, and are they already better than humans? I wouldn&#8217;t hire a dedicated &#8220;prompt engineer&#8221;, but the tech isn&#8217;t ready for the robots to take this on.</p>



<p>[article] <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/04/aerospike-raises-100m-for-its-real-time-database-platform-to-capitalize-on-the-ai-boom/">Aerospike raises $100M for its real-time database platform to capitalize on the AI boom</a></strong>. Done right, a lot of existing data vendors will find new life by legitimately serving AI use cases. Good for Aerospike.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/parsing-invoices-using-gemini-1-5-api-with-google-apps-script-1f32af1678f2">Parsing Invoices using Gemini 1.5 API with Google Apps Script</a></strong>. There are so many creative uses of LLMs, even when applied to &#8220;boring&#8221; scenarios like processing invoices. Fun example here.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://firebase.blog/posts/2024/04/next-24">Firebase at Cloud Next &#8217;24</a></strong>. This is the most straight-up dev content I&#8217;ve seen at our cloud conference. Learn Flutter and Angular, Go and Android. And go deep on Firebase.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://www.syntasso.io/post/kubecon-eu-paris-the-re-emergence-of-platform-as-a-product">KubeCon EU Paris: The (Re)Emergence of Platform as a Product</a></strong>. I&#8217;ve been on the &#8220;platform as product&#8221; train for many years now, and modern platform engineering embraces that concept.</p>



<p>[blog] <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/understanding-dns-options-for-gke/?e=48754805">DNS providers for Google Kubernetes Engine explained</a></strong>. Geeky topic, but there are performance and reliability outcomes that stem from your choices here.</p>
