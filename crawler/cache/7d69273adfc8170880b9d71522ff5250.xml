    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[Los Angeles, CA - July 13: Portrait of Sandra Munoz, a celebrated civil rights attorney in Los Angeles. She is holding a photo of her husband Luis on January 3, 2024, in Los Angeles, CA. They have been separated since 2015. Luis, who was undocumented, applied for a waiver of his illegal entry to seek citizenship after they got married. The final step was considered a formality -- he would go back to El Salvador for an interview at the U.S. consulate there and fly back to the U.S. once it was approved. Instead, it was denied. When their lawyers pressed the government for why, the State Department admitted that his tattoos -- of La Virgen de Guadalupe, a tribal design and theatrical masks -- were among the reasons they had found him to be an MS-13 gang member, an assertion he vehemently denies. Last year, the 9th Circuit sided with the couple, but the Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court. The high court is expected to decide next month whether to take up the case, which would have ripple effects for any immigrant seeking to challenge the government's views of their character.

But even before the war, the annual job had become increasingly difficult over the years for the more than 100,000 Palestinian families in the West Bank that rely on it for their livelihood.
