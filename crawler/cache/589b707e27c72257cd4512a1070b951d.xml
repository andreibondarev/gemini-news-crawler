For example, what part of Palestine are you from, both yourself and your family going back further.</em></strong></p><p>Hi, I am Reem from Palestine, to be spacific Gaza, I have never left Palestine at the whole of my life, so Palestine is the world to me!</p><p>My grandfather is from Hamama town. He displaced from his home at Al Nakba, and build a beautiful home in Gaza. He married my grandmother and had a lot of children. He died from Cancer while he waiting my father born, he died while he was dreaming of return to Hamama. He kept the key to his old home until his death and my grandmother kept it after his death.</p><p><strong><em>If you spent part of your life in Palestine, tell me about your personal experiences there. What are your strongest memories, both good and bad? I’m curious about your education, your family life, community life, religion, and anything else you’d like to share.</em></strong></p><p>I can consider us as a family environment, interconnected with each other, interconnected with our neighbors. If my mother or grandmother made a delicious dish, she would certainly send part of it to our neighbors. In Palestine, if you greeted someone on your way, he would surely invite you to have lunch or to drink tea.</p><p>If there is joy, the whole family and neighbors will participate in it, but in the event of a death, you will find all the neighbors and relatives coming to console you, stand with you, and make food for you.</p><p>Palestinian women love embroidery, which is one of our most important heritage. I even learned it when I was 12 years old.</p><p><strong><em>What were/are some of the most difficult things you’ve had to deal with or currently have to deal with?</em></strong></p><p>There is another article I wrote about the war life, which you can read <a href="https://medium.com/i-am-palestine/the-war-life-54dd9c2241f0">here</a>.</p><p><strong><em>What are you most proud of as a Palestinian person?</em></strong></p><p>Palestinian person is a very loyal person. We loyal to our land and every chance we had we talked about it, and everyone of us dream about Palestine from river to sea!</p><p>And another thing I want to add, we like learning. The illiteracy rates in Palestine are among the lowest rates in the world (2.2% among individuals 15 years or more) for the year 2022.</p><p><strong><em>What’s one thing you’d like people to know about Palestinians?</em></strong></p><p>Everyone here is generous, and loves to honor his guest.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tl9saKfpJpVS7VcOAMuw1w.jpeg" /></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5a50fdd3a7df" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/i-am-palestine/my-life-in-gaza-5a50fdd3a7df">My Life in Gaza</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/i-am-palestine">I am Palestine</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I studied hard, worked while I studied, and depended on myself. I have good company at work and enjoy working while studying. At the weekend I usually spend the time with my friends, or reading books and do anything make me happy!</p><p>I graduated from the university and that was the best time of my life! I finally got less pressure and could do whatever I wanted after work since I had no more study at night!</p><p>On 6 October was my best friend’s birthday. We celebrated together, and had an amazing lunch and a tasty cake. While I was feeling so grateful, so happy and so satisfied I fell asleep that night. I woke up on the bombing and a lot of loud sounds that I already knew it!</p><p>Then it is the war! No work, no friends, just waiting your turn! Your turn to the bread queue, your turn to the water, your turn to charge your phone, and your turn to dead. I can’t tell you how I feel when I saw a lot of our neighbors are injured or dead, the way that everyone trying to help and waiting for the ambulance to take them to the hospital!</p><p>I tried to distract myself and not think about what would happen next, but I couldn’t. My heart was breaking when I saw the fear in my family’s eyes, especially my mother’s, she was horrified by what was happening. My brothers decided to sleep next to her as they were doing in every war to die together (if anything happened). My little brother saw about 5 wars and he is still 16!</p><p>At the end of November, a human truce happened and we thought this was the end of the war, and it turned into the hardest one.</p><p>One night in December, I can remember everything that happened that night. It was the worst night I had ever lived, my whole family woke up at 11pm because they bombed near to us. At the same time my mom got a call from her brother, he told her that their mother, their sister, their other brother, his wife, and their child died in that night because they bombed their neighbor’s house! We started crying!</p><p>Then at the same moment, our tears and sadness turned into fear and our life turned into Hell. They bombed everything around us, we heard the fire shooting and a lot of Quadcopter in the weather and it made everything move. I started screaming, my mom was trying to calm me down and the situation got worst when they targeting our street and a lot of soil filled our house. I slept that night with my tears and felt relaxed when I saw the morning.</p><p>Two weeks after that night, exactly at my birthday they asked me and my region to leave our homes. Can anyone imagine leaving your home — how could be? You should take what you can hold, just a bag! Can you collect your home in a bag, especially when you know you may not see that home again, someone can target it with your loved things, your warm bed, and your memories! And I can tell you this is another inside the main war.</p><p>I left my home with a broken heart, we went to Rafah, lived with 31 people in my mom’s aunt’s small house, and thank god we stayed at her home even though we barely found a place to sleep! This was the hardest time ever. My little brother got a Hepatitis A infection during our displacement because of the lack of clean water and good food, and my brother Ahmed had to stay up early and stand in a queue to get water for the whole family! That water could be for washing dishes, taking showers, cleaning the floor, cleaning the bathroom, washing clothes and cooking. It is a huge amount, and they had to carry it, btw. It is too heavy!</p><p>In more than 6 months, our life changed into a different life. No one can imagine or feel what we had to go through this time, and the problem is we don’t know when this will end!</p><p>Everyone in Gaza has their own story, and even when we tell it, it is incomplete. Everyone cares about their loved ones, so it is like a network, and everyone feels each other so you don’t feel sad just because of your story. You feel sad because of the story of everyone you loved, our hearts can’t endure more!</p><p>No words can describe the situation!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=54dd9c2241f0" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/i-am-palestine/the-war-life-54dd9c2241f0">The War Life</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/i-am-palestine">I am Palestine</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Reach out to me privately and I’ll make you a writer. Once you’re a writer, you can freely write stories and submit them for publication on this site. This is probably the most efficient option for both of us if you’d like to contribute multiple stories.</li><li><strong>Proxy Authoring</strong>: No need to interact with Medium.com, just email me your story and I’ll publish it for you in your name or anonymously, per your preference.</li><li><strong>Text Interview:</strong> Clone <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cktFnxaiw-Mt4GhlSasPrMiu_DYnipQ2j4F9UtBb0aw/edit?usp=sharing">this doc</a> containing a short list of interview questions, submit your answers and share it back with me. I’ll take care of publishing the interview in your name or anonymously, per your preference.</li><li><strong>Audio or Video Interview:</strong> I meet you via videoconference and record the audio, video, or both of a short interview where I ask you questions about your life and experiences. If you prefer anonymity, I’ll transcribe the audio or video into a text article and destroy the original recording. If you’re ok with being heard/seen, I’ll publish the audio/video (edited for time and clarity) <strong>but only after you approve the publication copy</strong>.</li></ol><p>If you’d like to contact me to submit a story, to be interviewed, or to ask any questions you might have, you can reach me via email at <strong>marc@mco.dev</strong>.</p><h3>Should I worry about being identified?</h3><p>Sadly, we live in a world in which antisemitism is increasingly weaponized against anyone who dares to criticize Israel. People have been harassed and jobs have been lost. If you have a story to tell but are concerned about retribution, I will do everything I can to protect your identify. All four options above include an anonymous authoring scenario. Note that option 1 above depends on medium.com protecting your identity. If you’re uncomfortable with that, I recommend options 2–4.</p><p>The fact that people have to fear simply telling the true story of their lives in their own names is a sad commentary on the state of repression and fear Palestinians have to endure.</p><h3>How do I know I can trust you?</h3><p>Options 2–4 avoid trusting medium.com but I can’t get around you having to trust me. If you have a story to share but are concerned about my trustworthiness (which I completely understand), I’m happy to meet with you by videoconference and will happily answer any questions you may have and give you a chance to get to know me and assess my sincerity and reliability for yourself.</p><h3>Who are you?</h3><p>I’m not myself Palestinian — I’m a Jewish American Google engineer living in London. Like many, I’m appalled not only by the genocide in Gaza, but also by the Apartheid regime and general oppression of the Palestinian people which Israel has perpetuated over the past 75 years.</p><p>Once you get to know someone, it’s harder to believe the propaganda you may have heard about them. I created this publication to make a safe place for Palestinians to tell their stories so that more people can get to know them and understand their history, their struggles, and their hopes and dreams.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6885bd21eda3" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/i-am-palestine/tell-us-your-story-6885bd21eda3">Tell us your story</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/i-am-palestine">I am Palestine</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*M8AeSALFijItMIFX" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@thisisengineering?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">ThisisEngineering RAEng</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>I’ve been teaching Python programming for several years and I’ve discovered some great tools and techniques to help students learn and to make the teacher’s life easier. Read on to learn the things I wished I knew when I started teaching.</p><h4>Jupyter what?</h4><p><a href="http://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a> is an open source software technology which enables authoring and executing interactive documents combining explanations and code. If you’ve not experienced this sort of computing tool before, the best way to get acquainted is to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15KAyGvriQwRoXQa3t70jmi3XumKBxDRi">try one</a>.</p><p>The notebook metaphor seems apt because you can save your work so you have a record of your learning session. But it’s really a turbo-charged notebook because you can access it from anywhere, you can copy and remix the original, add any additional code blocks or notes, and share it with the world.</p><h4>Ok, this is great but how do I make this available to my students?</h4><p>Once you realize the power of Jupyter Notebooks, your next question will probably be “how do I setup a service so my students can use this tool?”. In the bad old days, the answer was something like this:</p><ul><li>acquire some hardware</li><li>install some software</li><li>configure and administer everything</li><li>deal with it when it breaks</li></ul><p>Congratulations — you’re a system administrator!</p><p>Fortunately, nowadays we have cloud services that can make your life much easier. Since this is the Google Colab blog, that’s the service I’m going to focus on in this article, though you should know there are other good Notebooks servieces out there. Colab provides free cloud hosted Jupyter notebooks for everyone. I like to think of Colab as “Google Docs for Jupyter” because, like Docs, the service is free, it stores your work for safekeeping, and it gives you the ability to share your creations with anyone.</p><h4>How do I use it?</h4><p>This is the best part. Whether you’re a teacher or a student, your journey starts the same way: just click on a link. You’ll be able to create a new notebook, run someone else’s notebook (or one of your own), share a notebook with others, etc. All via your favorite web browser.</p><p>Let’s imagine today’s the first day of your Python Programming 101 course. An inquisitive student raises her hand and earnestly asks: “Professor, what software do we need to install?”. You can barely contain your giddiness in responding: “There’s nothing to intall; we’ll be doing all our coursework in a web browser. Let me show you an example.” Doesn’t that feel great?</p><p>Hopefully you now understand, at a high level, how Colab can help you in the classroom. Stay tuned for Part 2, in which we’ll see some more concrete, practical tips, like using Colab for your lecture and review notes, your homework assignments, and your learning assessments.</p><p>Are you using Colab in the classroom? Please add a comment below describing your experience.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b988ab309d11" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

The learning advantages of the young mind are well established, particularly in the area of language acquisition. But in some dimensions, we may actually learn better at a more advanced age.</p><p>If you know about Kahneman’s theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">fast and slow thinking</a>, it seems to me that the younger brain’s fast thinking engine has a significant advantage, while the older brain’s slow thinking facilities are likely more refined.</p><p>The article below relates the story of a father who set out to teach his young daughter how to play chess, while learning the game himself, at the same time. An excerpt I found poignant:</p><blockquote><em>…but there was the look in her eyes as I checkmated her a second time. For whatever the games had taught me about brains young and old, about the different ways we learn and deploy our cognitive resources, they also taught me that the only thing harder than losing to your daughter in chess is winning against her.</em></blockquote><p>This article reminded me of my own experience teaching my daughter the game of chess, which is captured in the photo above.</p><blockquote><em>What I learned trying to keep up with my 4-year-old daughter at the royal game. @NautilusMag </em><a href="http://nautil.us/issue/36/aging/learning-chess-at-40"><em>http://nautil.us/issue/36/aging/learning-chess-at-40</em></a></blockquote><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href="https://mco.dev/learning-chess-at-four-and-forty/"><em>https://mco.dev</em></a><em> on November 22, 2020.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=55f46f56787f" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

Something analogous happened thirty years ago when, on January 15, 1990, the entire US long-distance telephone network crashed for nine hours.</p><blockquote><em>This was a strange, dire, huge event. During the nine long hours of frantic effort that it took to restore service, some seventy million telephone calls went uncompleted.</em></blockquote><p>I was working at Bell Labs at the time, which was a subsidiary of AT&amp;T. Limited and isoated failures, akin to modern outages in your ISP’s internet service, were relatively common in those days, however, this sort of ubiquitous and sustained service breakdown taking out the entire network was unprecedented.</p><blockquote><em>Bell Labs engineers, working feverishly in New Jersey, Illinois, and Ohio, first tried their entire repertoire of standard network remedies on the malfunctioning System 7. None of the remedies worked, of course, because nothing like this had ever happened to any phone system before.</em></blockquote><p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the story: the crash of Janurary 15, which happened to be Martin Luther King Day, was not caused by Russian agents, cybercriminals, or hackers. <strong>The entire calamity was caused by one line of errant code, written by one very unlucky programmer.</strong></p><blockquote><em>As it happened, the problem itself — the problem per se — took this form. A piece of telco software had been written in C language, a standard language of the telco field. Within the C software was a long “do… while” construct. The “do… while” construct contained a “switch” statement. The “switch” statement contained an “if” clause. The “if” clause contained a “break.” The “break” was supposed to “break” the “if clause.” Instead, the “break” broke the “switch” statement.</em></blockquote><p>Read the whole amazing story in the article linked below.</p><blockquote><em>On January 15, 1990, AT&amp;T’s long-distance telephone switching system crashed. </em><a href="http://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html"><em>http://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html</em></a></blockquote><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href="https://mco.dev/the-big-crash/"><em>https://mco.dev</em></a><em> on November 19, 2020.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d68599693e22" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

But it’s pretty easy to crunch the numbers because it has only 22 counties.</p><p>Nearly all of those counties are red except for Clark and Washoe, which are by far the largest in population. All you have to do is extrapolate the remaining votes, on a per county basis, to break the same way the existing votes have gone.</p><p>One pitfall here is timing bias, i.e., the later counted votes within a county may be distributed differently than those counted earlier. That’s quite possible if they are comprised of a differently distributed category (e.g. mail-in vs. in-person, early vs. later received absentee ballots, etc.).</p><p>According to the New York Times, “Remaining votes include mail ballots received on Election Day, those that will arrive over the next week and provisional ballots.”. So they’ll likely skew a bit but it’s not obvious in which direction. And 86% is a pretty good sample size.</p><p>The calculation below does this simple per-county extrapolation. My projected shares of the total may be off a bit due to excluding the effect of the two other party candidates, but the relative difference should be the same: Biden will win Nevada by about 1%.</p><p>I can’t seem to embed the spreadsheet in Medium but check my original post to see the calculation details: <a href="https://mco.dev/biden-will-win-nevada-by-1/">https://mco.dev/biden-will-win-nevada-by-1/</a>.</p><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href="https://mco.dev/biden-will-win-nevada-by-1/"><em>https://mco.dev</em></a><em> on November 5, 2020.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f36b79ba29a1" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>
