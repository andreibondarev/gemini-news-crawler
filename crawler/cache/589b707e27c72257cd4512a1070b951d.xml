            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*OlwfMbJnL6tW-bAo" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@maxsaeling?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Max Saeling</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3>What is this?</h3><p>This publication is a repository of Palestinians’ stories told in their own voices, in the form of text, audio, and video.</p><h3>Why is it needed?</h3><p>A <a href="https://www.972mag.com/us-media-palestinians/">study</a> by the University of Arizona’s Maha Nassar found that of the opinion articles about Palestinians published in The New York Times and The Washington Post between 2000 and 2009, Palestinians themselves wrote roughly 1 percent (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/opinion/israel-american-jews-zionism.html?campaign_id=39&amp;emc=edit_ty_20240323&amp;instance_id=118291&amp;nl=opinion-today&amp;regi_id=72982178&amp;segment_id=161582&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=2cd37a855f14f318a21bf53c9729ed28">source</a>). <strong>This needs to change.</strong></p><h3>How can I share my story?</h3><p>You have a few options:</p><ol><li><strong>Medium Authoring</strong>: Create an account on Medium.com (make it anonymous if you prefer not to be identified). Reach out to me privately and I’ll make you a writer. Once you’re a writer, you can freely write stories and submit them for publication on this site. This is probably the most efficient option for both of us if you’d like to contribute multiple stories.</li><li><strong>Proxy Authoring</strong>: No need to interact with Medium.com, just email me your story and I’ll publish it for you in your name or anonymously, per your preference.</li><li><strong>Text Interview:</strong> Clone <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cktFnxaiw-Mt4GhlSasPrMiu_DYnipQ2j4F9UtBb0aw/edit?usp=sharing">this doc</a> containing a short list of interview questions, submit your answers and share it back with me. I’ll take care of publishing the interview in your name or anonymously, per your preference.</li><li><strong>Audio or Video Interview:</strong> I meet you via videoconference and record the audio, video, or both of a short interview where I ask you questions about your life and experiences. If you prefer anonymity, I’ll transcribe the audio or video into a text article and destroy the original recording. If you’re ok with being heard/seen, I’ll publish the audio/video (edited for time and clarity) <strong>but only after you approve the publication copy</strong>.</li></ol><p>If you’d like to contact me to submit a story, to be interviewed, or to ask any questions you might have, you can reach me via email at <strong>marc@mco.dev</strong>.</p><h3>Should I worry about being identified?</h3><p>Sadly, we live in a world in which antisemitism is increasingly weaponized against anyone who dares to criticize Israel. People have been harassed and jobs have been lost. If you have a story to tell but are concerned about retribution, I will do everything I can to protect your identify. All four options above include an anonymous authoring scenario. Note that option 1 above depends on medium.com protecting your identity. If you’re uncomfortable with that, I recommend options 2–4.</p><p>The fact that people have to fear simply telling the true story of their lives in their own names is a sad commentary on the state of repression and fear Palestinians have to endure.</p><h3>How do I know I can trust you?</h3><p>Options 2–4 avoid trusting medium.com but I can’t get around you having to trust me. If you have a story to share but are concerned about my trustworthiness (which I completely understand), I’m happy to meet with you by videoconference and will happily answer any questions you may have and give you a chance to get to know me and assess my sincerity and reliability for yourself.</p><h3>Who are you?</h3><p>I’m not myself Palestinian — I’m a Jewish American Google engineer living in London. Like many, I’m appalled not only by the genocide in Gaza, but also by the Apartheid regime and general oppression of the Palestinian people which Israel has perpetuated over the past 75 years.</p><p>Once you get to know someone, it’s harder to believe the propaganda you may have heard about them. I created this publication to make a safe place for Palestinians to tell their stories so that more people can get to know them and understand their history, their struggles, and their hopes and dreams.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6885bd21eda3" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/i-am-palestine/tell-us-your-story-6885bd21eda3">Tell us your story</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/i-am-palestine">I am Palestine</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*M8AeSALFijItMIFX" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@thisisengineering?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">ThisisEngineering RAEng</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>I’ve been teaching Python programming for several years and I’ve discovered some great tools and techniques to help students learn and to make the teacher’s life easier. Read on to learn the things I wished I knew when I started teaching.</p><h4>Jupyter what?</h4><p><a href="http://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a> is an open source software technology which enables authoring and executing interactive documents combining explanations and code. If you’ve not experienced this sort of computing tool before, the best way to get acquainted is to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15KAyGvriQwRoXQa3t70jmi3XumKBxDRi">try one</a>.</p><p>The notebook metaphor seems apt because you can save your work so you have a record of your learning session. But it’s really a turbo-charged notebook because you can access it from anywhere, you can copy and remix the original, add any additional code blocks or notes, and share it with the world.</p><h4>Ok, this is great but how do I make this available to my students?</h4><p>Once you realize the power of Jupyter Notebooks, your next question will probably be “how do I setup a service so my students can use this tool?”. In the bad old days, the answer was something like this:</p><ul><li>acquire some hardware</li><li>install some software</li><li>configure and administer everything</li><li>deal with it when it breaks</li></ul><p>Congratulations — you’re a system administrator!</p><p>Fortunately, nowadays we have cloud services that can make your life much easier. Since this is the Google Colab blog, that’s the service I’m going to focus on in this article, though you should know there are other good Notebooks servieces out there. Colab provides free cloud hosted Jupyter notebooks for everyone. I like to think of Colab as “Google Docs for Jupyter” because, like Docs, the service is free, it stores your work for safekeeping, and it gives you the ability to share your creations with anyone.</p><h4>How do I use it?</h4><p>This is the best part. Whether you’re a teacher or a student, your journey starts the same way: just click on a link. You’ll be able to create a new notebook, run someone else’s notebook (or one of your own), share a notebook with others, etc. All via your favorite web browser.</p><p>Let’s imagine today’s the first day of your Python Programming 101 course. An inquisitive student raises her hand and earnestly asks: “Professor, what software do we need to install?”. You can barely contain your giddiness in responding: “There’s nothing to intall; we’ll be doing all our coursework in a web browser. Let me show you an example.” Doesn’t that feel great?</p><p>Hopefully you now understand, at a high level, how Colab can help you in the classroom. Stay tuned for Part 2, in which we’ll see some more concrete, practical tips, like using Colab for your lecture and review notes, your homework assignments, and your learning assessments.</p><p>Are you using Colab in the classroom? Please add a comment below describing your experience.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b988ab309d11" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

The learning advantages of the young mind are well established, particularly in the area of language acquisition. But in some dimensions, we may actually learn better at a more advanced age.</p><p>If you know about Kahneman’s theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">fast and slow thinking</a>, it seems to me that the younger brain’s fast thinking engine has a significant advantage, while the older brain’s slow thinking facilities are likely more refined.</p><p>The article below relates the story of a father who set out to teach his young daughter how to play chess, while learning the game himself, at the same time. An excerpt I found poignant:</p><blockquote><em>…but there was the look in her eyes as I checkmated her a second time. For whatever the games had taught me about brains young and old, about the different ways we learn and deploy our cognitive resources, they also taught me that the only thing harder than losing to your daughter in chess is winning against her.</em></blockquote><p>This article reminded me of my own experience teaching my daughter the game of chess, which is captured in the photo above.</p><blockquote><em>What I learned trying to keep up with my 4-year-old daughter at the royal game. @NautilusMag </em><a href="http://nautil.us/issue/36/aging/learning-chess-at-40"><em>http://nautil.us/issue/36/aging/learning-chess-at-40</em></a></blockquote><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href="https://mco.dev/learning-chess-at-four-and-forty/"><em>https://mco.dev</em></a><em> on November 22, 2020.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=55f46f56787f" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

Something analogous happened thirty years ago when, on January 15, 1990, the entire US long-distance telephone network crashed for nine hours.</p><blockquote><em>This was a strange, dire, huge event. During the nine long hours of frantic effort that it took to restore service, some seventy million telephone calls went uncompleted.</em></blockquote><p>I was working at Bell Labs at the time, which was a subsidiary of AT&amp;T. Limited and isoated failures, akin to modern outages in your ISP’s internet service, were relatively common in those days, however, this sort of ubiquitous and sustained service breakdown taking out the entire network was unprecedented.</p><blockquote><em>Bell Labs engineers, working feverishly in New Jersey, Illinois, and Ohio, first tried their entire repertoire of standard network remedies on the malfunctioning System 7. None of the remedies worked, of course, because nothing like this had ever happened to any phone system before.</em></blockquote><p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the story: the crash of Janurary 15, which happened to be Martin Luther King Day, was not caused by Russian agents, cybercriminals, or hackers. <strong>The entire calamity was caused by one line of errant code, written by one very unlucky programmer.</strong></p><blockquote><em>As it happened, the problem itself — the problem per se — took this form. A piece of telco software had been written in C language, a standard language of the telco field. Within the C software was a long “do… while” construct. The “do… while” construct contained a “switch” statement. The “switch” statement contained an “if” clause. The “if” clause contained a “break.” The “break” was supposed to “break” the “if clause.” Instead, the “break” broke the “switch” statement.</em></blockquote><p>Read the whole amazing story in the article linked below.</p><blockquote><em>On January 15, 1990, AT&amp;T’s long-distance telephone switching system crashed. </em><a href="http://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html"><em>http://www.mit.edu/hacker/part1.html</em></a></blockquote><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href="https://mco.dev/the-big-crash/"><em>https://mco.dev</em></a><em> on November 19, 2020.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d68599693e22" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

But it’s pretty easy to crunch the numbers because it has only 22 counties.</p><p>Nearly all of those counties are red except for Clark and Washoe, which are by far the largest in population. All you have to do is extrapolate the remaining votes, on a per county basis, to break the same way the existing votes have gone.</p><p>One pitfall here is timing bias, i.e., the later counted votes within a county may be distributed differently than those counted earlier. That’s quite possible if they are comprised of a differently distributed category (e.g. mail-in vs. in-person, early vs. later received absentee ballots, etc.).</p><p>According to the New York Times, “Remaining votes include mail ballots received on Election Day, those that will arrive over the next week and provisional ballots.”. So they’ll likely skew a bit but it’s not obvious in which direction. And 86% is a pretty good sample size.</p><p>The calculation below does this simple per-county extrapolation. My projected shares of the total may be off a bit due to excluding the effect of the two other party candidates, but the relative difference should be the same: Biden will win Nevada by about 1%.</p><p>I can’t seem to embed the spreadsheet in Medium but check my original post to see the calculation details: <a href="https://mco.dev/biden-will-win-nevada-by-1/">https://mco.dev/biden-will-win-nevada-by-1/</a>.</p><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href="https://mco.dev/biden-will-win-nevada-by-1/"><em>https://mco.dev</em></a><em> on November 5, 2020.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f36b79ba29a1" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

Here’s how to fix that, and a few other problems along the way.</p><p>Under FDR’s leadership, the federal government pulled the United States out of the Great Depression, in part, by funding ambitious public works projects, like building our vast interstate highway system. Now we’re in the midst of another severe depression, calling for another round of big thinking and big investment.</p><p>What better priority to focus on than building a network of high speed, clean energy trains. Such an infrastructure would be a triple win:</p><ol><li>revolutionize transportation in the US,</li><li>drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and</li><li>create a vast array of new jobs.</li></ol><p>I know what you’re saying — dream on, Marc, that’ll never happen. But check out the article below about major advances by a Dutch company, promising safe, clean, and efficient 600 mph trains. Can you imagine what we could accomplish by focusing our resources on this problem with the same intensity we brought to sending a man to the Moon?</p><p>A 600 mpg train would enable travel from New York to Washington D.C. in thirty minutes and a cross country journey in four hours.</p><p>After Joe Biden takes the oath of office, this should be a domestic priority. I can’t think of a better way to restart our economy, reduce our collective climate footprint, and build something of lasting value for future generations.</p><blockquote><em>Plans for a new form of transportation are well underway, suggesting that by 2040 we might have a more efficient and environmentally friendly way to travel. (</em><a href="https://matadornetwork.com/read/futuristic-capsule-transportation-will-link-paris-amsterdam-fast/"><em>source</em></a><em>)</em></blockquote><p><em>Visit </em><a href="https://mco.dev"><em>mco.dev</em></a><em> or subscribe to my </em><a href="https://tinyletter.com/mco"><em>newsletter</em></a><em> for more stories like this.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4c3faf0b27f2" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

You bring the world right to my fingertips. And you’re always there for me. Unfortunately, I’m a little too into you.</p><p>I found myself spending more and more of my time focusing on you rather than the world around me. It got to the point where I would put you down and then seconds later find you were back in my hand, without even realizing I’d picked you up again.</p><p>Lately, most of the time we spend together is not quality time. It’s just bouncing around between my favorite apps and websites, waiting for that little dopamine hit that comes from finding an interesting news item or something cool in my twitter feed. But think about the opportunity cost of all that time spent staring at my hand.</p><p>I’ve suspected our relationship was unhealthy for few years and I’ve tried so many methods to manage our time together. But I keep coming back to you. So I started wondering, what’s the minimal set of functions I need at my fingertips 24x7?</p><ul><li>make and receive voice calls</li><li>send and receive text messages</li><li>take pictures</li></ul><p>That’s it. That’s all I really want from a device in my pocket. What about email? I can do that on my laptop. Google, New York Times, online chess? Same answer. Facebook? I quit years ago. Instagram, TikTok? No thanks.</p><p>So I disabled your wifi and cellular data and removed all but the three apps above. I even removed Chrome. I know that hurt your feelings but I’ve decided to put a priority on my productivity and wellbeing.</p><p>I know what you’re thinking. How can I possibly survive without you? Remember this: I lived most of my life in the pre-smart-phone era and I did pretty well. I read books, I talked with people, and I thought deeply about things.</p><p>This song says it more eloquently than I could:</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FGHnfcd_k2O4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGHnfcd_k2O4&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FGHnfcd_k2O4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/7f145746c671133d687969530bd4d5f3/href">https://medium.com/media/7f145746c671133d687969530bd4d5f3/href</a></iframe><p>I know this is a cliche but it’s true: It’s not you, smartphone, it’s me. You’re a wonderful piece of technology but I want more out of life than you can give me.</p><p>Yours truly,<br> Marc</p><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href="https://mco.dev/its-not-you-its-me/"><em>https://mco.dev</em></a><em> on July 24, 2020.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=393aa199de5b" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Processing 10TB of Wikipedia Page Views — Part 2</h3><h3>Data Visualization</h3><p>This is the second of a two part series in which we focus on interesting queries and visualizations using the data pipeline we created in part one.</p><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/@marcacohen/processing-10tb-of-wikipedia-page-views-part-1-b984d8ebe146">part one</a>, we covered the problem statement and the data engineering solution, including all the code needed to build a reliable, robust big data processing pipeline. In this part two, we’ll cover some of the fun things we can do once we have our data pipeline running: interesting queries and data visualizations and a Data Studio dashboard you can try yourself.</p><h3>What can we do with this data?</h3><p>For starters, let’s find out the most popular Wikipedia article so far this year:</p><pre>SELECT title, SUM(views) total_views <br>  FROM `bigquery-public-data.wikipedia.pageviews_2020` <br>WHERE wiki IN (&#39;en&#39;, &#39;en.m&#39;) <br>  AND title NOT IN (&#39;Main_Page&#39;,&#39;-&#39;,&#39;Wikipedia&#39;)<br>  AND title NOT LIKE &#39;File%&#39; <br>  AND title NOT LIKE &#39;Special:%&#39; <br>  AND title NOT LIKE &#39;Portal:%&#39; <br>  AND datehour&gt;=&#39;2020-01-01&#39; <br>  AND views&gt;10000 <br>GROUP BY title <br>ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 10</pre><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/736/0*4hAkF4gIf7ywHm-D.png" /></figure><h3>It’s only rock &amp; roll, but I like it</h3><p>That last query was interesting but it doesn’t take advantage of the entity data we worked so hard to process in part 1. Let’s construct an example leveraging our wikidata table to find the most viewed pages for rock bands in 2020. Of course, this begs the question, what is a rock band? Wikidata to the rescue!</p><p>You can search the wikidata interactively via the wikidata site, like this:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*KfBEsxFKc9O3Cuek.png" /></figure><p>This shows us that “rock band” matches multiple entities, including the video game of the same name. The entity we’re after is the first one: 5741069. One way to confirm this finding is to search for a known entity that should be in this category:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/912/0*-OYfCkstAhM2C3us.png" /></figure><p>Here we see that the preeminent rock band, The Beatles, is indeed classified as an instance of “Rock Band”. But this doesn’t catch every page I’m interested. For example, Radiohead is considered an instance of “Musical Group” (215380).</p><p>Armed with those two entity ids, we can now do some queries about popular bands. But I want to do one more thing before we start querying. Since our scope is limited to just those two entities, it’s wasteful to search the full 10TB dataset on every query. Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a way to limit our search to include only the pages we care about? Well, there is — we’ll create what BigQuery calls a view, which will limit our query scope to only the view counts for pages about bands.</p><p>Here’s the SQL code to create my view, which I’ve made public so you can try it too:</p><pre>CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `mco-bigquery.wikipedia.bands`<br>(datehour TIMESTAMP, title STRING, views INT64) <br>PARTITION BY DATE(datehour)<br>CLUSTER BY title <br>AS   <br>  SELECT datehour, title, SUM(views) views<br>  FROM `bigquery-public-data.wikipedia.pageviews_*` a<br>  JOIN (<br>    SELECT DISTINCT en_wiki<br>    FROM `bigquery-public-data.wikipedia.wikidata`<br>    WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM UNNEST(instance_of) WHERE numeric_id=5741069 or numeric_id=215380)<br>    AND en_wiki IS NOT null   <br>  ) b <br>ON a.title=b.en_wiki<br>AND a.wiki=&#39;en&#39; <br>AND DATE(a.datehour) BETWEEN &#39;2015-01-01&#39; AND &#39;2020-12-31&#39; <br>GROUP BY datehour, title</pre><p>This view gives us a dataset we can query much more quickly and economically, because we’re only scanning information associated with bands, which is a small subset of the overall dataset.</p><p>Let’s find the most wiki-popular band so far in 2020 with this query:</p><pre>SELECT title, SUM(views) views <br>FROM `mco-bigquery.wikipedia.bands` <br>WHERE DATE(datehour) BETWEEN &quot;2020-01-01&quot; AND &quot;2020-12-31&quot; <br>GROUP BY title <br>ORDER BY views DESC <br>LIMIT 10</pre><p>And the results as of this writing…</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/510/0*K5c2m4fVSfCaFgoW.png" /></figure><h3>Let’s make a dashboard!</h3><p>This is fun but:</p><ol><li>It’s a snapshot of a single moment — it doesn’t give us any sense of how this data varies over time.</li><li>SQL queries can be a bit complicated, especially for beginners.</li><li>This query is interactive for me but I’d like to somehow share that interactivity with others.</li></ol><p>Wouldn’t it be nice if I could easily, without writing a single line of code, allow everyone to query this data, with mouse clicks rather than SQL queries, and to see the results in a nice color coded time series graph?</p><p>Using <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/overview">Google Data Studio</a>, I made just such a dashboard, which I’ve embeded below. Give it a try — you can play with the selected bands and the time frame you’d like to analyse.</p><p>For example, I wonder which band, during the last five years, was more popular: the Beatles or the Stones? We can use this dashboard to find out in just a few seconds:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*BDsdoG9_Uj8csp1n.png" /></figure><p>Despite having ended their career fifty years ago, the Beatles continue to gather a pretty impressive level of attention in Wikipedia page views.</p><h3>Now it’s your turn</h3><p>I’ve made this data available to everyone in the BigQuery Public Dataset collection. The page views are coming in roughly every hour and the entity data gets refreshed every 3–4 days. The data can be found in the bigquery-public-data collection, under Wikipedia, as shown below:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Y0WQm06l-plYB90i.png" /></figure><p>These tables are partitioned so you can save time and cost by time limiting your queries, like this:</p><pre>SELECT title, SUM(views) views FROM `bigquery-public-data.wikipedia.pageviews_2019` WHERE DATE(datehour) BETWEEN &quot;2019-01-01&quot; AND &quot;2019-12-31&quot; AND wiki = &#39;en&#39; GROUP BY title ORDER BY views DESC LIMIT 20</pre><p>The “Battle of the Bands” dashboard is also available for your use at <a href="https://mco.fyi/bands">mco.fyi/bands</a>.</p><h3>Resources and Acknowledgements</h3><ul><li><a href="https://medium.com/@marcacohen/processing-10tb-of-wikipedia-page-views-part-1-b984d8ebe146">Part 1</a> of this series</li><li>All of the code described in this article can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/marcacohen/wikidata">github.com/marcacohen/wikidata</a>.</li><li>Many thanks to <a href="https://medium.com/@hoffa">Felipe Hoffa</a>.
