            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Codelab: Using Gemini Code Assist to explore and enhance Generative AI Document Summarization Jump Start Solution</h3><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/all-jss-guides">Google Cloud Jump Start solutions</a> are <strong>pre-built sample applications</strong> and <strong>infrastructure best-practices </strong>that you can <strong>deploy within a few clicks</strong> <strong>in your own Google Cloud account.</strong></p><blockquote><em>If you would like an introduction to Jump Start Solutions, check out my blog post titled </em><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/super-charge-your-google-cloud-learning-with-jump-start-solutions-cfe7160eb41f"><em>Super charge your Google Cloud Learning with Jump Start Solutions</em></a><em>.</em></blockquote><p>This post is focused on a codelab that you can do for the following:</p><ol><li>Understand one of the Jump Start Solutions — <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/gemini/code-assist">Generative AI Document Summarization</a></li><li>Use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/gemini/code-assist">Gemini Code Assist</a> to help you understand the code and develop a new feature in the Jump Start Solution.</li></ol><h3>Generative AI Documentation Summarization — The solution</h3><p>As the Jump Start solution documentation states, “This solution leverages Vertex AI Generative AI Large Language Models (LLM) to process and summarize documents on demand.”</p><p>This solution deploys a pipeline that is triggered when you add a new PDF document to your <strong>Cloud Storage</strong> bucket. The pipeline extracts text from your document (<strong>using Vision API OCR feature</strong>), creates a summary (via a <strong>Vertex AI LLM model</strong>) from the extracted text, and stores the summary in a database (<strong>BigQuery</strong>) for you to view and search.</p><p>You can read more on the official documentation <a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/ai-ml/generative-ai-document-summarization">here</a> but first the architecture diagram, which will make things more clear. Focus on the blocks outlined in red color, since the codelab is focused on that.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PJUmu6-DOymnG-2EPr6niw.png" /></figure><p>You can see from the flow that trigger and summarization of the document is a manual process. You have to trigger it by uploading a PDF into the specific Cloud Storage bucket and then the Cloud Function gets triggered, which will extract the Text from the document, summarize and write the results to both Cloud Storage and BigQuery.</p><p>The codelab that you can execute to understand this existing solution, do a sample run and then develop a new functionality is available here:</p><p><a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/gemini-code-assist-developer-aisummarization-jss">Using Gemini Code Assist to explore and enhance AI Summarization Jump Start Solution | Google Codelabs</a></p><p>As part of the codelab, you will setup Gemini Code Assist, an AI assistant available in Google Cloud, that will allow you to inspect the source code for the solution, take assistance to understand some parts of the code via the “Explain this” prompt and more. <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/gemini-code-assist-developer-aisummarization-jss?hl=en#5"><strong>(Step 6 in the codelab)</strong></a></p><p>The codelab also contains steps to do a manual execution of the flow via a sample PDF (Research paper). <strong>(</strong><a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/gemini-code-assist-developer-aisummarization-jss?hl=en#6"><strong>Step 7 in the codelab</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p><h3>Use Gemini Code Assist to develop new functionality</h3><p>As mentioned, the Jump Start Solution presents a manual process i.e. you have to upload the sample PDF to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Our goal is to take this further and develop new functionality i.e. <strong>build out a web front-end that allows you to upload the file that needs to be summarized.</strong></p><p>To build out this functionality, you will need to do the following at a high level:</p><ol><li>Develop the Web assets (HTML, Javascript, CSS) for the upload form.</li><li>Build out a server side functionality that will accept the uploaded file, extract out the contents and the use Google Cloud Storage client APIs to write the object blob to the Google Cloud Storage bucket.</li></ol><p>How about using Gemini Code Assist to help you out with source code that can speed up the development of the above functionality? That is exactly what is demonstrated in the codelab. <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/gemini-code-assist-developer-aisummarization-jss?hl=en#7"><strong>(Step 8 in the codelab)</strong></a></p><h3>Bonus</h3><p>The codelab also utilizes Code Assist to demonstrate how you can work with it to get information on:</p><ul><li>Deploying the application you developed to Cloud Run</li><li>Enhance the Web application by throwing in some CSS Styling</li></ul><p>Hope you enjoy the codelab. Use this codelab to understand the process of taking any existing solution and using Code Assist to understand the source code and incrementally enhance the application.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=28c410042544" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/codelab-using-gemini-code-assist-to-explore-and-enhance-generative-ai-document-summarization-jump-28c410042544">Codelab: Using Gemini Code Assist to explore and enhance Generative AI Document Summarization Jump…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud">Google Cloud - Community</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Google Cloud Platform — Technology Nuggets : April 16–30, 2024 Edition</h3><p>Welcome to the April 16–30, 2024 edition of Google Cloud Platform Technology Nuggets.</p><p>Please feel free to give <a href="https://forms.gle/UAsAS7YLxYSBTNBy9">feedback</a> on this issue and share the <a href="https://gcptechnuggets.substack.com/">subscription form</a> with your peers.</p><h3>Google Cloud Next 2024</h3><p>A final reminder that sessions from Google Cloud NEXT 2024 are all available on demand at the Cloud NEXT ’24 site. The only requirement is that you will need to register to view the sessions. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next">entire session library</a> from the conference.</p><h3>Infrastructure</h3><p>Connectivity is key to long term economic and productivity gains. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/pacific-connect-initiative-to-expand">post</a> that captures that details on the $1 billion investment in digital connectivity to Japan, that includes expansion of the Pacific Connect Initiative and two new subsea cables, Proa and Taihei.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*bC2NGcNVrSk1N6pC.png" /></figure><p>Regional Persistent Disk is a storage option that lets you implement high availability (HA) services in Compute Engine. Regional Persistent Disk synchronously replicate data between two zones in the same region and ensure HA for disk data for up to one zonal failure. Its is best designed for workloads that require a lower RTO and RPO. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/using-regional-persistent-disks-for-highly-available-workloads">blog post</a> that helps you to learn more about Regional Persistent Disk, including its features, setting it up and more.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*4f-5hwfceO-hqyZx.jpg" /></figure><h3>Containers and Kubernetes</h3><p>If you are in the Telecom domain and looking to adopt Kubernetes, one of the key challenges/requirements has been addressing multi-networking requirements within the domain, especially around strict network isolation and maximizing performance to achieve the high throughput and low latency requirements. This <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/telecommunications/telecom-applications-on-kubernetes-with-multi-networking">blog post</a> is an essential read that highlights critical telecom use cases enabled by multi-networking.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*QYrWrW1BX3QYXfGF.png" /></figure><p>Each Pod in Kubernetes has its own network address. As the blog post states, “With every Pod in every cluster being allocated IPs on the same VPC, and allowing space in those ranges for expansion, IPs get used very fast.” How do you solve this problem with IPv4 ranges today? Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/best-practices-for-kubernetes-pod-ip-allocation-in-gke">solution</a>.</p><p>Hyperdisk is Google Cloud’s next-generation block storage service that allows you to modify your capacity, throughput, and IOPS-related performance and tailor it to your workloads, without having to re-deploy your entire stack. Hyperdisk Balanced has just been announced, which sort of lies in the middle with Hyperdisk Throughput and Hyperdisk Extreme. Hyperdisk Balance is “General-purpose volume type that is the best fit for most workloads, with up to 2.4GBps of throughput and 160k IOPS. Ideal for line-of-business applications, web applications, databases, or boot disks.”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1jwsYvHeQlweHSSw0yJ9cg.png" /></figure><p>Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/hyperdisk-balanced-for-gke-now-available">blog post</a> on read more on this and getting started with Hyperdisk on GKE.</p><h3>Networking</h3><p>Direct Peering enables you to establish a direct peering connection between your business network and Google’s edge network and exchange high-throughput cloud traffic. Direct Peering requires complex routing designs and as a result, not all customers are interesting in managing that. At the same time, the need to achieve low-latency and highly-available connectivity is a given. Enter Verified Peering Provider (VPP) program, that simplifies connectivity to Google’s network.</p><p>As the blog post states, “The Verified Peering Provider program identifies ISPs that offer enterprise-grade internet services and have met multiple technical requirements, including diverse peering connectivity to Google. Information about each Verified Peering Provider, such as their Google network connectivity locations, redundancy information and markets where they offer internet services, are listed on Google’s <a href="https://peering.google.com/#/options/verified-peering-provider">website</a>.”</p><p>Read the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/verified-peering-provider-simplifies-enterprise-connectivity">blog post</a> for more details and check out a list of Verified Peering Providers <a href="https://peering.google.com/#/options/verified-peering-provider">here</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*T_vDGF3NweTrTLXV.png" /></figure><p>Direct VPC egress is now in general availability (GA) for Cloud Run. This allows your Cloud Run resources to send traffic directly to a VPC network without proxying it through Serverless VPC Access connectors. As the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/direct-vpc-egress-for-cloud-run-is-now-ga">blog post</a> states “It delivers approximately <strong>twice the throughput</strong> compared to both VPC connectors and the default Cloud Run internet egress path, offering up to 1 GB per second per instance.”</p><h3>Identity and Security</h3><p>Gemini 1.5 Pro, with its processing capability upto 1 million tokens is an excellent tool to help with Automated Malware Analysis. In a detailed <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/gemini-for-malware-analysis">blog post</a>, that is an essential read for Security professionals, the authors provided code and a simple prompt to Gemini 1.5 Pro, to determine if the file was malicious, and to provide a list of activities and indicators of compromise. The result: Gemini 1.5 Pro was accurate to check for malware, generate summary reports and determination of code. The post goes into detail about Malware Analysis, how Gemini 1.5 Pro performed and most importantly, the fact that it is able to handle the large context window played a key role in its accuracy v/s other tools that required chunking and assembling.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*8v1M0Jryqh0RhZHm.png" /></figure><p>Regulatory, Compliance and Sovereignity needs are important for customers as they run various types of workloads in the Cloud. To help simplify and manage these requirements, several announcements were made at Cloud NEXT 2024, which included new Regional Control and Google Cloud Partners that are providing Sovereign controls to address regional requirements. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/the-power-of-choice-empowering-your-regulatory-and-compliance-journey">blog post</a> for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/336/0*R2enqC66Js76bxug.png" /></figure><h3>Machine Learning</h3><p>Meta Llama 3 is available now on Vertex AI Model Garden. Acessing Llama 3 through Vertex AI, allows access to tuning options made available through Colab Enterprise. These include preconfigured notebooks for supervised tuning (LoRA), reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF), and distillation. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/meta-llama-3-available-today-on-google-cloud-vertex-ai">blog post</a> for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*T3JhosJhSdSZ0fn0.png" /></figure><p>For ML Practitioners using PyTorch/XLA, a new release 2.3 is out, which brings productivity, performance and usability improvements. Official PyTorch/XLA repository is available at <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/xla">https://github.com/pytorch/xla</a>. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/introducing-pytorch-xla-2-3">post</a> for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*CGTRKPr68dJwgDb-.png" /></figure><h3>Storage and Data Transfer</h3><p>Continuing with Hyperdisk Storage, a Hyperdisk Storage Pool is a pre-purchased collection of capacity, throughput, and IOPS which you can then provision to your applications as needed. A Hyperdisk Storage Pool helps you lower your block storage TCO in two ways: It leverages a thin-provisioned capacity pooling to drive up to 80% capacity utilization. What this means is that you can provision a single Storage Pool which will only be consumed by the data you write. Second, it leverages data reduction technologies to further lower the capacity you need to purchase up front. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/hyperdisk-storage-pools-is-now-generally-available">blog post</a> that covers how they work and using them in your environment.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*g3EqC-sdF1JEdh-l.png" /></figure><p>Storage Pools are now available in Google Cloud console.</p><h3>DevOps and SRE</h3><p>The <a href="https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8uCHA4aRzcGDjg2?source=blog">2024 DORA Survey is open</a>. DORA has been a leading effort for over a decade to understand how organizations can continue to deliver key outcomes and what capabilities are essential to meet them. In this years survet, you will find key new themes that our industry has been discussing in detail: Artificial Intelligence, Platform Engineering and Developer Experience. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/2024-dora-survey-now-open">post</a> to know more about filling out the survey, access to other DORA material and more.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*9ZZA3snpkBRU7r3I.png" /></figure><h3>Databases</h3><p>When it comes to Cloud Migration, the words “migration” and “modernization” often come up. Do you just move your applications and data to the cloud, as is or should you look at modernizing your applications and databases by using some of the cloud providers services, thereby possibly looking at a new architecture too? This <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/modernization-vs-migration-for-data-workloads">post</a> takes a high level look at migration v/s modernization, the key factors to consider in the process along with best practices.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/0*HMAK5HwzR1bbziPj.jpg" /></figure><h3>Data Analytics</h3><p>BigQuery has support for analyzing your data using a range of LLMs hosted in Vertex AI (Gemini 1.0, text-bison, etc). But what if the models do not meet your expectations for some scenarios. What if model fine-tuning is needed for your specific case. Support for supervised fine-tuning and evaluation is now available in BigQuery. At a high level, “Supervised fine-tuning via BigQuery uses a dataset which has examples of input text (the prompt) and the expected ideal output text (the label), and fine-tunes the model to mimic the behavior or task implied from these examples.” Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/bigquery-can-now-fine-tune-models-hosted-in-vertex-ai">blog post</a> for more details via a walkthrough.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*i3FBpU5LCzxccNww.png" /></figure><p>In more BigQuery news, a new set of functions that enable model monitoring directly within BigQuery have been introduced. You can use these functions to describe data through profiling training or inference data, monitor skew between training and serving and monitor drift. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/monitor-ml-model-skew-and-drift-in-bigquery">blog post</a> for details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/606/0*0QIqaW6Y71fxQkB9.png" /></figure><p>It is no surprise that BigQuery is fast becoming a single place for integrating ML models, APIs and tools. Consider a scenario, where you need to analyze customer reviews that are available via voice recordings. This can all be done inside of BigQuery by utilizing the speech-to-text functionality and then using BigQuery ML to leverage Gemini 1.0 Pro to gain additional isnights and data formatting such as entity extraction and sentiment analysis. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/analyzing-customer-reviews-with-bigquery-mls-speech-to-text">blog post</a> that highlights how to do that.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*_HGknGud9up9_hw6.png" /></figure><h3>Developers and Practitioners</h3><p>Developer Productivity is a key topic of discussion across organizations today. With the proliferation of AI Assistants, organizations are trying to answer queries like “Do these tools help us code faster?”, “Did these tools help us save money?” and more. At the same time, it is important that we also look at it from the developers and their workflow. Take some time and read this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/ai-assistance-kickstarts-developer-productivity-whitepaper">paper</a> that explore what it means to measure developer productivity and how generative AI will make a difference.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/710/1*c1k_LbXnr0TVx0XwKCEigg.png" /></figure><h3>Learn Google Cloud</h3><p>If I may be allowed to say so, the best time to learn more about Google Cloud is today. There are new Generative AI courses announced on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZaNf2rA30k&amp;list=PLBgogxgQVM9sl-KnKywVEhkb3QtLHU4OK">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/?utm_source=cgc&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=certsailaunchapril2024">Google Cloud Skills Boost</a>. The courses range across beginner to advanced types.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/838/1*dep1TYGqu5alNMUavz1q3w.png" /></figure><p>Two new <a href="https://cloud.google.com/learn/certificates">Google Cloud certificates</a> have been announced too, Data Analytics and Cybersecurity.</p><p>A <a href="https://grow.google/certificates/interview-warmup/">new interview prep tool</a> has been launched too.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year, Google Cloud Monitoring had introduced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/uptime-checks/introduction">Synthetic Monitoring</a> and I covered in detail how you could write a Synthetic Monitoring Test Suite that could regularly perform tests on your deployed services.</p><p>The original blog post is here:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/google-cloud-synthetic-monitoring-tutorial-ce502f81bb24">Google Cloud Synthetic Monitoring Tutorial</a></p><p>A lot has happened in the last 8–10 months since the article and with the integration of Gemini in Google Cloud and especially within Synthetic Monitoring, it was time to revisit the article and see if I could ask Gemini to generate the Test Suite for me completely. The results have been fascinating and I would like to demonstrate that.</p><p>First up, for those of you, who are new to Synthetic Monitoring, I repeat sections of the original article over here:</p><h3>What is Synthetic Monitoring?</h3><p>As the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/uptime-checks/introduction">documentation</a> states and allow me to break it down:</p><ol><li>Test the availability, consistency, and performance of your services, applications, web pages, and APIs.</li><li>It works by periodically issue simulated requests and then records whether those requests were successful, and they record additional data about the request such as the latency.</li><li>You can be notified when a test fails by creating an <a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts">alerting policy</a> to monitor the test results.</li></ol><p>The original preview release of this feature required that we write the test cases in supported JavaScript Test Frameworks (Mocha) or with no frameworks too. These test cases would be wrapped inside of Google Cloud Functions (2nd generation powered by Cloud Run) and these functions would be invoked for you on a regular basis, depending on the recurring interval that you configure (every minute, 2 minutes, etc).</p><h3>Sample Inventory API (from the original article)</h3><p>To test out Synthetic Monitoring, we need something to test against. While we could have used some existing API endpoints and validated the results, its nice to see it all integrated within Google Cloud itself.</p><p>So the first thing that I am going to do is deploy a Sample Inventory API to my favourite service, Cloud Run.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/rominirani/cloud-code-sample-repository">GitHub - rominirani/cloud-code-sample-repository: Repository for Cloud Code sample applications</a></p><p>The repository has a Python Flask API that I am going to Cloud Run. You can follow the instructions in the README, where it gives you the choice to use either VS Code with Cloud Code extension or if you prefer, directly via a gcloud command.</p><p>To keep things simple, just go to the python-flask-api folder and execute the following gcloud command to deploy the service to Google Cloud Run:</p><pre>gcloud run deploy --source .</pre><p>This will ask you multiple questions. Go ahead with them and within a couple of minutes, you should have the Inventory API deployed in Googele Cloud Run and you have a URL via which you can access the same. The Service URL will be of the format:</p><p>https://&lt;SERVICE_NAME&gt;.xxxxx.a.run.app</p><p>Let us refer to the above url as SERVICE_URL for the rest of the article.</p><h3>Test out the Inventory API</h3><p>Before we start writing the Tests and deploying the Synthetic Monitors, lets understand the basic API.</p><p>The Inventory API has 3 methods and it has pre-populated data of 3 Inventory Items (I-1, I-2 and I-3) along with their associated on-hand quantity. We can try out:</p><ul><li>SERVICE_URL/inventory : This will give a list of all inventory items.<br>[ { “I-1”: 10, “I-2”: 20, “I-3”: 30 }]</li><li>SERVICE_URL/inventory/I-1: This will give a specific Inventory record with its quantity.<br>{ “productid”: “I-1”, “qty”: 10}</li><li>SERVICE_URL/inventory/I-100: Since this record is not present, it is an incorrect product id and hence the qty returned is -1.<br>{ “productid”: I-200, “qty”: -1}</li></ul><h3>Asking Gemini to help us write the Tests</h3><p>Login to Google Cloud Console and visit the Cloud Monitoring → Synthetic Monitoring page as shown below:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/492/1*r7Tc6bZWF3dl6baYBFP97g.png" /></figure><p>This will bring up the Synthetic monitoring page as shown below:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4RfEgOjyrqLD8wsOKUmHXA.png" /></figure><p>Click on the <strong>CREATE SYNTHETIC MONITOR </strong>button. This will bring up a form as shown below. I have given a name <strong>s1</strong> to my monitor and then I click on the <strong>HELP ME CODE </strong>button as shown below.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UNu_66tLnWpenC2cwH2T0g.png" /></figure><p>This brings up a nice popup, where you are asked to describe the test scripts that you want in natural language (prompt). It also provides you a helpful Example text that you can modify/enhance and use.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*122AqUCTlq0VAcvNB5n9XA.png" /></figure><p>I provide the following prompt:</p><pre>Help me write a Node.js based synthetic test script that performs the following tests:<br>1. It does a GET operation on https://python-flask-api-ido3ocn3pq-uc.a.run.app/inventory. This should return a 200 HTTP status code.<br>2. It does a GET operations on https://python-flask-api-ido3ocn3pq-uc.a.run.app/inventory/I-1. This should return a 200 HTTP status code. It should contain a JSON reponse as an object and the object should have an attribute &quot;productid&quot;, whose value should be &quot;I-1&quot;.<br>3. It does a GET operations on https://python-flask-api-ido3ocn3pq-uc.a.run.app/inventory/I-123. This should return a 200 HTTP status code. It should contain a JSON reponse as an object and the object should have an attribute &quot;qty&quot;, whose value should be -1.</pre><p>I provide the above prompt and click on <strong>GENERATE.</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Df2LXB1_S-XxlZGP0ZWyEA.png" /></figure><p>This provides me a good snippet of test code as shown below:</p><pre>const assert = require(&#39;assert&#39;);<br>const fetch = require(&#39;node-fetch&#39;);<br><br>async function run(logger, executionId) {<br>  try {<br>    logger.log(&#39;Starting test&#39;);<br><br>    // Test 1: GET https://python-flask-api-ido3ocn3pq-uc.a.run.app/inventory<br>    const response1 = await fetch(&#39;https://python-flask-api-ido3ocn3pq-uc.a.run.app/inventory&#39;);<br>    assert.strictEqual(response1.status, 200);<br><br>    // Test 2: GET https://python-flask-api-ido3ocn3pq-uc.a.run.app/inventory/I-1<br>    const response2 = await fetch(&#39;https://python-flask-api-ido3ocn3pq-uc.a.run.app/inventory/I-1&#39;);<br>    assert.strictEqual(response2.status, 200);<br>    const data2 = await response2.json();<br>    assert.strictEqual(data2.productid, &#39;I-1&#39;);<br><br>    // Test 3: GET https://python-flask-api-ido3ocn3pq-uc.a.run.app/inventory/I-123<br>    const response3 = await fetch(&#39;https://python-flask-api-ido3ocn3pq-uc.a.run.app/inventory/I-123&#39;);<br>    assert.strictEqual(response3.status, 200);<br>    const data3 = await response3.json();<br>    assert.strictEqual(data3.qty, -1);<br><br>    logger.log(&#39;Test passed&#39;);<br>  } catch (err) {<br>    logger.error(err);<br>    throw err;<br>  }<br>}<br><br>exports.run = run;</pre><p>As you can see, its nicely generated the 3 test cases and I am happy with the code generated and can put it to test. What is very interesting is the attention given to reducing the friction further by allowing you to insert and package this code immediately into a Cloud Function. That is very helpful indeed.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kcfpge5z__yI0-1SpGUOrw.png" /></figure><p>Go ahead and click on the <strong>INSERT INTO CLOUD FUNCTION </strong>button. This brings up the Create Google Cloud Function dialog and the required fields and data is automatically populated for you. Notice the Cloud Function name, its trigger and the necessary code files (JS and package.json) that is generated for you:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hi8M62avPuryuPYj0I8M6A.png" /></figure><p>Simply click on <strong>APPLY FUNCTION </strong>button. This will bring you back to the Create Synthetic check page, where you can further setup the Alert Name, Notification Channels and so on, should the check fail and you need to get notified. Click on <strong>CREATE</strong> button there to move forward.</p><p>This kicks off the process to deploy the Synthetic monitor and you are presented with the status as shown below:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uRTwaUV_WiqRpXxW6RGONA.png" /></figure><p>Give it a few minutes, since this deploys the Google Cloud Function (2nd Generation) and once its applied, then the Monitoring tests will be executed automatically for you based on the interval that you specified.</p><p>I observed that the tests ran fine for me and here are a few executions of the same.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y6C0GiOHn9RjrUVjcK5fDw.png" /></figure><p>The details for each of the runs can be seen on clicking the Monitor, the details of which are shown below:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*O60lUiI8MtzmyMk9UgKzTg.png" /></figure><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>It is interesting to note that a few months back, I had to wrangle with Mocha Test code to get the test suite working well but now Gemini, as the Assistant gave me code that was able to run. It gives me a good basis on which I can further enhance the suite. Definitely, a great way on how to introduce Generative AI suggestions (in this case, Code Generation) into existing applications.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=359561a23230" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/using-gemini-to-help-write-synthetic-monitoring-tests-in-google-cloud-359561a23230">Using Gemini to help write Synthetic Monitoring tests in Google Cloud</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud">Google Cloud - Community</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/tags-support-in-backup-and-dr-service-simplifies-vm-protection">post</a>.</li><li>You can now look at meeting data retention compliance via the new Object retention lock. This feature helps you set and lock retention configurations on Cloud Storage objects, with a “retain until time.” This means that an object with an object retention lock can not be deleted or replaced until the retain until time has passed. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/introducing-cloud-storage-object-retention-lock">post</a>.</li></ul><p>At Cloud NEXT 24, with GenAI clearly dominating the mindspace, optimized storage solutions and features were announced to address the challenge of decreasing model load, training, and inference times while maximizing accelerator utilization. These included Cloud Storage FUSE with file caching, ParallelStore, Hyperdisk ML and more.

Think of one or more applications that you have deployed on Google Cloud. It is a challenge to understand visualizing that application in terms of not just the cloud resources that it uses but dependencies on other services, across project services and more. App Hub is targetted to address that by introducing abstractions in the form of Applications, Workloads and Services. It is able to injest automatically key Google Cloud services that Applications would use and then build out a dependency graph that is kept updated all the time. The current resources that it supports are various Load Balancing services (Services) and Compute Engine MIGs (Workloads). As the service grows to support GKE and Cloud Run, it could get very useful. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/introducing-app-hub">blog post</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/837/0*5XM3_D4twH2WlPqq.png" /></figure><p>If you are using Apigee, Gemini Code Assist is making its way into the product suite to help ease the task of developing API specifications, API integrations and more. For example, when it comes to building out APIs, you can build out an API Specification using the Gemini Code Assist integration inside of the Cloud Code VS Code extension.

Right, isn’t it? An interesting <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/breakout-sessions-for-it-pros-at-next24">post</a> highlights top 5 questions IT pros have been asking ranging from reducing costs, evaluating reliability of cloud providers, AI infrastructure, scalability and control requirements and more. The post further highlights the sessions where these questions are likely to get answered. Build out that agenda, I tell you.</p><h3>Infrastructure</h3><p>Forrester Research has recognized Google as a Leader in The Forrester Wave™: AI Infrastructure Solutions, Q1 2024. Google received the highest scores of any vendor evaluated in both Current Offering and Strategy categories in the report. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure-modernization/google-named-a-leader-in-the-forrester-wave-ai-infrastructure-solutions-q1-2024">post</a> and download the <a href="https://inthecloud.withgoogle.com/forrester-2024-ai-infra-wave/dl-cd.html?_ga=2.73419927.-428458833.1709094666&amp;_gac=1.195768030.1710843694.CjwKCAjwzN-vBhAkEiwAYiO7oHLj_RGrKSAo4oJDQU2SjU77HFVCySA9Xf8sfel4d3tEe32CenfQghoCEcAQAvD_BwE&amp;_gl=1*1t5omrr*_ga*NDI4NDU4ODMzLjE3MDkwOTQ2NjY.*_ga_WH2QY8WWF5*MTcxMTg3Njc5MS4yLjEuMTcxMTg3OTIwMi4wLjAuMA..">report</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dtl-shtgVZJt9TX7IzHaYw.png" /></figure><p>NVIDIA NeMo is an open-source, end-to-end platform purpose-built for developing custom, enterprise-grade generative AI models. Looking to train models on Google Kubernetes Engine (FGKE) using NVIDIA accelerated computing and NVIDIA NeMo framework? Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/gke-and-nvidia-nemo-framework-to-train-generative-ai-models">blog post</a> also discusses a reference architecture that highlights the major components, tools and common services used to train the NeMo large language model using GKE.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*zk2fdOnHrZN2_Qj1.png" /></figure><p>Google Cloud VMware Engine is now integrated with Google Cloud NetApp Volumes. This availability enables customers to resize volumes without interruption. Separating out the scaling of compute and storage gives lots of flexiblity and cost control too. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure-modernization/google-cloud-netapp-volumes-integrates-with-vmware-engine">post</a> for more details.</p><p>Persistent Disk Asynchronous Replication (PD Async Replication) provides low recovery point objective (RPO) and low recovery time objective (RTO) block storage replication for cross-region active-passive disaster recovery (DR). It is a storage option that provides asynchronous replication of data between two regions. It can be used to manage replication for Compute Engine workloads at the infrastructure-level, instead of the workload-level. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/using-pd-async-replication-for-windows-server-disaster-recovery">blog post</a> with an example of how it works.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*iSe8yCNZwpzG6SXr.png" /></figure><h3>Customers</h3><p>VPC service Controls (VPC-SC) is a foundational security control that creates an isolation perimeter around managed cloud resources and networks. Via granular ingress and egress rules, you can selectively approve access across perimeter boundaries and play a key role in preventing data exfiltration. Consider CommerzBank, a leading German bank, that is a trusted partner to approx. 26000 corporate client groups and 11 million private and small business customers. With the shift from IP addresses to API endpoints, a new approach was needed to address data sharing and movement needs. Especially around data sharing, CommerzBank had some clear criteria to evaluate any solution and VPC-SC met all these requirements. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/customers/how-commerzbank-safeguards-its-data-with-vpc-service-controls">post</a> to learn more.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*PsWNx1LNe_XuC3GQ.png" /></figure><p>In another interesting customer case study, consider that of Palo Alto Networks. Their solid growth coupled with mergers and acquisitions had lead to more than 170,000 projects on Google Cloud. They did a large exercise a few years back around labelling that helped that identify the team, owner, cost center and environment for these projects (95% coverage). But the final 5% proved to be a challenge till they achieved that with BigQuery ML, which is the built-in machine learning feature in BigQuery. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-palo-alto-networks-uses-bigquery-ml">post</a>.</p><h3>Containers and Kubernetes</h3><p>Managing the growth of your GKE clusters required that you had insights into each specific limits like Nodes per cluster, Noder per node pool, pods per cluster and more. Your task just got easier with the introduction of directly monitoring and setting alerts for crucial scalability limits. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gke-gets-new-quota-monitoring-feature">post</a> for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*8X7HfXAqrPH2RIRz.png" /></figure><p>Ray, an open-source Python framework designed for scaling and distributing AI workloads is gaining widespread acceptance. While you can run Ray deployments on VMs, the traditional challenges that come with running workloads on your own on VMs i.e. resource efficiency and managing infrastructure come up. A suggested alternative is to deploy Ray on GKE with KubeRay, an open-source Kubernetes operator that simplifies Ray deployment and management. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/the-benefits-of-using-gke-for-running-ray-ai-workloads">post</a> that dives into the details on why running Ray on GKE would be the best way for you to go forward.</p><p>Continuing with Ray, are you running Ray on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)? Here is an essential blog post to read to run Ray securely on GKE. The post delves into areas that you need to address to harden your Ray installation on GKE and a solid summarization of best practices vis-a-vis Kubernetes and GKE constructs like namespaces, RBAC, NetworkPolicy and more. Safer defaults for running Ray with Kubernetes using KubeRay is a focus area and <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-on-gke/blob/main/ray-on-gke/README.md">Terraform templates</a> are available to spin up a multi-team environment with sample security configurations.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*WY1oRpGnazhikqte.jpg" /></figure><p>The final piece on Ray is that of Kueue, a cloud-native queueing system that provides advanced scheduling for Ray applications on GKE. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/using-kuberay-and-kueue-to-orchestrate-ray-applications-in-gke">blog post</a> that shows how KubeRay and Kueue work together to achieve the same.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*q1spCntYfLdXRIC5.png" /></figure><p>Speak of training AI models and the need for NVIDIA GPUs comes up regularly. GKE is probably one of the best choices available to deploy, scale and manage custom ML platforms. In an added boost, GKE can now automatically install NVIDIA GPU drivers. This process was manually done before and the automatic installation now even allows for the drivers to be precompiled for the GKE node, which can reduce the time it takes for GPU nodes to startup. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gke-can-now-automatically-install-nvidia-gpu-drivers">post</a> for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-IfpWIT5x9drgypU.png" /></figure><p>Stanford’s Brain Inferencing Laboratory explore motor systems neuroscience and neuroengineering applications. The relevant data for their research is obtained from experiments on preclininal models and human clinical studies. This data is handled via a complex platform that they have setup for standardized analyses and adhoc analyses. The components of the architecture include Containers, Git, CI/CD and compute clusters, specifically GKE running in Autopilot mode. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/stanford-team-uses-devops-tools-to-manage-research-data">blog post</a> for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/512/0*-ez2Hh1aqKPxtFWz.png" /></figure><h3>Identity and Security</h3><p>This edition is heavy with security updates and let’s begin with zero-day vulnerabilities but what does that mean? A zero-day vulnerability is a security flaw in an application or operating system that has not been discovered, and there is no defense or patch for it. Did you know Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Mandiant showed 97 zero-day vulnerabilities were exploited in 2023. Is that an improvement over 2022 or 2021. Find about this and more in this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/2023-zero-day-trends">post</a>.</p><p>You must have heard about Assured Workloads, which allows companies to run regulated workloads in several Google Cloud’s global regions. Consider the requirement then for your organization to adhere to compliance requirements in more than one geographic region, how do you then use Assured Workloads to create regulatory boundaries using a folder structure? Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-to-set-compliance-controls-for-your-google-cloud-organization">post</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YXPQRu5G853XXc3MRAue6Q.png" /></figure><p>In Google Cloud, we have the Organization resource right at the top in hierarchy. With the creation of this resource, you get access to Organization Policy Service. As part of a new release, a set of organization policies have been released that enforce the need to fix potentially insecure postures. These policies scan across IAM, Storage and Essential Contacts. For e.g. a few of the policies at the IAM level include disabling service account key creation, disabling service account key upload and more. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-stronger-default-org-policies-for-our-customers">post</a> to learn more of these policies that are available to all customers who are creating organization resources and for existing customers, who already have done that, these policies are available with no change required.</p><p>Cloud Armor plays an important role in enabling organizations to create a comprehensive DDOS mitigation strategy for their applications. One of the capabilities that plays a key role is that of rate-limiting via which you can curtail traffic to backend resources based on request volume. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-to-improve-resilience-to-ddos-attacks-with-cloud-armor-advanced-rate-limiting-capabilities">post</a> that highlights the rate-limiting features of Cloud Armor, the two types of actions available for rate-based rules (Throttle, Rate-based ban), planning your rate limiting deployment and more.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gUDRcmgcFoTaX_s0.png" /></figure><p>Handling sensitive data vis-a-vis security, privacy and compliance is an essential requirement for any application handling customer data. Discovery Service, that is part of Google Cloud’s Sensitive Data Protection helps to identify where Sensitive Data resides, which is the first step. Cloud SQL is now supported by the Discovery Service. Earlier it supported BigQuery and BigLake. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/expanding-sensitive-data-protection-to-make-it-easier-to-protect-data-in-cloud-sql">post</a> for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ujrb4T08v6Ekjnth.png" /></figure><p>Software Supply Chain attacks are common and organizations need to bring in strict controls, especially when they modern applications have heavy dependency on open source software. Check out this joint <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-to-choose-a-known-trusted-supplier-for-open-source-software">blog post</a> from Citi and Google, on common open source attack vectors and 3 main criteria to evaluate an OSS vendor.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*s38cJUiBW3x3vtTq.png" /></figure><p>Security will continue to be a big topic at Cloud Next ’24. The 2nd CISO bulletin for March 2024 drops a hint on key security topics and discussion to expect at the conference. In an earlier edition, we had covered the intersection of Gen AI and Security and the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-get-ready-for-next-24-what-you-need-to-know">post</a> seems to point towards that and of course, multiple other security areas that will receive attention during the event. The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-easing-the-psychological-burden-of-leadership">first CISO bulletin for March</a> this month, focused on psychological resilience in cybersecurity leadership.</p><p>To end the security updates, a slightly different area this time but nevertheless an important one.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Google Cloud Platform Technology Nuggets — March 1–15, 2024 Edition</h3><p>Welcome to the March 1–15, 2024 edition of Google Cloud Technology Nuggets.</p><p>Please feel free to give <a href="https://forms.gle/UAsAS7YLxYSBTNBy9">feedback</a> on this issue and share the <a href="https://gcptechnuggets.substack.com/">subscription form</a> with your peers.</p><h3>Google Cloud NEXT ’24 Updates</h3><p>Google Cloud NEXT ’24 is just a few weeks away. If you are attending the event in-person, the <a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/session-library?utm_source=cgc-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=FY24-Q2-global-ENDM33-physicalevent-er-next-2024-mc&amp;utm_content=cgc-blog-session-launch-feb&amp;utm_term=-">full list of sessions</a> is now available. You can also make use of the Agenda Builder to plan out attending the sessions that you don’t want to miss. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/full-session-catalog-now-live-for-google-cloud-next24">blog post</a> for more details and check out some of the anticipated sessions mention in the post.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*vsTKI3JJFN9vmIR8.jpg" /></figure><h3>Containers and Kubernetes</h3><p>There are several updates in this space for this edition of the newsletter.</p><p>Solution Architectures are all about tradeoffs isn’t it? Regional or a Zonal cluster for your GKE environments? You have to consider multiple points like availability, costs, maintenance, scalability and more. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/choosing-a-regional-vs-zonal-gke-cluster">detailed article</a> that breaks down each of these points vis-a-vis Regional and Zonal clusters.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PCTIhE45lk5Gpe84ydZiuA.png" /></figure><p>Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in Autopilot mode is seeing significant updates of late to make it ideally suited to running your AI workloads, not just from the manageability perspective but from the choice of compute options. There are two new compute classes in Autopilot that have been introduced: Accelerator and Performance. The Accelerator class improves GPU support with resource reservation capabilities. The Performance class enables high-performance workloads to run on Autopilot mode at scale. There are several pricing updates too, including a price cut for majority of GPU workloads running on GKE in Autopilot mode, along with the ability to keep your existing Reservations and committed use discounts, as you move your workloads between the Standard and Autopilot modes of GKE, as well as between Compute Engine VMs. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/new-features-to-run-ai-more-efficiently-on-fully-managed-gke">post</a> for more details.</p><p>Have you heard about ECK? It is Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes and the official Elastic Operator for Kubernetes. If you are looking to run the Elastic Stack on a cloud-native Kubernetes environment, then this is the way to go. Combine that with running it on GKE in Autopilot mode, and the combination gets the best of both services. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gke-autopilot-supports-elastic-cloud-on-kubernetes">blog post</a> for more details.</p><p>Looking to create an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) for your teams, as part of Platform Engineering, you need to consider a foundation that can provide flexibility in terms of the requirements that your developers would have. Kubernetes is a solid foundation to do that due to the abstractions that it has available. But building one is a significant task and there is good help here in terms of the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gke-build-an-enterprise-developer-platform-for-fast-app-delivery">blog post</a> and a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/enterprise-application-blueprint">detailed solution guide</a>. Check it out.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gkFV7tQu5_qr2DcI.png" /></figure><p>One more post that highlights the GKE Autopilot value proposition and this time it is about how it handles security for you. In summary, it helps you configure nodes, node pools, and in-cluster policy for you according to security best practices, allowing you to focus on workload-specific security. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/move-in-ready-kubernetes-security-with-gke-autopilot">informative article</a> to brush up on Kubernetes security aspects and what Autopilot mode does for you, as part of the shared fate operating model.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/991/0*NrHMWPCs6N1SpxGD.png" /></figure><h3>Customers</h3><p>You are going through an application modernization journey at your organization and the initial applications that you have containerized and moved to Cloud Run have been a success. On top of that, you have achieved some of these numbers: 70% toil reduction, 90% cost savings, and unlocked new capabilities by integrating with some of the services available on Google Cloud? This is exactly what DZ Bank, the second largest bank in Germany in terms of assets, has published. Check out their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/how-dz-bank-uses-a-cloud-run-first-approach-to-unlock-big-savings">story</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*OAIjCEqjo-cyfYrB.png" /></figure><p>Another customer success is from Glance, which provides innovative lock screen experiences across millions of mobile phones. Glance recently migrated their database from Azure Cosmos DB to Cloud Spanner. The move was needed due to the frequent need to optimize their application vis-a-vis the database requirements and operations management too. To select a database, they conducted a month-long proof of concept with various databases to ensure that their pipelines worked along with their performance requirements. Spanner emerged as the Database of choice. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/why-glance-migrated-its-document-database-to-spanner">post</a> that discusses their experience, reasons for moving, what Spanner provides them and more.</p><h3>Identity and Security</h3><p>Security Command Center Enterprise edition has been announced. It fuses cloud and enterprise security requirements into a single offering that you can use across your multi-cloud environments. The edition is integrated with various aspects of Mandiant solutions too. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-security-command-center-enterprise">blog</a> for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/633/0*I9Y9h6q2o4Tyy3GT.png" /></figure><p>The first of Google Cloud Security Talks of 2024 have started.

Speaking of Anthropic’s Claude 3 models, they are soon going to be available on Vertex AI Model Garden, with one of the models (Sonnet), which is best combination of skills and speed is now available in private preview for customers. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-anthropics-claude-3-models-in-google-cloud-vertex-ai">blog post</a> on this announcement.</p><p>It is generally accepted now that while foundational models are more than capable, the way forward is to have a specialized model for your domain. But which approach should you use to specialize it. Should you use Prompt Engineering, RAG or Fine tuning? Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/three-step-design-pattern-for-specializing-llms">post</a> that gives you an overview of these approaches and a side-by-side comparison.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*J4deyAgU8O-5w6ip.png" /></figure><h3>Databases</h3><p>As Organizations continue to grapple with how to maximize capabilities with Gen AI, the fundamental point remains that you will need to have ability to access, manage, and activate all types of data. What this means for Cloud Providers is to assess this development and see how their own services around Database products stands and adding native Gen AI capabilities within the products itself. In a key blog post that highlights how Google Cloud has expanded the GenAI capabilities across key products like BigQuery, AlloyDB, Spanner and more is noteworthy. With this capabilities, your usage of cross services goes up but then the data and governance can be better managed. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/bigquery-and-alloydb-hit-major-milestone-with-ai-enabled-updates">blog post</a> in details that highlights some of these developments.</p><p>In a similar key <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/discover-new-gen-ai-google-cloud-database-capabilities">post</a>, read about announcements around general availability (GA) of AlloyDB AI, an integrated set of capabilities in AlloyDB to easily build Enterprise Gen AI apps and introduction of vector search capabilities across Spanner, MySQL, and Redis. There is also an increasing integration with LangChain across these features.</p><p>Speaking of LangChain integrations, the key question is what are the LangChain packages that leverage these new Google Cloud database features. The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/build-rag-applications-with-langchain-and-google-cloud">blog post</a> highlights the packages around Document Loaders, Vector Stores and Chat Messages Memory.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A selection of Duet AI in Google Cloud materials that are worth your attention.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/316/0*w5mOtHVpRnSxVAuK.png" /></figure><p><strong>Developer and Operational Productivity in Google Cloud with Duet AI</strong></p><p>This is an excellent session that can be one that you can use both for your own understanding and also across the organization. It manages to cover a whole range of topics from developer productivity, what problem Duet AI addresses, key areas that Duet AI can help out developers and demonstrations of the same. I liked the take on how Developer Productivity, which if boosted through tools like Duet AI, can directly influence positive business outcomes.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FjpmmC6GATRc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DjpmmC6GATRc&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FjpmmC6GATRc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/dabc080d9919caeef91a71ef036024f2/href">https://medium.com/media/dabc080d9919caeef91a71ef036024f2/href</a></iframe><p><strong>Code Vipassana Season 5 Session 3: Duet AI to accelerate test driven development</strong></p><p>Test Driven Development is a key methodology when working with an existing code base and then introducing new functionality. Duet AI is well suited to this since it supports you with Code explanaibility, code generation, test case generation and documentation. If you get this technique right and Duet AI works well, you are bound to see a good productivity improvement and still ensuring a code % of code coverage. This session uses the Ruby language, so a good way for you to even check out how well Duet AI supports the language.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FOIv68OWuEXk&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DOIv68OWuEXk&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FOIv68OWuEXk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/1242d4c64c964685bb3a78f443212061/href">https://medium.com/media/1242d4c64c964685bb3a78f443212061/href</a></iframe><p><strong>Duet AI for building a Chrome Extension app in JavaScript</strong></p><p>This is an interesting session from Code Vipassana Season 5 again. This time, you build out a Chrome Extension with Duet AI’s assistance. The essence of such a session is to show that you could pretty use Duet AI for a wide variety of tasks. Often folks ask this question on how well Duet AI will work for a specific language, framework or task? The usual answer that I give is … try it.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fp8_m6bG3iwQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dp8_m6bG3iwQ&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fp8_m6bG3iwQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/23163a0dd7a395db11470ef20d704cf0/href">https://medium.com/media/23163a0dd7a395db11470ef20d704cf0/href</a></iframe><p>👉 For all Duet AI resources, check out the Github Repo: <a href="https://lnkd.in/deY9zWn9">https://lnkd.in/deY9zWn9</a></p><p>👉 If you’d like to share an article you wrote or came across on Duet AI, please submit to the repo and/or share in the comments.</p><p>👉 If you’d consider sharing a blog on <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud">Google Cloud Community publication</a>, do reach out.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=298196dbd3c8" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/duet-ai-in-google-cloud-material-worth-looking-at-this-week-march-4-2024-298196dbd3c8">Duet AI in Google Cloud material worth looking at this week: March 4, 2024</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud">Google Cloud - Community</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has never been a better time to be a software developer. You’ve heard that enough … right? I truly believe so. With the advent of AI Code Assistants / AI Pair Programmer or other similar terms to describe the same thing, where does that leave software developers?</p><p>There is a camp that says that AI will take away software developer jobs? We’ve also been hearing that our younger generation should no longer learn programming? There are folks on the other side, who say that these AI code assistants are going to help the software developer get better? I believe that each of these views have some truth to it but the context and details matter. In this article, I am here to highlight the view <strong>“AI Code Assistants are going to help the software developer get better”</strong></p><p>Let’s cut through the noise first and dig a little deeper into what do we mean when we say that AI assistants are going to help the software developers get <strong>better</strong> or more <strong>efficient</strong> in doing their <strong>jobs</strong>. I have intentionally highlighted the words : better, efficient and jobs.</p><p>The word “better” and “efficient” is something that I will interpret as a given because any help that the assistants give to do our jobs, will be a positive outcome. And with every strong trend, like the one we are seeing now with AI Code Assistants, we are likely to see increasing investments and once the hype is settled and as adoption grows, we all benefit from these tools getting better and better at what they do.</p><p>So, lets move on to the 3rd word in there : jobs. It begs the question, What is the job of a software developer? We are likely to get tons of views again over there and my goal in this article is to highlight a couple of surveys that flip the question around “what are the jobs or tasks that software developers would like the AI Code Assistants to do?”. That should give us a good glimpse into not just the kind of activities that a developer does, but areas where they are hinting they need help to get more of it done in less time, more efficiently, faster, etc.</p><p>First up, is the RedMonk study titled “10 Things Developers Want from AI Code Assistants” (November 2023)</p><p><a href="https://redmonk.com/kholterhoff/2023/11/01/10-things-developers-want-from-ai-code-assistants/">10 Things Developers Want from AI Code Assistants</a></p><p>I have taken the liberty here to summarize this into a table given below:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ol51ceGXYaYh9rXM6tSCvw.png" /></figure><p>Check out another survey, this time from <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#developer-tools-ai-tool">Stack Overflow (2023 Developer Survey)</a>. The chart below looks at what developers are using it for.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FZUE6u4LJlm--DHDELxJ9w.png" /></figure><p>The next chart presents an interesting view (what they plan or would be interested in using it for):</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y7NoPFHnvjwttDQxckmeCQ.png" /></figure><p>It would be fair to say that 3 areas that commonly come up from this are:</p><ol><li>Code Generation</li><li>Testing</li><li>Understanding Code, Documenting it, Getting information</li></ol><p>One can argue what is new in all of this? You did not need this trend to identify tasks that the software developers were supposed to be doing in any case.</p><p>This brings me to the point that I wish to highlight in this article and its clearly addressed to Managers, who are leading software development teams. The surveys above clearly shows that today, teams are using AI code assistants in multiple areas and/or are planning to use it. Getting help to get better at their roles, getting more work done efficiently, while still focusing on quality can have a transformative impact on the team.</p><h4>Call to Action</h4><p>You should look at investing your time into understanding and using these tools today in your team. Chances are that some of your developers are already familiar with them, have given them a try and have interesting data to share. The recommended approach would be to look at building out a Proof of Concept application utilising these tools, understand areas (both the most requested ones and even others from the list above) where the tools are making a positive difference. Do keep in mind that these tools are not perfect and have limitations, so look at their outputs carefully.</p><p>Happy Developers lead to positive business outcomes and the AI Code Assistants can play a big role in making the development process better and more efficient.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a0f88f58abf3" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>
