            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Google Cloud Platform Technology Nuggets — March 16–31, 2024 Edition</h3><p>Welcome to the March 16–31, 2024 edition of Google Cloud Platform Technology Nuggets.</p><p>Please feel free to give <a href="https://forms.gle/UAsAS7YLxYSBTNBy9">feedback</a> on this issue and share the <a href="https://gcptechnuggets.substack.com/">subscription form</a> with your peers.</p><h3>Google Cloud Next 2024</h3><p>We are less than 10 days away from the biggest Google Cloud Event of the year and the excitement is building up. This year, the event is expected to have a large number of technical sessions, based on the feedback received last year.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*QCWF8kgUU95aY0HA.jpg" /></figure><p>Several blog posts have started to highlight key sessions to attend from the respective areas: Networking, Dev Practitioners and more. Even if you are not there at the conference, these posts are good reference points to start building out sessions that you would like to watch once they are posted online.</p><p>Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Dev Connect at Next ’24</strong>: This is one of the key themes of the conference and the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/dev-connect-at-next24">post</a> highlights some specific sessions, areas to hang out with fellow practitioners and this is not just for Google Cloud but how all other services Firebase, Android and more come together.</li><li><strong>Networking Sessions</strong>: 12 must attend networking and network security sessions at Next ’24. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/networking-session-preview-at-next24">post</a>.</li></ul><p>If you are into managing IT, then there is a constant pressure to streamline your infrastructure, manage it seamlessly and keep costs at a minimum. Right, isn’t it? An interesting <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/breakout-sessions-for-it-pros-at-next24">post</a> highlights top 5 questions IT pros have been asking ranging from reducing costs, evaluating reliability of cloud providers, AI infrastructure, scalability and control requirements and more. The post further highlights the sessions where these questions are likely to get answered. Build out that agenda, I tell you.</p><h3>Infrastructure</h3><p>Forrester Research has recognized Google as a Leader in The Forrester Wave™: AI Infrastructure Solutions, Q1 2024. Google received the highest scores of any vendor evaluated in both Current Offering and Strategy categories in the report. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure-modernization/google-named-a-leader-in-the-forrester-wave-ai-infrastructure-solutions-q1-2024">post</a> and download the <a href="https://inthecloud.withgoogle.com/forrester-2024-ai-infra-wave/dl-cd.html?_ga=2.73419927.-428458833.1709094666&amp;_gac=1.195768030.1710843694.CjwKCAjwzN-vBhAkEiwAYiO7oHLj_RGrKSAo4oJDQU2SjU77HFVCySA9Xf8sfel4d3tEe32CenfQghoCEcAQAvD_BwE&amp;_gl=1*1t5omrr*_ga*NDI4NDU4ODMzLjE3MDkwOTQ2NjY.*_ga_WH2QY8WWF5*MTcxMTg3Njc5MS4yLjEuMTcxMTg3OTIwMi4wLjAuMA..">report</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dtl-shtgVZJt9TX7IzHaYw.png" /></figure><p>NVIDIA NeMo is an open-source, end-to-end platform purpose-built for developing custom, enterprise-grade generative AI models. Looking to train models on Google Kubernetes Engine (FGKE) using NVIDIA accelerated computing and NVIDIA NeMo framework? Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/gke-and-nvidia-nemo-framework-to-train-generative-ai-models">blog post</a> also discusses a reference architecture that highlights the major components, tools and common services used to train the NeMo large language model using GKE.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*zk2fdOnHrZN2_Qj1.png" /></figure><p>Google Cloud VMware Engine is now integrated with Google Cloud NetApp Volumes. This availability enables customers to resize volumes without interruption. Separating out the scaling of compute and storage gives lots of flexiblity and cost control too. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure-modernization/google-cloud-netapp-volumes-integrates-with-vmware-engine">post</a> for more details.</p><p>Persistent Disk Asynchronous Replication (PD Async Replication) provides low recovery point objective (RPO) and low recovery time objective (RTO) block storage replication for cross-region active-passive disaster recovery (DR). It is a storage option that provides asynchronous replication of data between two regions. It can be used to manage replication for Compute Engine workloads at the infrastructure-level, instead of the workload-level. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/using-pd-async-replication-for-windows-server-disaster-recovery">blog post</a> with an example of how it works.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*iSe8yCNZwpzG6SXr.png" /></figure><h3>Customers</h3><p>VPC service Controls (VPC-SC) is a foundational security control that creates an isolation perimeter around managed cloud resources and networks. Via granular ingress and egress rules, you can selectively approve access across perimeter boundaries and play a key role in preventing data exfiltration. Consider CommerzBank, a leading German bank, that is a trusted partner to approx. 26000 corporate client groups and 11 million private and small business customers. With the shift from IP addresses to API endpoints, a new approach was needed to address data sharing and movement needs. Especially around data sharing, CommerzBank had some clear criteria to evaluate any solution and VPC-SC met all these requirements. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/customers/how-commerzbank-safeguards-its-data-with-vpc-service-controls">post</a> to learn more.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*PsWNx1LNe_XuC3GQ.png" /></figure><p>In another interesting customer case study, consider that of Palo Alto Networks. Their solid growth coupled with mergers and acquisitions had lead to more than 170,000 projects on Google Cloud. They did a large exercise a few years back around labelling that helped that identify the team, owner, cost center and environment for these projects (95% coverage). But the final 5% proved to be a challenge till they achieved that with BigQuery ML, which is the built-in machine learning feature in BigQuery. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-palo-alto-networks-uses-bigquery-ml">post</a>.</p><h3>Containers and Kubernetes</h3><p>Managing the growth of your GKE clusters required that you had insights into each specific limits like Nodes per cluster, Noder per node pool, pods per cluster and more. Your task just got easier with the introduction of directly monitoring and setting alerts for crucial scalability limits. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gke-gets-new-quota-monitoring-feature">post</a> for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*8X7HfXAqrPH2RIRz.png" /></figure><p>Ray, an open-source Python framework designed for scaling and distributing AI workloads is gaining widespread acceptance. While you can run Ray deployments on VMs, the traditional challenges that come with running workloads on your own on VMs i.e. resource efficiency and managing infrastructure come up. A suggested alternative is to deploy Ray on GKE with KubeRay, an open-source Kubernetes operator that simplifies Ray deployment and management. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/the-benefits-of-using-gke-for-running-ray-ai-workloads">post</a> that dives into the details on why running Ray on GKE would be the best way for you to go forward.</p><p>Continuing with Ray, are you running Ray on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)? Here is an essential blog post to read to run Ray securely on GKE. The post delves into areas that you need to address to harden your Ray installation on GKE and a solid summarization of best practices vis-a-vis Kubernetes and GKE constructs like namespaces, RBAC, NetworkPolicy and more. Safer defaults for running Ray with Kubernetes using KubeRay is a focus area and <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-on-gke/blob/main/ray-on-gke/README.md">Terraform templates</a> are available to spin up a multi-team environment with sample security configurations.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*WY1oRpGnazhikqte.jpg" /></figure><p>The final piece on Ray is that of Kueue, a cloud-native queueing system that provides advanced scheduling for Ray applications on GKE. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/using-kuberay-and-kueue-to-orchestrate-ray-applications-in-gke">blog post</a> that shows how KubeRay and Kueue work together to achieve the same.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*q1spCntYfLdXRIC5.png" /></figure><p>Speak of training AI models and the need for NVIDIA GPUs comes up regularly. GKE is probably one of the best choices available to deploy, scale and manage custom ML platforms. In an added boost, GKE can now automatically install NVIDIA GPU drivers. This process was manually done before and the automatic installation now even allows for the drivers to be precompiled for the GKE node, which can reduce the time it takes for GPU nodes to startup. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gke-can-now-automatically-install-nvidia-gpu-drivers">post</a> for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-IfpWIT5x9drgypU.png" /></figure><p>Stanford’s Brain Inferencing Laboratory explore motor systems neuroscience and neuroengineering applications. The relevant data for their research is obtained from experiments on preclininal models and human clinical studies. This data is handled via a complex platform that they have setup for standardized analyses and adhoc analyses. The components of the architecture include Containers, Git, CI/CD and compute clusters, specifically GKE running in Autopilot mode. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/stanford-team-uses-devops-tools-to-manage-research-data">blog post</a> for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/512/0*-ez2Hh1aqKPxtFWz.png" /></figure><h3>Identity and Security</h3><p>This edition is heavy with security updates and let’s begin with zero-day vulnerabilities but what does that mean? A zero-day vulnerability is a security flaw in an application or operating system that has not been discovered, and there is no defense or patch for it. Did you know Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Mandiant showed 97 zero-day vulnerabilities were exploited in 2023. Is that an improvement over 2022 or 2021. Find about this and more in this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/2023-zero-day-trends">post</a>.</p><p>You must have heard about Assured Workloads, which allows companies to run regulated workloads in several Google Cloud’s global regions. Consider the requirement then for your organization to adhere to compliance requirements in more than one geographic region, how do you then use Assured Workloads to create regulatory boundaries using a folder structure? Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-to-set-compliance-controls-for-your-google-cloud-organization">post</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YXPQRu5G853XXc3MRAue6Q.png" /></figure><p>In Google Cloud, we have the Organization resource right at the top in hierarchy. With the creation of this resource, you get access to Organization Policy Service. As part of a new release, a set of organization policies have been released that enforce the need to fix potentially insecure postures. These policies scan across IAM, Storage and Essential Contacts. For e.g. a few of the policies at the IAM level include disabling service account key creation, disabling service account key upload and more. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-stronger-default-org-policies-for-our-customers">post</a> to learn more of these policies that are available to all customers who are creating organization resources and for existing customers, who already have done that, these policies are available with no change required.</p><p>Cloud Armor plays an important role in enabling organizations to create a comprehensive DDOS mitigation strategy for their applications. One of the capabilities that plays a key role is that of rate-limiting via which you can curtail traffic to backend resources based on request volume. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-to-improve-resilience-to-ddos-attacks-with-cloud-armor-advanced-rate-limiting-capabilities">post</a> that highlights the rate-limiting features of Cloud Armor, the two types of actions available for rate-based rules (Throttle, Rate-based ban), planning your rate limiting deployment and more.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gUDRcmgcFoTaX_s0.png" /></figure><p>Handling sensitive data vis-a-vis security, privacy and compliance is an essential requirement for any application handling customer data. Discovery Service, that is part of Google Cloud’s Sensitive Data Protection helps to identify where Sensitive Data resides, which is the first step. Cloud SQL is now supported by the Discovery Service. Earlier it supported BigQuery and BigLake. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/expanding-sensitive-data-protection-to-make-it-easier-to-protect-data-in-cloud-sql">post</a> for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ujrb4T08v6Ekjnth.png" /></figure><p>Software Supply Chain attacks are common and organizations need to bring in strict controls, especially when they modern applications have heavy dependency on open source software. Check out this joint <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-to-choose-a-known-trusted-supplier-for-open-source-software">blog post</a> from Citi and Google, on common open source attack vectors and 3 main criteria to evaluate an OSS vendor.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*s38cJUiBW3x3vtTq.png" /></figure><p>Security will continue to be a big topic at Cloud Next ’24. The 2nd CISO bulletin for March 2024 drops a hint on key security topics and discussion to expect at the conference. In an earlier edition, we had covered the intersection of Gen AI and Security and the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-get-ready-for-next-24-what-you-need-to-know">post</a> seems to point towards that and of course, multiple other security areas that will receive attention during the event. The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-easing-the-psychological-burden-of-leadership">first CISO bulletin for March</a> this month, focused on psychological resilience in cybersecurity leadership.</p><p>To end the security updates, a slightly different area this time but nevertheless an important one. Data shows that Knowledge workers spend an average of 63% of their productive time in the browser and nearly half (48%) of all business-critical applications are now browser-based and more. Given this, organizations would be served well to consider an enterprise ready browser like Chrome Enterprise. Check out a recent report by Enterprise Strategy Group, titled “ <a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/esg-security-report-2023/">Assessing Enterprise Browser Market Dynamics: Why Organizations Are Turning to Enterprise Browsers to More Effectively Secure Modern Work Styles,</a>” and the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/chrome-enterprise/optimize-security-and-productivity-starting-with-the-browser-insights-from-new-report">blog post</a> for more details.</p><h3>Machine Learning</h3><p>The popular Anthropic’s Claude 3 family of models has started to be available on Vertex AI Model Garden. <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/anthropic/model-garden/claude-3-sonnet">Claude 3 Sonnet</a> and <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/anthropic/model-garden/claude-3-haiku">Claude 3 Haiku</a> are generally available to all customers on Vertex AI.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Google Cloud Platform Technology Nuggets — March 1–15, 2024 Edition</h3><p>Welcome to the March 1–15, 2024 edition of Google Cloud Technology Nuggets.</p><p>Please feel free to give <a href="https://forms.gle/UAsAS7YLxYSBTNBy9">feedback</a> on this issue and share the <a href="https://gcptechnuggets.substack.com/">subscription form</a> with your peers.</p><h3>Google Cloud NEXT ’24 Updates</h3><p>Google Cloud NEXT ’24 is just a few weeks away. If you are attending the event in-person, the <a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/session-library?utm_source=cgc-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=FY24-Q2-global-ENDM33-physicalevent-er-next-2024-mc&amp;utm_content=cgc-blog-session-launch-feb&amp;utm_term=-">full list of sessions</a> is now available. You can also make use of the Agenda Builder to plan out attending the sessions that you don’t want to miss. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/full-session-catalog-now-live-for-google-cloud-next24">blog post</a> for more details and check out some of the anticipated sessions mention in the post.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*vsTKI3JJFN9vmIR8.jpg" /></figure><h3>Containers and Kubernetes</h3><p>There are several updates in this space for this edition of the newsletter.</p><p>Solution Architectures are all about tradeoffs isn’t it? Regional or a Zonal cluster for your GKE environments? You have to consider multiple points like availability, costs, maintenance, scalability and more. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/choosing-a-regional-vs-zonal-gke-cluster">detailed article</a> that breaks down each of these points vis-a-vis Regional and Zonal clusters.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PCTIhE45lk5Gpe84ydZiuA.png" /></figure><p>Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in Autopilot mode is seeing significant updates of late to make it ideally suited to running your AI workloads, not just from the manageability perspective but from the choice of compute options. There are two new compute classes in Autopilot that have been introduced: Accelerator and Performance. The Accelerator class improves GPU support with resource reservation capabilities. The Performance class enables high-performance workloads to run on Autopilot mode at scale. There are several pricing updates too, including a price cut for majority of GPU workloads running on GKE in Autopilot mode, along with the ability to keep your existing Reservations and committed use discounts, as you move your workloads between the Standard and Autopilot modes of GKE, as well as between Compute Engine VMs. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/new-features-to-run-ai-more-efficiently-on-fully-managed-gke">post</a> for more details.</p><p>Have you heard about ECK? It is Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes and the official Elastic Operator for Kubernetes. If you are looking to run the Elastic Stack on a cloud-native Kubernetes environment, then this is the way to go. Combine that with running it on GKE in Autopilot mode, and the combination gets the best of both services. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gke-autopilot-supports-elastic-cloud-on-kubernetes">blog post</a> for more details.</p><p>Looking to create an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) for your teams, as part of Platform Engineering, you need to consider a foundation that can provide flexibility in terms of the requirements that your developers would have. Kubernetes is a solid foundation to do that due to the abstractions that it has available. But building one is a significant task and there is good help here in terms of the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gke-build-an-enterprise-developer-platform-for-fast-app-delivery">blog post</a> and a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/enterprise-application-blueprint">detailed solution guide</a>. Check it out.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gkFV7tQu5_qr2DcI.png" /></figure><p>One more post that highlights the GKE Autopilot value proposition and this time it is about how it handles security for you. In summary, it helps you configure nodes, node pools, and in-cluster policy for you according to security best practices, allowing you to focus on workload-specific security. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/move-in-ready-kubernetes-security-with-gke-autopilot">informative article</a> to brush up on Kubernetes security aspects and what Autopilot mode does for you, as part of the shared fate operating model.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/991/0*NrHMWPCs6N1SpxGD.png" /></figure><h3>Customers</h3><p>You are going through an application modernization journey at your organization and the initial applications that you have containerized and moved to Cloud Run have been a success. On top of that, you have achieved some of these numbers: 70% toil reduction, 90% cost savings, and unlocked new capabilities by integrating with some of the services available on Google Cloud? This is exactly what DZ Bank, the second largest bank in Germany in terms of assets, has published. Check out their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/how-dz-bank-uses-a-cloud-run-first-approach-to-unlock-big-savings">story</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*OAIjCEqjo-cyfYrB.png" /></figure><p>Another customer success is from Glance, which provides innovative lock screen experiences across millions of mobile phones. Glance recently migrated their database from Azure Cosmos DB to Cloud Spanner. The move was needed due to the frequent need to optimize their application vis-a-vis the database requirements and operations management too. To select a database, they conducted a month-long proof of concept with various databases to ensure that their pipelines worked along with their performance requirements. Spanner emerged as the Database of choice. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/why-glance-migrated-its-document-database-to-spanner">post</a> that discusses their experience, reasons for moving, what Spanner provides them and more.</p><h3>Identity and Security</h3><p>Security Command Center Enterprise edition has been announced. It fuses cloud and enterprise security requirements into a single offering that you can use across your multi-cloud environments. The edition is integrated with various aspects of Mandiant solutions too. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-security-command-center-enterprise">blog</a> for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/633/0*I9Y9h6q2o4Tyy3GT.png" /></figure><p>The first of Google Cloud Security Talks of 2024 have started. By the time, this newsletter reaches out, the first edition on March 13 would have completed. You can still visit the on-demand page and view the sessions. There are several interesting topics around Gen AI and its role in security along with regular updates on threat intelligence. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/join-our-first-security-talks-of-2024">post</a> for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*MR9muIji4V4p43Nk.png" /></figure><h3>Machine Learning</h3><p>The rate at which the Gen AI foundational models are being made available by various providers is astounding. Speaking of Anthropic’s Claude 3 models, they are soon going to be available on Vertex AI Model Garden, with one of the models (Sonnet), which is best combination of skills and speed is now available in private preview for customers. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-anthropics-claude-3-models-in-google-cloud-vertex-ai">blog post</a> on this announcement.</p><p>It is generally accepted now that while foundational models are more than capable, the way forward is to have a specialized model for your domain. But which approach should you use to specialize it. Should you use Prompt Engineering, RAG or Fine tuning? Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/three-step-design-pattern-for-specializing-llms">post</a> that gives you an overview of these approaches and a side-by-side comparison.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*J4deyAgU8O-5w6ip.png" /></figure><h3>Databases</h3><p>As Organizations continue to grapple with how to maximize capabilities with Gen AI, the fundamental point remains that you will need to have ability to access, manage, and activate all types of data. What this means for Cloud Providers is to assess this development and see how their own services around Database products stands and adding native Gen AI capabilities within the products itself. In a key blog post that highlights how Google Cloud has expanded the GenAI capabilities across key products like BigQuery, AlloyDB, Spanner and more is noteworthy. With this capabilities, your usage of cross services goes up but then the data and governance can be better managed. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/bigquery-and-alloydb-hit-major-milestone-with-ai-enabled-updates">blog post</a> in details that highlights some of these developments.</p><p>In a similar key <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/discover-new-gen-ai-google-cloud-database-capabilities">post</a>, read about announcements around general availability (GA) of AlloyDB AI, an integrated set of capabilities in AlloyDB to easily build Enterprise Gen AI apps and introduction of vector search capabilities across Spanner, MySQL, and Redis. There is also an increasing integration with LangChain across these features.</p><p>Speaking of LangChain integrations, the key question is what are the LangChain packages that leverage these new Google Cloud database features. The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/build-rag-applications-with-langchain-and-google-cloud">blog post</a> highlights the packages around Document Loaders, Vector Stores and Chat Messages Memory. If you are developer who is using the popular LangChain framework and wants to try out these Google Database integrations, this is a must read post to show you the path. The post has Getting Started guides too.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2gPRX0o17wqXWp76Xunzug.png" /></figure><p>Several blog posts have been specifically written on the various database services, their support for Gen AI, LangChain frameworks and how you can start building out applications with them. Here is a list:</p><ul><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/cloud-sql-for-mysql-supports-vector-embeddings-search">Build generative AI applications with similarity search in Cloud SQL for MySQL</a></li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bCpR7SqNqrYHOAkYH-LIUg.png" /></figure><ul><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/memorystore-for-redis-vector-search-and-langchain-integration">Memorystore for Redis vector search and LangChain integrations for Gen AI</a></li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*W-wx29VN7b5sbWxa.png" /></figure><ul><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/how-spanner-vector-search-supports-generative-ai-apps">Build generative AI and similarity search applications at virtually unlimited scale with Spanner</a></li></ul><p>Finally, if you are using Cloud SQL for SQL Server, you can now run build and run SSRS reports with databases hosted on Cloud SQL for SQL Server.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A selection of Duet AI in Google Cloud materials that are worth your attention.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/316/0*w5mOtHVpRnSxVAuK.png" /></figure><p><strong>Developer and Operational Productivity in Google Cloud with Duet AI</strong></p><p>This is an excellent session that can be one that you can use both for your own understanding and also across the organization. It manages to cover a whole range of topics from developer productivity, what problem Duet AI addresses, key areas that Duet AI can help out developers and demonstrations of the same. I liked the take on how Developer Productivity, which if boosted through tools like Duet AI, can directly influence positive business outcomes.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FjpmmC6GATRc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DjpmmC6GATRc&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FjpmmC6GATRc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/dabc080d9919caeef91a71ef036024f2/href">https://medium.com/media/dabc080d9919caeef91a71ef036024f2/href</a></iframe><p><strong>Code Vipassana Season 5 Session 3: Duet AI to accelerate test driven development</strong></p><p>Test Driven Development is a key methodology when working with an existing code base and then introducing new functionality. Duet AI is well suited to this since it supports you with Code explanaibility, code generation, test case generation and documentation. If you get this technique right and Duet AI works well, you are bound to see a good productivity improvement and still ensuring a code % of code coverage. This session uses the Ruby language, so a good way for you to even check out how well Duet AI supports the language.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FOIv68OWuEXk&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DOIv68OWuEXk&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FOIv68OWuEXk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/1242d4c64c964685bb3a78f443212061/href">https://medium.com/media/1242d4c64c964685bb3a78f443212061/href</a></iframe><p><strong>Duet AI for building a Chrome Extension app in JavaScript</strong></p><p>This is an interesting session from Code Vipassana Season 5 again. This time, you build out a Chrome Extension with Duet AI’s assistance. The essence of such a session is to show that you could pretty use Duet AI for a wide variety of tasks. Often folks ask this question on how well Duet AI will work for a specific language, framework or task? The usual answer that I give is … try it.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fp8_m6bG3iwQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dp8_m6bG3iwQ&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fp8_m6bG3iwQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/23163a0dd7a395db11470ef20d704cf0/href">https://medium.com/media/23163a0dd7a395db11470ef20d704cf0/href</a></iframe><p>👉 For all Duet AI resources, check out the Github Repo: <a href="https://lnkd.in/deY9zWn9">https://lnkd.in/deY9zWn9</a></p><p>👉 If you’d like to share an article you wrote or came across on Duet AI, please submit to the repo and/or share in the comments.</p><p>👉 If you’d consider sharing a blog on <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud">Google Cloud Community publication</a>, do reach out.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=298196dbd3c8" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/duet-ai-in-google-cloud-material-worth-looking-at-this-week-march-4-2024-298196dbd3c8">Duet AI in Google Cloud material worth looking at this week: March 4, 2024</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud">Google Cloud - Community</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has never been a better time to be a software developer. You’ve heard that enough … right? I truly believe so. With the advent of AI Code Assistants / AI Pair Programmer or other similar terms to describe the same thing, where does that leave software developers?</p><p>There is a camp that says that AI will take away software developer jobs? We’ve also been hearing that our younger generation should no longer learn programming? There are folks on the other side, who say that these AI code assistants are going to help the software developer get better? I believe that each of these views have some truth to it but the context and details matter. In this article, I am here to highlight the view <strong>“AI Code Assistants are going to help the software developer get better”</strong></p><p>Let’s cut through the noise first and dig a little deeper into what do we mean when we say that AI assistants are going to help the software developers get <strong>better</strong> or more <strong>efficient</strong> in doing their <strong>jobs</strong>. I have intentionally highlighted the words : better, efficient and jobs.</p><p>The word “better” and “efficient” is something that I will interpret as a given because any help that the assistants give to do our jobs, will be a positive outcome. And with every strong trend, like the one we are seeing now with AI Code Assistants, we are likely to see increasing investments and once the hype is settled and as adoption grows, we all benefit from these tools getting better and better at what they do.</p><p>So, lets move on to the 3rd word in there : jobs. It begs the question, What is the job of a software developer? We are likely to get tons of views again over there and my goal in this article is to highlight a couple of surveys that flip the question around “what are the jobs or tasks that software developers would like the AI Code Assistants to do?”. That should give us a good glimpse into not just the kind of activities that a developer does, but areas where they are hinting they need help to get more of it done in less time, more efficiently, faster, etc.</p><p>First up, is the RedMonk study titled “10 Things Developers Want from AI Code Assistants” (November 2023)</p><p><a href="https://redmonk.com/kholterhoff/2023/11/01/10-things-developers-want-from-ai-code-assistants/">10 Things Developers Want from AI Code Assistants</a></p><p>I have taken the liberty here to summarize this into a table given below:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ol51ceGXYaYh9rXM6tSCvw.png" /></figure><p>Check out another survey, this time from <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#developer-tools-ai-tool">Stack Overflow (2023 Developer Survey)</a>. The chart below looks at what developers are using it for.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FZUE6u4LJlm--DHDELxJ9w.png" /></figure><p>The next chart presents an interesting view (what they plan or would be interested in using it for):</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y7NoPFHnvjwttDQxckmeCQ.png" /></figure><p>It would be fair to say that 3 areas that commonly come up from this are:</p><ol><li>Code Generation</li><li>Testing</li><li>Understanding Code, Documenting it, Getting information</li></ol><p>One can argue what is new in all of this? You did not need this trend to identify tasks that the software developers were supposed to be doing in any case.</p><p>This brings me to the point that I wish to highlight in this article and its clearly addressed to Managers, who are leading software development teams. The surveys above clearly shows that today, teams are using AI code assistants in multiple areas and/or are planning to use it. Getting help to get better at their roles, getting more work done efficiently, while still focusing on quality can have a transformative impact on the team.</p><h4>Call to Action</h4><p>You should look at investing your time into understanding and using these tools today in your team. Chances are that some of your developers are already familiar with them, have given them a try and have interesting data to share. The recommended approach would be to look at building out a Proof of Concept application utilising these tools, understand areas (both the most requested ones and even others from the list above) where the tools are making a positive difference. Do keep in mind that these tools are not perfect and have limitations, so look at their outputs carefully.</p><p>Happy Developers lead to positive business outcomes and the AI Code Assistants can play a big role in making the development process better and more efficient.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a0f88f58abf3" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Google Cloud Platform Technology Nuggets — February 16–29, 2024 Edition</h3><p>Welcome to the February 16–29, 2024 edition of Google Cloud Technology Nuggets.</p><p>Please feel free to give <a href="https://forms.gle/UAsAS7YLxYSBTNBy9">feedback</a> on this issue and share the <a href="https://gcptechnuggets.substack.com/">subscription form</a> with your peers.</p><h3>Google Cloud NEXT ’24</h3><p>Google Cloud NEXT ’24 is just around the corner. The event will be held from April 9–11, 2024 in Las Vegas and there are likely to be some cool announcements. In the meanwhile, check out the entire <a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/session-library">session catalog.</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*BFf2x6kQg38AI54P.jpg" /></figure><h3>Fifth “epoch” of computing</h3><p>This is an excellent article that you should read that goes through various epochs or transitions in the last 50+ years. Each of these epochs have been transformative and the article argues that we are currently in the fifth epoch of computing, one that is data-centric, declarative, outcome-oriented, software-defined, and centered on proactively bringing insights to people. This epoch is supposed to be the most transformative and brings with it key challenges too. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/systems/the-fifth-epoch-of-distributed-computing">article</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/836/0*GUUFXXj1g4vHDHNg.jpg" /></figure><h3>Infrastructure and Modernization of environments</h3><p>If you have been using Compute Engine, you know that you can start and stop the Compute Engine instances. However this feature was not available if you used Managed Instance Groups (MIGs). This has been addressed now with the release of the standby pool feature in MIGs. A standby pool can be configured to contain the target size of the suspended and stopped VMs. This pool can be managed manually or via an automated fashion when the MIGs size is increased. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-managed-instance-groups-standby-pool">article</a> for more details and how you can start using this cost-saving feature today.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Asnvdm4PULWTtK-p.png" /></figure><p>Mainframes conjure up a very different era of computing. But for its time, organizations who used the technology setup a centralized way of controlling the access, security, operations and setup layers of processes since resources were scarce. With these organizations undergoing a transformation and embarking on a mainframe modernization journey, they have to adopt the ways of the cloud, especially when using a Cloud provider that provides managed services, where security is a shared responsibility, where application errors are only within the realm of the customer to understand and more. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure-modernization/why-mainframe-migration-is-more-than-technology-transformation">article</a> that highlights why mainframe modernization is not just technology transformation but also of people and processes.</p><p>And continuing on the theme of modernization, its interesting to see how Contact Center Technology completely transformed the IVR systems of old. The earliest adopters of this were the Telecom providers that integrated their systems with the modern Contact Center Software. But with the advent of GenAI, this space is again ripe for a transformation of a different kind. One that will see more intelligent agents that allow a more natural interaction, grounding of the models with the Organizations knowledge base via RAG techniques and more. Check out <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/telecommunications/how-generative-ai-can-be-used-in-the-contact-center">how contact centers are being transformed with Generative AI</a>.</p><h3>API Management</h3><p>Apigee and GKE represent the best of services out there in Google Cloud. But often, you need to connect the API layer to your backend services running on GKE in a secure fashion. For security reasons, you do not want to expose the GKE services publicly plus setting up private and secure connections is an administrative overhead. Enter Private Service Connect (PSC) and GKE Gateway to help address that. Read this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/using-private-service-connect-for-apigee-gke-connectivity">article</a> for more details on these services and how to configure a secure and private connection that bridges your API layer to the GKE services.</p><h3>Customers</h3><p>Symphony provides solutions that manage collaborations across worldwide financial institutions and typically this would mean millions of messages across their platform on a daily basis. Their original solution was based on HBase and that turned quickly into a signficant overhead in terms of running the clusters and managing them. This article covers their move to Bigtable, the reasons for choosing it and how they planned the migration. The result is significant cost savings and operational efficiencies at scale. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/symphony-connects-financial-markets-with-bigtable">article</a> for more details.</p><h3>Identity and Security</h3><p>Still using Service Account Keys at scale? If yes, security findings continue to report that one of the primary causes of security breaches are related to Service Account Keys. As an organization, you have to step up the game on preventing service account key generation and there are ways to address this in a systematic way with help from specific features in Google Cloud. You can look at Organization policies that prevent Service Account key creation and also detect/alert on instances of Org Policy changes and Service Account key creation. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/want-your-cloud-to-be-more-secure-stop-using-service-account-keys">article</a> on how to do that.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*HGg8gQjX7F4ngJgn.png" /></figure><p>Continuing on the topic of preventive measures that need to be taken to avoid issues in the future, the same applies to Vertex AI services. With organizations taking on a more proactive role for using AI services in their applications, you need to have Organization Policies in place to govern the usage of Vertex AI services. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-security-command-center-protection-for-vertex-ai">article</a> for more details, that also highlights how Security Command Center Premium can help detect instances of these activities.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ebgpfl__GIBhwYdO.jpg" /></figure><p>In the <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cloud-lateral-movement-techniques">recent blog</a>, Palo Alto Networks highlights several techniques that exploit misconfigurations which could allow a malicious actor to move laterally in cloud environments. The interesting thing about this blog is how bad actors can potentially use tools that are essential for administrating the environments and the machines in them. For e.g. you would think that taking backups, SSH Keys and access to serial console are essential utilities and while that is true, seldom does one think of how bad actors could utilize them to compromise your cloud environment. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-to-prevent-lateral-movement-techniques-on-google-cloud">article</a> that gives 3 key examples with steps on how the attackers would go about compromising the systems and what you can do in Google Cloud to prevent that. Essential read for anyone managing Google Cloud environments.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zjKIIJAR-swmqldJupQdIw.png" /></figure><p>There are couple of CISO reports in this edition. The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-guidance-from-our-latest-threat-horizons-report">first report</a> highlights the threats that Google Cloud continues to see and will likely be the trend for 2024. Its interesting to note that one of the biggest threats emerges from the organization’s own security hygiene and misconfigurations. So something that the organizations should pay more attention to.</p><p>The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-building-better-cyber-defenses-with-ai">second report</a> focuses on the fact that AI will actually play a solid role in strengthening our security posture. The report goes into a session at the recent Munich security conference where this topic was dealt in detail.</p><h3>Machine Learning</h3><p>The biggest news in this edition in the Machine Learning space has been the release of Gemma, a family of lightweight, state-of-the art open models. These models that are based on the same technology as Gemini are available in two sizes: Gemma 2B and Gemma 7B. The key thing with these models is their open nature. Gemma models can run on a laptop, workstation, or on Google Cloud. You can build with and customize in Vertex AI and run it on GKE. Developers can use Gemma with their preferred tools/frameworks that includes Colab and Kaggle notebooks, JAX, PyTorch, Keras 3.0, and Hugging Face Transformers. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/gemma-model-available-in-vertex-ai-and-via-gke">article</a> for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*HzZ-XtpXH4iPkQyQ.jpg" /></figure><p>Imagine a scenario where you are watching a video of a famous chef preparing your favourite recipe. As the chef is mentioning the ingredients, they are automatically inserted into a shopping cart that you can then order right away. This is one such scenario that is possible when you combine the interesting world of Video Analytics with Generative AI capabilities. This <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/how-video-analytics-and-generative-ai-will-reshape-industries">article</a> highlights this intersection and mentions interesting use cases with demos. It is sure to spark some ideas.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*kHvhywiqFtX9Rx_d.png" /></figure><h3>Databases</h3><p>Have you been considering moving to Spanner PostgreSQL dialect with the announcement of its General Availability. If specifically you are looking to move from a PostgreSQL environment that you are managing, you should check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/migrate-from-postgresql-to-spanner-with-minimal-downtime">detailed guide</a> that shows not just the benefits of moving to it but a step by step guide to doing that, using the Spanner Migration Tool (SMT) that makes the task smooth.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/977/0*o5sUJJZJypjxW7QV.png" /></figure><h3>Data Analytics</h3><p>Google Cloud with its Data Analytics services can be difficult at times to combine together to form an overall solution. In an interesting Data Analytics solution that is worth studying, Deustche Bank built out a Trade Surveillance system. The system made good use of BigQuery and Dataproc services as shown in the diagram below. What’s interesting to note is how the problem was broken down into how the front office system would provide the relevant data on which the various surveillance scenarios were then run and were identified for investigation. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/deutsche-bank-uses-bigquery-and-dataproc-for-trade-surveillance">article</a> for more details.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*RdlySgty6wgACpVj.png" /></figure><h3>Games</h3><p>Is there an area that Generative AI will not touch? Let’s talk about Games, where the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gaming/the-case-for-running-ml-in-the-cloud-for-live-service-games">article</a> believes that it has a great potential in the following use cases: Game production, Adaptive gameplay and In-game advertising.</p><p>The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gaming/the-case-for-running-ml-in-the-cloud-for-live-service-games">article</a> also dives into <a href="https://github.com/googleforgames/GenAI-quickstart">Generative AI Framework for Games</a>, which provides templates for running Gen AI for games on Google Cloud, as well as a framework for data ingest and storage to support these live models. The article covers a demo of the same.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZLOLfkH59wvehtmg.png" /></figure><h3>Networking</h3><p>A new internal range (IP net block for a VPC network) API aims to simplify management of private IP addresses. This API allows for allocate subnets from a free address range within your VPC, reserve and protect this range with a Google Cloud Network and reserve / protect on-premises, or cross-cloud ranges. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/introducing-internal-range-api">article</a> with various use cases on where this feature is useful.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*O3wZv0J13mGxxR17KIbhAA.png" /></figure><h3>Developers and Practitioners</h3><p>The last few months has seen Google release several updates to the Vertex AI models, starting with PaLM and then the Gemini models. You might have invoked these models from an API or SDK and even exercised some of the multi-modal features of Gemini. But what if you had a scenario where you are given a list of items (for e.g. countries) and you need to run the same query(prompt) on each of the item. As the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/vertex-ai-palm-and-gemini-apis-using-workflows">article</a>, rightly points out, you might end up with the context length issue if you send all the data in one prompt or you might end up sequentially invoking the model on each data. How about being able to do that in parallel and with an approach that can scale. The solution: Use Cloud Workflows as the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/vertex-ai-palm-and-gemini-apis-using-workflows">article</a> effectively demonstrates.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*p0lM8aa_gnIF8Ypi.png" /></figure><p>The best way to get started with any technology is to take the services for a spin, integrate the functionality into your applications or build out prototypes of new applications. Customers have identified key Gen AI applications that have an immediate return for them. These include modernizing web sites, improving developer productivity, product cataloging and more. Check out this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/generative-ai-code-samples-for-vertex-ai">article</a> that highlights each of these key areas and provides ready made repositories of these Gen AI applications that you can put to work together. If you are a Developer in this space and working with Google Cloud, this is a repository to study next.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZZht8fawuXxi1Oa9B3CeGw.png" /></figure><h3>Learn Google Cloud</h3><p>Cross-Cloud Network is a solution that addresses the need from organizations to be able to build multi tier apps and network them regardless where ever they are. Key use cases for Cross-Cloud Network solution include distributed applications, content delivery, hybrid workforce solutions and more. Check out the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/connect-google-cloud-to-on-prem-and-other-clouds">article</a> to learn more about this solution.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*FY5oevzqD6I_YgRQ.jpg" /></figure><h3>Stay in Touch</h3><p>Have questions, comments, or other feedback on this newsletter?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have done a fair bit of blogging and managing blogs over the years and would like to take this opportunity to address some of the key questions/points that I am asked around blogging.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*YB-abF0rtPAtEtei.png" /><figcaption>Image Reference : <a href="https://creazilla.com/nodes/1717346-book-hand-pen-illustration">https://creazilla.com/nodes/1717346-book-hand-pen-illustration</a></figcaption></figure><p>I have categorized these frequently asked questions/concerns/doubts and have put down my thoughts for each of them. I respect each of these questions/points and I want to share my experience that can help you cross that bridge.</p><h3>I have not written before / Not good at writing</h3><p>There is always a first time. The most popular bloggers also started with their first post and look where they are now. We have all started somewhere, stumbled and got along.</p><p>The tools to get writing today have never been better and easier. Writing is a great way to improve and share your knowledge. Consider this as an opportunity and get started.</p><p>This point is coupled usually with the fact that most folks stay away from written communication stating that they are not good at writing. Some say their hold on the language that they wish to communicate in is not good. A few have remarked that “English is not my forte”.</p><p>To be honest, none of us are experts in any language or communication. Ask anyone who reads stuff online, that they are looking to learn, to get inspired, looking to connect to the ideas and perfect written communication is not something that they are looking for. This is not some school/college exam where you are going to get penalized for some grammar mistakes. If in doubt, use online tools to help you structure some of your statements. I can vouch that all of us who are reading your article do not give a second look to your perfectly crafted statements. So get your stories in place, because that matters and the words will help support it, perfect grammar or not.</p><h3>Start blogging</h3><p>One of my most enjoyable and importantly learning experience while blogging came from my writing at Programmable Web. Thank you John Musser and Adam DuVander for the opportunity. Over a period of a few years, I ended up covering 100s of artciles covering API News. As a side note, APIs still rule :-)</p><p>I remember that since covering this kind of news was new to me, I asked my editor, Adam, if I could first observe a few posts for a week or two and then start blogging. Adam caught that immediately and I distinctly remember him telling me that you just have to get started and that he will help to review and give feedback. That gave me a lot of confidence and indirectly it underlined the fact that you have to get in the water, if you have to swim.</p><p>So in essence, just like any other task, get started with, get your work reviewed, folks are there to make your writing better and soon you will get the framework that helps you create the posts.</p><p>Its perfectly fine to be a bit afraid about your first post, how it will be received but you have to get started. That is something that you have to do.</p><h3>Which topic to write about?</h3><p>You might be lucky if you are planning to write for a publication that has highlighted a few key topics on which they are looking out for articles. If those articles are in areas that you are already knowledgable about or are interested to explore, then it makes it easier.</p><p>But a majority of us may not have that data. In that case, my suggestion is to pick a topic that you are passionate about or are familiar with and which might be a more comfortable thing to start with. If you are working with a set of tools, languages, platforms at your work, that could be a good source to tap into also.</p><p>As script writers say, the stories are all around us and this is true when it comes to you. You definitely have a few topics that you can talk about. Just tap into those.</p><h3>This topic has been covered multiple times!!!</h3><p>This is a point that I have seen most folks new to blogging get discouraged by. They mention that the topic has been covered a lot by others, there is nothing new to cover here and a lot of overthinking starts.</p><p>My response to that is “Who cares?” . You can interpret my answer in a couple of ways. One would be to assume that I am asking you to write and not bother about anyone. But my real point when I say “Who cares?” is to actually understand that there are several folks who are interested in what you may write. You have a different view or style that the other 999 folks who have written on the topic. What matters is that you got out of the blocks, got a post in front of the world and I can assure you that there are folks who will read and benefit from your post. They do care about what you write, they will be investing their time in reading your post and might even learn a thing or not. So you focus on the what you can control i.e. the blog post and let the world know that you have written the post.</p><h3>I have an idea but am struggling to write!</h3><p>This is a valid concern and one that each one of us face, even if we have written 100s of blog posts. You know the drill : you have an idea or topic in your mind, you know the material and yet struggle to put a structure to the blog to get you started. Often called writer’s block but we don’t need to make things that complicated.</p><p>One of my first editors, when I wrote for Wrox publications in the year 2000, told me that it is very simple to write an article or a chapter for a book. The steps are as follows:</p><ol><li>You tell the audience what you are going to cover.</li><li>You cover it.</li><li>You tell the audience what you have covered.</li></ol><p>Simple … isn’t it? It does illustrate effectively that you could possibly use the above structure as a guide to get going. In my case, what really helps us when I write technical articles is to <strong>get my application code working</strong>. Once that is ready, I tell the folks what I am going to cover, then describe the working code and conclude by what they have seen. Try that the next time.</p><p>I don’t think there is a magic formula but be prepared to have your own tool available to write down ideas, points, etc that you may get anytime of the day. If you are planning a series of articles, put down the topics in a list that you would prefer to cover and then tackle them topic by topic. Divide and Conquer or breaking it down into immediate targets is also another strategy that has worked well for me.</p><h3>I am afraid of how my material will be accepted?</h3><p>The fear of feedback is real for all for us. I am not going to say that its easy and we need to be cool about that. Feedback is essential to improve and feedback at times can hurt your confidence. The same applies not just to writing but also to conference / event talks that you do.</p><p>I always believe that its essential to do a few things first. If you are going to talk and write in public, make sure that you are putting in your best effort into the material. As long as your process is sincere and its the best that you could do, you are a success.</p><p>An approach you can try is to have a few trusted folks that you can reach out to for review. If you are writing a book or for a popular publication, chances are that there is already a process where your work is reviewed before being approved for publication. If you are writing on your own blog, reach out to a few folks, who you believe would give you feedback from multiple angles. Take that feedback seriously, see what you can incorporate and then publish your article.</p><p>Worst case, what might happen? Someone might point out that they did not like the article? Ask them if there are areas that you could improve. Others may point that there are incorrect things in the blog post. Ask them to point them out and correct the blog post. The fact that you accepted some errors on your part (not intentional) and still went ahead and corrected it with feedback, is a great asset.</p><p>In one of the books that I wrote, one individual actually read the book page by page and incorporated suggestions/fixes across the book and highlighted in detail where the problems were. This was not from the book publishers reviewers but from someone in the general public. So be positive and you will be amazed to see genuine feedback from folks who recognize that you have put in the effort to share your knowledge on something new/recent and are willing to help fix it to make it more useful to others.</p><p>There will be your share of feedback which will be like a punch or might even sound rude. Even in those circumstances, see if there are any suggestions in there to improve or is it just a rant. For e.g. I was given feedback that one of my books was the worst technical book that has ever been published but with no other feedback. I moved on to the next feedback … we have to. That didn’t prevent me for continuing to write and share stuff that I like.</p><h3>What kind of format?</h3><p>This is an interesting point and one that I believe if addressed well can bring more people to blogs. Giving an example from the technical world, you should not be restricted or assume that technical blogs can be of a certain type or format only.</p><p>You can write a technical blog:</p><ul><li>Informational on the topic</li><li>Quick How to or Getting Started on the topic</li><li>A codelab that folks can try on the topic</li><li>Share a cool talk that you heard, an article you read, etc.</li><li>Summarize a few articles to read that you found useful and believe that others would benefit.</li><li>A competitive study that you have done about one tool/tech v/s the other.</li><li>Built an interesting tool or project. Open it up on Github and share it via a blog post.</li><li>Implemented a cool feature in your recent project. Write about it.</li><li>Fixed a tough problem. Help others who might be facing a similar issue with your solution.</li></ul><p>There are additional formats than the ones listed above. The takeaway point is that there is no right or wrong format. Not all formats may even be relevant to all your readers. You might not be comfortable writing about some of these formats. It’s completely fine. Pick one that you can start with.</p><h3>Just ask for help</h3><p>The power of the community is often underestimated by most of us. We also grossly underestimate the number of folks, who are ready to help out with their feedback and guidance. But that can only happen if you take the first step and just ask them. Feel free to reach out to your inner circle, trusted circle, folks you know give you constructive feedback when you are taking your first few steps in this. In fact, even as someone who is used to blogging, I end up reaching out to few folks on certain topics or a particular blog post that I’d like them to review first. There are plenty of good folks out there, who know more on most topics than each one of us. So as long you are comfortable and accepting of that fact, help is just a message away.</p><h3>Its an investment of my time. I need to get paid.</h3><p>This is a fair point and I would leave it to each one of you individually to decide if you want to get compensated for each blog post that you write. You need to consider publications that you can write for, which may give you a token amount for each blog post. On the other hand, if you are writing at your own blog, you do have a choice of earning some income from it (the amounts may not be astronomic but you have the option). Examples of this include Medium which has a member only stories option or at your personal blog, you could use some relevant Ads.</p><p>In my experience, every blog that I have written has paid me back several times (whether I was paid for it or not). It has paid me back in becoming a better writer, able to communicate technical terms better, got me valuable readers that give me feedback, opened up opportunities via folks reaching out vis-a-vis the topic that I have written and more. So keep a long term view in terms of multiple returns that you will get for your time investment.</p><p>There is a big difference between someone holding a job and doing blogging occasionally and someone who does blogging/reporting/technical writing for a living. The latter definitely will look at avenues that can sustain them and getting paid for it is a high priority for them.</p><h3>Why should I blog?</h3><p>If you have been reading this article and reached this section, I don’t think you need this section since you have your own judgement on how blogging is useful.</p><p>I personally believe that blogging regularly has benefits and all of which I may not be able to list down here or do justice to them via examples. Here are some points from my experience:</p><ul><li>It helps me or forces me in a good way to learn more about a topic. Its similar to teaching a class. It will make you read a bit more, try out ways to explain a topic, makes you double check a few things and more.</li><li>It definitely helps to improve your communication skills. Written skills are important or have never been as important as they are today, given the age of Gen AI tools that we live in today.</li></ul><p>All the best for your blogging journey. Do share in your own experiences that got you started and any other tips/advice that you may have for writers.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=641d424bf064" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

The areas covered include understanding existing code bases, code refactoring, migrating to new languages/framework. Duet AI can play a good assistive role here. Check out the <a href="https://seroter.com/2024/02/21/how-id-use-generative-ai-to-modernize-an-app/">article</a>.</li><li><strong>Test-Driven Development with Java, Spring Boot and Duet AI in GCP</strong> by <a href="https://medium.com/@ddobrin?source=post_page-----3bb6fd4d0822--------------------------------"><strong>Dan Dobrin</strong></a>: Any developer out there will agree that a good part of their work is to take existing code bases and add new functionality to it. The key tasks there would be to get a good understanding of the code and then introduce new functionality in the right places. And when it comes to adding new functionality, how about a Test Driven Development approach to building that out? Dan Dobrin covers exactly that in a <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/test-driven-development-with-java-spring-boot-and-duet-ai-in-gcp-3bb6fd4d0822">detailed article</a> that takes an existing repository and takes you through the steps of how you would use Duet AI as your assistant in that task.</li><li><strong>Explore Duet AI to assist with React frontend application development</strong> by <a href="https://medium.com/@rickruguichen?source=post_page-----cc39df3ce7d9--------------------------------"><strong>Rick Chen</strong></a><strong> : </strong>It is my observation that a lot of articles that cover Duet AI are focused on backend frameworks or core programming languages and that seems to be give an impression that Duet AI is probably well suited to those tasks only. First up, check out a l<a href="https://cloud.google.com/duet-ai/docs/developers/supported-languages">ist of Programming Languages and Interfaces</a> that Duet AI supports. Next up, for all you React framework users and there are plenty of them, check out this article by Rick Chen on how to use Duet AI to help us with React and TypeScript to build a client-side web app. The <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/explore-duet-ai-to-assist-with-react-frontend-appldevelopment-cc39df3ce7d9">article</a> explores its assistive features in the areas of bootstrapping the app, async communication, styling and more.</li></ul><p>👉 For all Duet AI resources, check out the Github Repo: <a href="https://lnkd.in/deY9zWn9">https://lnkd.in/deY9zWn9</a></p><p>👉 If you’d like to share an article you wrote or came across on Duet AI, please submit to the repo and/or share in the comments.</p><p>👉 If you’d consider sharing a blog on <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud">Google Cloud Community publication</a>, do reach out.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ddd8b313794c" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/duet-ai-in-google-cloud-material-worth-looking-at-this-week-feb-26-24-ddd8b313794c">Duet AI in Google Cloud material worth looking at this week: Feb 26, ‘24</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud">Google Cloud - Community</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Book Review : The Good Enough Job by Simone Stolzoff</h3><p>This is a book review on <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Good-Enough-Job-What-First/dp/1529146305/ref=sr_1_1?crid=86P6XC5YB5ZK&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.os8dbmYAd5qoVpTe40Nx-qTumkvcfmi_J1672iuOC_nGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.84iJS5CuaD8cy6ObqFt-OjgC52zCX1Fk05GX2TzEmAc">The Good Enough Job: What We Gain When We Don’t Put Work First by Simone Stolzoff</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/341/0*RNZYV83Ns-RvXx_d.jpg" /></figure><p>This book starts on a solid note with a question to you that goes something like “Who are you?”. I don’t know how you will answer that question but often, as the author notes, we usually define ourselves with our current job/role.</p><p>This question is one that I have struggled to answer myself and most importantly, battled for a long time now to disconnect my identity vis-a-vis my work life.</p><p>Simone takes a refreshing approach to this topic in keeping the content real and away from a preachy and theoretical treatise by covering each chapter to bust a work myth via real people and their life stories. I particularly liked this style since it kept me engaged and identify at times with what each of the folks in the story were going through.</p><p>The work myths that are addressed effectively are:</p><ul><li>We are what we do</li><li>Your job can be your God</li><li>Dream jobs</li><li>Your work is your worth</li><li>Workplace can be your family</li><li>Working more hours always leads to better work</li><li>Cushy office perks</li><li>Status equals success</li><li>Personal boundaries</li></ul><p>I have never believed in some of the points above and it was good to see similar experiences with folks in the stories covered.</p><p>I believe this book is a timely reminder to all of us to figure out our identity , that is not intervened with our work. Easier said than done but something that is an important topic to me of late.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=acd571e0b6bc" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>
