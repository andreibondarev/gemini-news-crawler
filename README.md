This is a News Slurper that takes News in real time and - hopefully - feeds an LLM with RAG knowledge.

* Session: https://sessionize.com/app/speaker/session/621013
* Slides: TODO

## Description

How can we get an LLM to be updated to today‚Äôs news?
Gen AI is great at answering questions.. from the past. After the LLM was trained, all you can do is RAG.
How about crawling the web for latest news with Gemini for multimodal extraction and offering summarization by your favorite topic?
It all gets more exciting thanks to Andrei‚Äôs langchainrb gem.

## Other Ideas

My idea is to bring slides and a demo, all done in ruby leveraging nokogiri, langchainrb and possibly some capabilities in Langchainrb that Andrei is now building (*).

Slides: explain the overall idea, empathise with audience, show architecture diagram, why we‚Äôre here, and make people laugh.

My idea is to build a demo in two parts:
A crawler which crawls a few sample web pages, extract information using Gen AI to understand if they‚Äôre pertinent to certain topics (eg music, sport, politics, ..) and extract other information (eg Location).
Then, RAG-style, I‚Äôd feed an LLM and ask questions real time hoping to be able to surprise people with last-week news about different news sections. Like:
‚ÄúHow are presidential elections going? What‚Äôs the latest news?‚Äù
What‚Äôs latest with the ruby community?
.. hoping to retrieve very latest news.
Possibly, retrieve similar pictures/articles based on the questions (embedding style).

## App info

### Google Cloud info

Apps are on Cloud Run

* DEV: https://gemini-news-crawler-dev-x42ijqglgq-ew.a.run.app/pages/stats
* PROD: [ü´Ä health check PROD](https://gemini-news-crawler-prod-x42ijqglgq-ew.a.run.app/up)

### TODOs

*  add Devise for user mgmt
*  add Cloud Run IAP: https://blog.cloud66.com/authenticating_users_with_google_iap_in_rails
* Auto feed continuously. Currently

### Autofeed now

1. `cd crawler/ ; $ make crawl-a-lot`

### esbuild issues

This didnt work:
* `rails-ric webapp`
* this didnt work. Will do again with tailwind but without esbuild
* rails new "$1" -j esbuild --css tailwind

Lets try a second timeüßÆ

```bash
rails new webapp --database=postgresql --css tailwind
rm -rf webapp/.git
git add webapp
```

* `rails-which-javascript-env ` should say ESBUILD since i installed it with it :)

## Nice to haves

* Add Gemini function calling for getting News.
