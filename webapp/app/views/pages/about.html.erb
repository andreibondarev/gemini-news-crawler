  <p> This page has been built for a Gemini demo.</p>

  <p></p>This is a News Slurper that takes News in real time and - hopefully - feeds an LLM with RAG knowledge.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
  How can we get an LLM to be updated to today’s news?
</p>
<p>
Gen AI is great at answering questions.. from the past. After the LLM was trained, all you can do is RAG.
How about crawling the web for latest news with Gemini for multimodal extraction and offering summarization by your favorite topic?
It all gets more exciting thanks to Andrei’s langchainrb gem.
